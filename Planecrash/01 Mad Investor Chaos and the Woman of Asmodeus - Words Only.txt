This story begins in a place that would be as seen by some other places a high trust society It happens that this place has no histories to call upon of earlier lower trust societies It is expected by this society that this historical amnesia will end up not being relevant to the vast vast supermajority of its members Had they thought otherwise they would have chosen otherwise They try to plan out everything important that way and then not plan out everything else to the point where it stops being fun Its that kind of society you see the kind with prediction markets and policy goals

The last plane trip of Kelthams first life starts out uneventful He boards the aircraft strolls a third of the way down the aisle with his eyes assessing all he passes and then sits next to the first person who looks like a more promising seat partner than all of the previous people he passed This is a woman reading alt 9 book 3 of Reckless Investor Miyalsvor a book series not entirely ungermane to his own life interests Keltham takes out his own copy of Three to Infinity by Petheriel reading it long enough for it to be a costly signal that he actually cares about the books content Maybe a conversation will start maybe it wont

The womans name is Thellim She is actually a fiction matchmaker whose interest in reckless investing is purely as fiction She does not aspire at all to the impossible and even self contradictory Art of investing in ways contrary to other investors wisdom even as all other investors try to do the same

Mad Investor Chaos as he sometimes calls himself sees no profits to be reaped from further conversation here After a bit of further cognition Keltham decides that the previously viewed portions of airplane didnt contain any significant promises he was passing up and its not worth moving seats to go looking again He gambled and lost and may as well finish reading his book

The two of them pass the plane trip mostly reading quietly to themselves until the point where the plane crashes and everyone dies

This place is very cold and very flat and has no particular distinguishing features Miles away there is smoke in the air as from a chimney 

Farther miles away theres a big soap bubble force field kind of thing

Shakingly but not slowly Keltham rolls to his feet does a rapid body check to see if he has any detectable injuries after his plane crashed and his head came off he is reasonably sure he remembers the sensation of his head being literally ripped off his neck It does seem to be back on though

Somewhat gingerly Keltham turns his head around to check for anything resembling a familiar or unfamiliar threat

Plausibly threatening the cold Its really quite cold The shrubs Theyre low to the ground and look spiky but not particularly threatening

Theres really not that much else It doesnt look like a place that has been particularly touched by human habitation 

The soap bubble forcefield thing looks deliberate It rises to the same height everywhere hard to judge from here but at least fifty feet and theres motion faintly visible on the other side of it hard to pick out at this distance and through the distortion moving four and six legged shapes

and the direction with smoke in the air

The smoke is maybe rising out of a building or something else grey and square and purposeful Its not very far from an edge of the soap bubble Between here and there theres frozen tundra and some small stunted trees 

Keltham takes a few moments to update his store of hypotheses on all this startling new evidence computing at the lightning speed of sheer wordless guessing that the posterior sums up to 

 nothing Yeah hes got nothing

Mad Investor Chaos heads off at a brisk heat generating stride in the direction of the smoke It preserves optionality between targeting the possible building and targeting the force bubble nearby

Up a little closer its clearly a building or actually a cluster of them all of them one story high all of them made of grey stone or painted like theyre made of grey stone Theres what might be people walking between the buildings periodically

The sun moves across the sky but not down in it

Its really cold

Yes thank you sensorium he is aware now that it is quite cold that is why he is not carefully thinking through all of this in much more detail in advance and is instead running towards the possible heat source whilst also generating more heat that way himself

When he gets close enough people see him They turn and wave nonchalantly and then keep going apparently the presence of a person racing across the tundra inappropriately dressed for the weather isnt notable in itself 

Possibility 1 that people materialize around here after death and run in towards the nearest buildings all the time

Possibility 2 that the people seeing him have entirely misinterpreted him as some other phenomenon not in need of heat

Possibility 3 that it is BUTT CHILLINGLY COLD and he needs to KEEP RUNNING into the nearest enterable building

Its door swings open for him Startled people turn to look at him now 

Something incomprehensible one of them says

OH GOOD WARMTH Keltham he says between breaths tapping himself Dath ilan making the gesture for thing A coming from thing B I died in a plane crash and woke up here Hope somebody here speaks Baseline or has a universal translator device

 they glance at a girl in the corner

She casts Tongues Say that again she says in Baseline

Keltham Dath ilan I died in a plane crash and woke up here Whats the correlation between the strange gesture you just did and your ability to communicate with me when you could not do so previously

This sentence takes less than half as many syllables to say in Baseline as in Taldane

 I cast Tongues because its a translation spell and you were speaking an unfamiliar language You died and woke up here This isnt an afterlife

Yeah I was wondering if thered been a mistake or systemic hiccup Id perhaps ask you how to get to a place people go when they are dead but I feel like first this possible systemic hiccup should be checked for profit potential

 thats a phrasing Uh I think Golarion hmmm I think probably most dying people would rather show up in Golarion than in a proper afterlife but theyre probably wrong about that I hadnt really thought about it before because I have never heard of such a mistake

I know nothing of this subject matter at all So far as my people know when you die either Civilization manages to retrieve your brain soul and wake you up much later or you stop existing I died under circumstances where my brain soul could not reasonably have been saved That I continue to exist at all is an unexplained violation of all expected laws of existence from my perspective If the same holds true from your perspective does my new world also have proverbs about violations of previously holding generalizations being interesting and profitable in proportion to the degree of previous belief in the generalization that was violated

Keltham has NO idea what is going on but he is SO ready to profit from it he has been waiting ALL HIS short LIFE for something generalization violating to profit from

All of this is also much faster to say in Baseline

 dead people usually go to afterlives she says Start with the bit you are confident about They dont cease to exist entirely usually that sounds awful Some people get eaten in their afterlives but its not you know a common thing and you can just not go to Abaddon which is the afterlife where you get eaten sorry the translations very 

 very 

 do you mean basically the thing where if you want to be a fabulously rich adventurer youd better have a damn good reason why the tomb you want to rob hasnt been robbed already but generalized to everything We dont have a proverb for that I dont think it does generalize to everything most things the reason why no ones dealt with them is that no one powerful could make that much money off it and it wouldnt be much fun 

Sounds like your universe is nothing like my universe We dont have places people go when they are dead We dont have translation spells And you dont have explicit math about inexploitable equilibria which implies a vast amount of other missing knowledge If youve never previously seen people like me showing up Id say a glitch has occurred and that is exactly the kind of situation where you might be able to feast on an exponentially vast buffet of profitable strategies that nobody else has tried before because they couldnt take advantage of the glitch

 well We have not seen dead people showing up before except if someone raises them as a zombie or resurrects them and the thing you described doesnt really sound like either of those things It does seem important to uh get Asmodeus in touch with your world so that we can collect the souls of your people when they die instead of them ceasing to exist

Yeah Like that That is exactly what I am talking about Current exchange rates on true deaths per labor hour Civilization will pay you at least a million labor hours per soul you can save that way though 

Civilization lives in an extremely and to all appearances perfectly regular mathematical universe Being able to descend causally from it and copy people out of it does not mean you can send information back and execute trade arrangements

 though Id bet at 4 to 1 that you cant actually get a two way arrangement with Civilization Im guessing Golarion can see dath ilan but dath ilan cant see Golarion But if we can manage to exploit any of the knowledge I have that this world doesnt I will pay Asmodeus for his impact in grabbing any dath ilani souls that would otherwise get lost Ive deliberately avoided fantasizing about what Ill do after Im a billionaire because becoming a billionaire is the hard part but Im not actually averse to the part where I spend whatever I cant manage to spend on my own personal happiness on producing public goods It is said for one thing that this tends to impress members of the opposite sex and so also contributes to personal happiness in the end

 all right sounds good Asmodeus is a god and I dont actually know that He would want a billion gold but I am sure Hell want something I can uh get a priest and let them know about this is it urgent you must not age if you just stop existing when you die 

Dath ilans got about a billion people ten million die per year about a hundred of those are true deaths so Poisson process expected three days until the next dath ilani death except that the plane I was on just crashed which is going to double the true death rate this year If Asmodeus can grab lost dath ilani from deaths that happened an hour ago but not a day ago thats pretty urgent Id ask whats a god but that is much less urgent

I dont know but maybe a priest will She starts walking out the door and towards another building Gods are entities that are much smarter and much more capable and very different from humans and they set up the afterlives Asmodeus is the one who is the patron of my country and also the most powerful one Whatre untrue deaths does that just mean youre able to raise them

Keltham takes a breath of warm air puts his hands in relatively warmer places and follows her out into the FREEZING COLD Not yet gonna take a much higher tech level If theyre dying under controlled circumstances we pump enough vitrifactants through them to prevent ice crystal formation chill em down to liquid nitrogen temperatures atoms move around but they move in one to one flows which seem pretty likely to map cognitively distinct start states to physically distinguishable end states Later when we can well scan the brain and figure out who the person was and rematerialize that person True death is when your plane crashes and splatters your brain all over the place and lets the pieces rot in the sun or burns them in jet fuel a process which maps many distinct possible people onto overlapping entropized ash heaps Keltham has a quite short time previously spent some very long minutes contemplating this fact and trying really hard to think of some incredibly clever way to have it not happen to him

Your language is really oddly optimized she says hurrying over to the towering somewhat ominous looking building with a red pentagram etched into the archway above the door I do know Asmodeus gets souls from other worlds sometimes because Barbatos the ruler of the first level of Hell got the appointment by bringing a whole world of souls for Asmodeus

You know anything else about the circumstances Were they from a world that didnt previously have an afterlife of their own or translation spells Keltham isnt sure how to parse ruler of the first level of Hell but he can ask later what a ruler is

Uh I heard that they became the barbazus but thats all I know Barbazus have spells now but I have no idea what they had when they were alive She knocks on the door and enters the ominous building it is symmetric in black stone with a large stone altar at the center

Oh good WARMTH again I think its gonna be high expected value to at some point very soon spend a lot of time explaining to me a whole lot of locally assumed knowledge that I dont have I cant figure out what knowledge I have that can be deployed to profit in this world if I dont know how this world works

Yes the spell lasts an hour but I can do an hour of trying to explain things and then tomorrow prepare better ones for this

She switches languages to have a hasty conversation with a robed man who listens his eyebrows rising steadily

 he says hell pray to Asmodeus about it

Does that mean we completed the time sensitive part of this in terms of notifying Asmodeus that theres a hundred dath ilani he can pick up if he can only do that for a limited time afterwards and then on average one more every three days

Yes I mean I dont know how soon Asmodeus will hear but there isnt more we can realistically do about it

You mention to the guy that on the 1 in 5 off chance you can actually trade with dath ilan those hundred souls are worth a hundred million hours of labor

I told him that your world has a billion people and that you were ready in a heartbeat to trade to Asmodeus whatever he wanted for protecting your dead It seems to me like it ought to get His attention but trying to understand gods with a mortal brain doesnt always work very well

If gods are smarter than humans shouldnt they be more understandable from a theoretical standpoint in the sense that they depart less often from the coherence theorems governing never mind if you dont have math about inexploitable equilibria you definitely dont have math about gods Yeah dont worry itll get Asmodeuss attention unless he already knows or immediately computes that he cant do it

 Carissas going to try not to feel insulted Lots of people have done lots of studying of gods Admittedly not usually with math that she is aware of If were needed for anything Im sure well be informed Should we sit down by a fire and I can try explaining things to you until my spell runs out

I dont have any better ideas Knowledge is definitely my rate limiting resource in how well I can exploit Golarion for mutual gain

 sure Okay Uh There are probably about a billion of us too I think lots more than ten million die in a year Ive heard people say that half of babies live to be adults The age of majoritys sixteen in Cheliax thats measured in time from the longest day of the year to the next one Im twenty five in those years Humans who dont die of anything or have resurrection on demand generally make it to eighty before they die of their body just falling apart its called aging its said that the gods did it because they dont want us to stick around here forever and never go to the afterlives Wizards can delay it make 130 or 140 or so Wizards are people like me whove learned how to cast spells

I have so many Additional Questions before I can understand this world as mostly in equilibrium Gonna say them out loud so you know what they are but I suspect the best strategy is for you to ignore it all and then move on to the next most important facts Like what kills that many kids How much would your people pay per child saved Why would gods pick eighty years instead of eight hundred Why are humans an efficient way of making things that get to afterlives if those are valuable Whats the rate limiting difficulty in learning to cast spells that stops everybody from learning it Also my reality has something that translated as aging and zero gods and we know where that kind of aging comes from that isnt gods but Ive got no idea if thats the same here Feel free to ignore all that confused babbling and just say whatever you wouldve said next anyways

In what equilibrium uh okay Do you want to write those down so you remember them There are nine afterlives Afterlives go by attributes that the gods use to see the world attributes that are more fundamental to gods than to us The attributes are Law versus Chaos and Good versus Evil Law is duty obedience authority following the rules Chaos is doing whatever you want hedonism non coordination Good is self sacrifice Evil is pursuit of the interests of the self The nine afterlives then are Hell Lawful Evil Axis Lawful Neutral Heaven Lawful Good Abaddon Neutral Evil the Boneyard True Neutral and Nirvana Neutral Good The Abyss Chaotic Evil the Maelstrom Chaotic Neutral and Elysium Chaotic Good Asmodeus rules Hell

Until a hundred years ago there was prophecy which is some kind of ability the gods and powerful wizards had to look into possible futures and sometimes nudge them make unlikely things come to be or fix a point in fate so that coincidences would bring the world to it But a hundred years ago it broke and there was a related worldwide catastrophe that toppled many empires and now things are sort of settling into a new way for them to be geopolitically and in terms of what the gods do I dont specifically know of any reason thats important but if youre interested in well with tombs theyve been around for thousands of years so the reason they havent been robbed must be good but if a tomb is new thats the reason and the current world situation is new 

Uh The most common kind of magic is being chosen by a god to do miracles on their behalf Thats five people in a hundred maybe We call them clerics The second most common kind is wizardry The smarter half of people can learn a little bit but only people who are well above average can learn very much Wizards used to be much rarer than clerics but now Cheliax has universal testing and education so we find the smart kids even if theyre farmers and were actually up to eight in a hundred people who can cast at least one spell which is the highest in the world Overall I think its one in a hundred or so Then there are lots and lots of rarer kinds Blood borne aptitudes for innate intuitive magic pacts with powerful entities that arent gods hybridization with other species than humans which have innate magic stuff like that 

The thing north of us with the forcefield is the Worldwound A hundred years ago when prophecy broke and Aroden died a chasm between this world and the Abyss opened up Demons started pouring through Demons are chaotic and Evil and they mostly like eating people so weve been trying to stop them from taking over the whole world Its going stably But peopled give you a lot of money to fix it if you figured out how

The Taldane words Lawful and Chaotic map onto Baseline words that respectively refer to deep underlying structures of things and disorganization both spoken with the inflection that indicates an everyday word is being repurposed to mean something else that it usually doesnt Good comes out as altruistic and Evil as negated prosocial both with the same inflection of technicality Baseline doesnt have a word for antisocial any more than it has a word for nonapples there are lots of specific things people could be doing that are antisocial but it hasnt been deemed wise to add a word that means what youre doing is bad for society but I wont tell you why

Writingd slow us down too much on the first pass Reactions to ignore The way the gods are parsing up these attributes seems very inhuman and probably isnt translating well but if gods all see things the same way they probably share ancestry as species or constructs Hedonism and non coordination seem uncorrelated to me though in terms of what chaotic translated to in my language we would definitely say Im on the chaotic side of what we see as the law versus chaos tradeoff Good versus Evil makes slightly more sense but I dont know where Get rich fund public goods impress the prettiest people and screw them is supposed to go on that Weve got no idea what our world was doing a hundred years ago but I expect we didnt have nuclear reactors then so were not in very much more of an equilibrium Who gets chosen by a god whats an example of the simplest thing you have to learn to be a wizard Gee that Worldwound sounds incredibly interesting could it maybe be closed if somebody knew more math how much money is a lot If there are gods running around who are smarter than humans then why dont you already know about inexploitable equilibria and all of the other math wouldnt the gods have invented it already actually that last one sounds fundamental enough I may want you to pause and answer it Its sort of weird that Keltham doesnt already know a lot more standard theory about agents that would be smarter than human now that Keltham thinks about it It seems like an obvious speculation on multiple levels

I am sure the gods have invented all the kinds of math youre thinking of they have very complicated god treaties with each other that involve kinds of interlocking commitments and ability to verify each others commitments and it was explained to me on a very simple level once just so I could understand what it was that I wasnt going to understand Why they havent taught us maybe the version of it we could understand wouldnt even be particularly useful to us Maybe theyre working up to it Maybe itd interfere with us having our purpose in Golarion which is generally understood to be as the product of one of those god treaties actually the gods disagreed about which afterlives souls should go to and the souls growing up in Golarion is meant to draw out their natural inclinations and also maybe give them a choice depending who you ask 

There are more complete accounts of whats Law and whats Chaos but they in fact dont hang together perfectly from a human angle because theyre god things not human things All the gods are in fact the same kind of entity whatever exactly that means some are more powerful than others but all of them have much more in common with each other than with a human even one who has enhanced their intelligence as far as it can go and is almost as smart as a god

I think if you want to get rich so you can attract pretty people and fund public goods thats Evil I think things have to be almost entirely purely selfless to be Good like if you were thinking I dont even care for money except that itll let me help starving orphans then Id wonder if you were maybe Good but its not enough to kick you out of Evil if you also do things that mostly benefit other people were all Evil and were up here fighting the Worldwound

Kids mostly die of disease Smallpox and measles and flu and cholera and so on Also some people kill their babies because they have babies and dont want them but that I dont think you could make any money stopping the whole point is that they dont care to have a baby and theyve nonetheless got one People who do want babies would pay a large chunk of their annual income to save them Id expect Especially once theyre bigger and youve already invested in them People get chosen by a god for being unusually aligned with the gods values Plans for humans Needs from an actor on Golarion I dont know that its completely characterized but its always someone close by in alignment and its always someone who mostly agrees with the gods priorities and usually its someone who can wax poetic about the beauty of the gods thing once you understand it even partially

To be a wizard you have to hold a spell in your head and be able to manipulate it in space properly I can show you in a bit

The number of questions being spawned per minute is increasing at a rate which makes Keltham worry about the overall convergence behavior of this process

Reactions starting to overload here Interlocking commitments and verification do not sound like math wed call complicated somebody first walked me through the surface results at age 10 and then since Im planning on being an actual investor I walked through the proper proofs at 14 It sounds like existence here begins as a multiagent equilibrium of gods negotiating in the same way that dath ilan begins as an equilibrium of physics natural selection and human desires possibly if I want to understand everything in proper order I should start with the gods Are souls a fundamental unit of value underlying all economics here Were humans here dying forever until the gods showed up in which case we owe them or do the gods culture humans in order to get more souls in which case they owe us How do humans enhance their intelligence and end up almost as smart as gods Why does anybody spend money on anything else if you can spend money on that How smart are we talking about exactly use whatever units you like to give me any idea at all What do clerics do for gods what do clerics get in return from gods what if anything do humans get out of this whole system

And you know I am on the extreme end of what my people call chaos and aspire to go further than that when it comes to breaking the stultifying regularities that settle over human beings thinking and acting in groups Ive been known to go by the Network handle of Mad Investor Chaos But Decide you want kids then change your mind and kill them is fifteen hundred times more chaotic than than Ive ever I mean How about if instead you think about your own preferences more clearly before taking yourself off contraception and save yourself nine months of pregnancy Doesnt that constitute an outright preference reversal where you could end up with more time and resources if you didnt have kids in the first place Isnt that prima facie time inconsistent behavior barring psychologically unrealistic arbitrary complexities of the utility function I I mean theres being chaotic and then theres being so chaotic that it violates coherence theorems We have now answered the question of how much chaos it takes to make Mad Investor Chaos feel physically nauseated What is wrong with those people Why is anyone not buying the kids None of that seems like the actual info I need next and I probably shouldnt be asking

 People buy orphaned kids but newborn babies are a pain to take care of so I dont think theres much of a market probably if you wanted you could buy em and raise them though not in Cheliax which prohibits human slavery People dont think they want a baby and then change their mind they never wanted a baby in the first place but they still had sex because they thought theyd timed it well enough a baby wouldnt result or theyre fifteen and impulsive or they wanted to have sex more than they dispreferred pregnancy or they were raped or they had an abusive boyfriend whod beat them if they turned him down or they figured they could handle the baby but then the dad skipped town and now they couldnt or they thought their family would help and then family circumstances changed or they figured theyd abort the pregnancy but then access to that which is not universal vanished for some reason Or I know someone who got an abortion and it had side effects and made her permanently infertile freaked me right out so if Id gotten pregnant as a teenager I mightve figured infanticide would be better and instead I just didnt have the kind of sex that gets you pregnant but I have more options than your average teenage girl

You get smart enough to be almost as smart as gods with magic items It costs more than most people will ever make in their life people who can afford it usually do do it When Im richer Ill get a headband People spend money on other things because otherwise they would starve Or because they like living in a nice house and having nice things and having servants and the costs of those things is negligible compared to the costs of intelligence enhancement 

Souls are valuable I dont know if theyre like theyre mostly valuable to gods and people dont directly trade with gods very much if youre trading with humans the most important things are food and textiles and on the high end diamonds and spellsilver which are scarce components to magic items I think the gods culture humans in order to get more souls but I dont know in what sense that means they owe us its not like if we told them that they should be nicer to us there would be a compelling reason for them to listen Clerics evangelize for a god and take care of their followers and run their churches and fight their wars Gods give clerics the ability to heal injuries and resurrect the dead and fight people more effectively Humans get afterlives and healing and in the case of Cheliax Asmodeus supplies us with material wealth from Hell so we can afford a decent education system unlike all the other countries which are too poor to have that

Yeah so okay either yall are acting optimally with respect to alien problems I dont understand or yall got very different utility functions or all yall aint got no idea what the ass you be doin and are ending up way below the multi agent optimal boundary on levels where that goes from fun profit opportunity to not so fun emergency massive profit opportunity

Extremely Chaos aligned dath ilani are sometimes known in moments of great gravity to deliberately speak Baseline with nonstandard grammar

But regardless of which branch of that trilemma if any is actualized it sounds like you definitely have unsolved problems that are solved problems where I come from Like safe reversible contraception So either none of my worlds solutions apply here because the laws are different or I bring with me knowledge and methodologies that are profitable Though more likely the first branch of that dilemma is actualized if there are smart gods here who wouldve already worked out those solutions Except that you just said that gods have destructive conflicts that their clerics help them fight which either theres a translation difficulty here or you just described the page one of textbook result that should not happen between sufficiently smart entities who can do logical commitments and verify them If the strategies are ending up with overt destructive actions being carried out in reality and not just in decision theoretic counterfactual threat branches of reality thats the page one of textbook non actualized outcome where both entities could execute different actions and would both end up with higher payoffs

This is a three syllable word in Baseline Keltham has been trying to use those sparingly so as to keep his sentences and concepts simple and likely to pass neatly across whatever translation barrier exists

The gods outright fight each other almost never That is what happened a hundred years ago and my understanding is that it was in fact a ridiculous anomaly of some kind maybe to do with prophecy breaking and the strategies the gods used for commitments all breaking I have never heard of it happening before or since Their churches go to war on Golarion regularly but I doubt that destroys resources that the gods value It kills people but their souls are fine and casters become more powerful in high conflict situations and people get more religious when theres lots of war I think 

Safe reversible contraception sounds very good and you could sell that for lots of money 

My current best theory for predicting the next thing youre going to say and or be confused about is that so Cheliax is richer than most places and its got more Law and less of the bad things you were confused about and more of peoples preferences being consistent over time of things that are a good use of resources for the long term happening even if it doesnt benefit anyone until the long term of not going to war compared to other places So extrapolating that wildly your world sounds like a place that is even richer and even Lawfuler to the point the distinction between Good and Evil doesnt even matter much to people since you havent got afterlives and all the parts of Evil which actually involve hurting other people on purpose have been Lawed out of existence

Oh it matters See even after you get rich and Law all that stuff out of existence Very Serious People go on worrying about whether it will come back a hundred years later if we let ourselves start to drift evolutionarily on the Good Evil axis I hadnt actually been informed as yet but considering the choices I made in some test pranks as a kid I expect Id have been told a few years later that my place on the Good Evil axis wouldnt have entitled me to much support for having kids of my own Which fine fair enough if Im the sort of person who goes around constantly assessing how much reciprocation other people owe me instead of just being nice I shouldnt be too surprised if Civilization decides it doesnt owe me much Because what have I done for them right under the rules the way I say they should work I can either prove theyre wrong about people like me being unnecessary or get out of the gene pool fair enough My ambition before I ended up here was to fairly make a billion labor hours and then marry about two dozen women and have about a hundred and forty four kids The first part to show them how much they need people like me and the second part to unilaterally give the next generation some more people like me whether the rest of Civilization likes that or not

 which I should probably just never think about again because this world is not and never will be a test of my ability to shine inside Civilization If I win here it wont be because I was special itll be because I came in with a ton of knowledge that any other dath ilani might have And if I lose here itll be because there were gods smarter than any human being who ate all the low hanging fruit that anybody at all in dath ilan couldve found But hey Im adaptable I can reorient my entire life might take me a couple of minutes but I can do it I just felt it might be helpful to say out loud once before it all drifts away Help if somebody else knew even for a halfminute before I let it go

Moving on If churches are going to war it means that the gods being smart doesnt prevent humans from being stupid not sure why but it obviously doesnt so maybe I can still help there Priority question how much of my knowledge still holds here if any Does running electricity through water produce two gases one of them lighter than air which can be burned to yield water again If molecular chemistry is the same higher levels of organization will probably also be the same and knowledge about steelmaking or that synthetic hormones can signal the female reproductive system to not ovulate will probably also hold

Just being nice is very stupid if your planets selecting for that theyre going to have horrible problems the first time they encounter anyone else Im not an alchemist I can look it up but probably after the translation spell runs out unless that information is really important information

If nice sounds like a kind of thing that can be stupid weve got some kind of translation difficulty running thats a type error Nice is part of the utility function If you dont already know that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen it probably isnt I guess you could just not know what anything is made of Do you know what water is made of thats not two one proton atoms and one eight proton atom

I dont know what a proton is Water freezes at a little above the ambient air temperature outdoors here at the Worldwound in the summer and floats when its ice and boils at a temperature you can get over a normal nonmagical fire and then is steam and holds heat well compared to metal or plant matter or something When it freezes in the sky it forms snowflakes

Sounds correct Do snowflakes have six sided structure under a microscope Where I come from that happens because molecules with two hydrogen and one oxygen have a least energy crystal configuration thats hexagonal If all of that is still true and for the same reasons then I still know how to make advanced steel and build electrical generators And the methodology I know to regenerate more of that knowledge will apply unchanged Male and female reversible contraception was tech in a relatively advanced state where I cant reproduce it directly I can reproduce the methodology that generates it

Snowflakes have six sides Whats steel used for whatre electrical generators used for 

You dont have steel Right then if steel is a possible thing here and you dont have it thats step one in climbing the tech tree Its a metal thats harder than other metals while still possible to work with at all variations on it dont rust keep edges better and so on Whats your current advanced metallurgy like Bronze iron 

Magic weapons They dont rust and keep an edge perfectly and they last forever We have bronze and iron Ive seen work done in steel but Ive also seen work done in adamantine mithril skymetal theres lots of metals that exist but arent mass producible and I dont know what theyd be used for if they were

Huh Yeah some of those terms arent translating I wonder if I actually know anything portable about steel or theres just some nearly analogous metal here or if steel still exists but theres processes that dont exist in dath ilan for building other metals above or beyond it Lets try a basic tech on a higher level of organization How expensive is it to produce a thousand copies of one book and how would you do that 

I think it costs about what a laborer would earn in three years to get a thousand copies and youd go to a printing shop where theyd line up moveable metal tile things with letters on them to make the pages and then ink them and stamp the parchment I think the biggest contributing expense is the paper and the binding Cheliax releases national histories every few years but I dont think other places can afford to do that

You got printing presses okay I may or may not know anything useful about cheaper paper if a books worth of paper costs a days wages Lets try refrigeration how expensive is ice in hotter climates and what would you do to get it

 I think you mostly cannot buy ice in Cheliax I guess you could have someone ship it from the far north but I dont know this to have ever been done commercially and my fathers a merchant I was broadly familiar with the things people were trying commercially in shipping Probably youd pay a spellcaster to prepare and cast Snowball for you which would cost ten laborer days and be about a hands ful

Keltham rapidly rubs his hands together It produces heat

If heat is still disorganized kinetic energy expanding and compressing gases should make them colder and hotter

Promising I very likely know how to turn mechanical motion into cold without using magic maybe using a river waterwheel as the kinetic source Not sure how well itll scale at your tech level with any luck its two orders of magnitude past Snowball enough to enable food preservation at scale if you dont already have that I dont actually have a good sense for how that tech scales costwise Worth having a backup plan Do your seagoing ships travel against the wind

They know techniques for adjusting the sails so you can still make some ground They havent got something better than wind to power them except I met a Tian man once who claimed in his country tamed sea creatures towed them

Dont know if my worlds standard primitive sailing technique is better or worse We can check later I have notions of how to build nonmagical powered engines for ships too but theyre higher up the tech tree and take fuel and steel and engineering

The conventional guess among my people is that steel better steel cheaper steel fall among the first things you should try to sell or not sell to a civilization climbing the tech tree We dont actually know what the past was like in that regard but the conventional guess is that materials technology would end up being the rate limit on most other inventions Like the standard guess is that things to do with better steel end up being obvious when a lot of people are all trying to figure it out so its the quality and quantity of steel they have that ends up limiting their technology because exploring metallurgy is hard in a way that thinking up the printing press is not I wish I knew more about how that conventional wisdom was generated but since I dont know its not implausible I should treat that as my point of departure If the metals better than your current steel are still rare and expensive more and better steel should still be worth something

Supposing thats true and it makes my knowledge valuable where do I go from there Including getting past basic accommodations quickly As you say this seems like a poor society and I come from a rich one so Id like to spend as little time as possible being poor around here Unless Asmodeus sees me as having done him a favor with the dath ilan soul tipoff but Im not clear on whether that constitutes a favor And in fact youve said some ominous things about gods which would lead me to have second thoughts about doing them favors if theyre not the sort to repay favors to non gods who cant logically verify their expected reciprocation Which would seem dumb to me because of the exact chain of logic I just went through I mean non gods can generalize over the visible past behavior of gods in cases like that

It is better to have done Asmodeus a favor than not have done Asmodeus a favor in terms of Asmodeuss inclinations towards you I think probably the churchll give you money and a nice place to stay once I explain all of this You should not count on that with nonLawful gods though theyre still mostly excluding Nethys sane and aware mortals can track our incentives probably the churchll want you back in Cheliax not here at the Worldwound where sometimes there are demons I think youll like it better the weathers nicer and there are more nice things of the sort I presume youre accustomed to are there specifics I should mention The running list in her head already is admiration women money beyond ability to spend it which seems like quite enough really but maybe also he likes a specific fruit

Probably but at this point I have no idea what they are If I want to cool my house in summer in Cheliax it sounds like I either need to get rich enough to hire wizards or like invent air conditioning first So it sounds like all of dath ilan registers as Lawful and Evil on your whacked out scales but are there exactly nine gods total or is there more than one Lawful Evil god I might want to work for For that matter I might want to check out exactly what the Lawful Neutral and Neutral Evil gods are like maybe the Neutral Evil one pays ten times as much to make up for being unreliable

The church is super not going to let him leave Uh Lawful Neutrals Abadar youd probably get along but He doesnt have a presence in Cheliax and Cheliax is the richest country and the place it makes sense to start things The other Lawful Evil gods are arguably not proper divinities in their own right and dont have independent churches they work for Asmodeus I think He cleared out independent Lawful Evil competition before humans had writing except for Zon Kuthon whos the god of pain and misery long story The Neutral Evil gods are uh Urgathoa goddess of disease and the undead Ive never heard anything about Her paying well and Norgorber whos an ascended human so thats promising in terms of being more aligned with humans but also Hes the god of crime and assassins and I am not sure how interested Hed be in this project which sounds like it optimistically involves no crimes and mostly only defensive dealings with assassins

I would have intuitively hoped going on the description you gave me that there is somewhere a Neutral Evil god of people pursuing their own sunlit interests without fretting about whether they are being too lawful or too chaotic Also ascended human whoa possible new life goal how does one do that and does it trash your existing personality

 giggle Theres a rock called the Starstone in Absalom its behind magical protections Aroden put in place and the purpose and nature of which He hid with magic and never clarified you can touch it and ascend to godhood hundreds of people try every year the last success was about a thousand years ago personality seems in some ways intact As much as it could be I guess when youre getting that much smarter and getting a bunch of new sensory modalities and operating in a completely different context But people stay the same alignment and some of their holy books detail new god perspectives on the events of their life so they at least remember it and can have opinions about it

There might be somewhere a Neutral Evil god pursuing its own interests without worrying about Law or Chaos but if so their interests dont include the people of Golarion knowing about them

Thats unfortunate because I cant deal with them but at the same time its hilarious I mean if I ascended I would not actually fuck off and leave everyone else to go rot with no stainless steel but the counterfactual me that does is within eyesight among the counterfactual universes I wonder if knowing god math has anything to do with being able to touch the Starstone Seems worth a quick shot if trying is cheap

I mean the overwhelming majority of failures die Theyre usually high enough level adventurers they just arrange a resurrection in advance if they want it but I dont know that the churchll front you that

Resurrection is advanced clerics right Can you give me a quick description of how one becomes a basic cleric or basic wizard I am wondering if knowing god math or knowing regular math makes me sufficiently talented to do those without despecializing from my other work and it seems like even small services there are worth tons

Wizards learn how to manipulate and stabilize spells and then spend an hour every day you can learn how to do it faster Im working on it but average is an hour preparing and stabilizing their spells at which point they can cast them on very short notice with a couple seconds of work Cheliax tracks people to be wizards at 14 and generally if you havent washed out you can reliably cast and retrieve cantrips at 16 Possibly an adult with all the math background and none of the spell background can pick it up in days or weeks More complicated spells are the same thing but you need to follow more complicated math and you need more working memory which necklaces are great for the specific math is topology did that translate 

Closed sets open sets fixed point mappings I was okay at topology at age 12 didnt follow up probably better at it now Hour a day sounds expensive in time but itd be nice to have an instant employment fallback option Clerics

Yes that sounds like the right kind of math I can check if youre smart enough to be a wizard if you want theres a spell for checking that For clerics a god picks you Usually when you pray to them not necessarily the first time you pray to them but the first time youve grown up in some relevant way or understood something new sometimes its just at an apparently random time though They get more powerful through time in their gods service and deeds in their gods service and sometimes again apparently at random Im sure its nonrandom from a godperspective

Pray

Uh you clear your environment of distractions and kneel on the floor and try to acknowledge that youre in the presence or could be of something much bigger than yourself something that can see much farther and you think about their priorities and your desire to serve them and sometimes ask for things but like the strength to do Your will sorts of things not for things to specifically go your way since the god knows better about whats best

Do people who become clerics ever regret that in retrospective expectation without benefit of hindsight Can you easily resign the position and pick another god if it doesnt work out Is successfully praying enough evidence of purpose alignment that it never happens with a god youd rather not partner with under reflective equilibrium Im wondering if theres any reason I should not just immediately do this with Asmodeus and cut out the middleman in case that other cleric decided he needed to go cut his toenails first

 I think probably you should do it but you might be too Chaotic or something or insufficiently informed about the things about Asmodeus that youre going to object to so I expect it to not work I have never heard of anyone regretting become a cleric except if they eventually got ex clericed which I think can be traumatic I think if you no longer want to serve the god thatd probably break clerichood or if you change alignments to be too far from the god that does it though I havent heard of anyone breaking clerichood on purpose

Yeah Im getting the impression that gods are very much the big factions here and if thats true I am starting to wonder whether becoming a cleric is an obvious sort of thing to try if you dont want to get noisily moved around by clerics supposedly on behalf of gods maybe but maybe in fact the clerics dont even know logical decision theory and start wars How is being ex clericed traumatic Is the part where nobody does that on purpose because its so traumatic Or because nobody forms a successful cleric bond unless theyre gonna get along great with the god

I think mostly people dont form a bond if they wont get along with the god and also if youre clericed then the church is yours it trains you and pays you and gets you help and guidance and is full of people like you which for lots of people is hard to find and also you get magic powers which you get in the habit of using for everything from drinking water to temperature tolerance to lighting magic can make hot weather feel nice that might be part of why we dont have a ice industry and then being de clericed is being told you arent worth that and losing your magic powers and losing your job and losing your economically valuable skills I dont know any ex clerics though

Can you talk to a god without being a cleric Have you ever communicated with Asmodeus

You can There are a billion people and gods have maybe a hundred thousand times peoples attentional capacity but theyre also not spending most of it talking to people on Golarion there are other planets and other things theyre doing on their own planes Also reportedly gods talking to you causes significant pain afterwards if youre not using a high level cleric spell that prepares you for it Because your brain is just doing a bunch of stuff brains dont do on their own and then the resetting afterwards involves the brain sort of flailing wildly But sometimes gods talk to people who arent their clerics if theyre paying enough attention to notice and its important enough

He doesnt want to be too obvious about the meaning of the next question so hed better toss in a distractor first I guess if the gods can talk to non clerics thats some evidence against the picture I was building up where the clerics might be misrepresenting what gods say and thats why some of this picture doesnt make sense in terms of smarter than human beings acting in coherent ways The part about clerics ending up fighting wars is still very strange even if it didnt destroy much that gods care about Its much more a behavior Id expect from flailing nongods under the influence of something like Chaos if Chaos here is a kind of reified factor that can affect people But I may be stupidly missing the extreme basics of the equilibrium of this entire world Is it possible for you to quickly sketch out who the major factions are and what they bargained for in the god equilibrium that underlies everything So far I know about Asmodeus the Lawful Evil god of people pursuing selfish interests but in an organized way that Id ordinarily say is icky except that your standard of Chaos is fifteen hundred times more Chaotic than I want to be Norburger god of killing people for money and Abedder

In fact Keltham has carefully memorized the names Norgorber Neutral Evil god of crime and assassinations and Abadar Lawful Neutral god that Keltham would probably get along with but he does not wish to show that he has

Yeah So the biggest thing is that there was a very powerful god Rovagug who ate planets and had eaten a bunch of them already when He came to Golarion and it took an alliance of all of the non Chaotic gods to stop him from eating Golarion too and He couldnt be destroyed but they imprisoned Him People say in the center of the world but I think thats probably a metaphor But the imprisonment took the cooperation of all of Them and I think any of Them could let Him loose so thats sort of the base of the god agreements that all of the gods have to continue thinking Golarion ought to go on existing under any particular conditions on Golarion that obtain or They could just destroy it

The restrictions on cleric magic are generally understood to be part of a godagreement for basically the same reason that if any god who wanted could just put much more of Themself into Golarion then the others would have to do it reciprocally and then thered be much less space for mortals doing mortal things and so clerics are restricted to the more positive sum set of the things they could potentially be enabled to do 

The afterlives are a godagreement Each plane gets to do its own thing and gets those souls judged by Pharasma who is True Neutral to be theirs Abaddon Neutral Evil defected on that they eat their souls and they were eating some directly from the transit to judgment instead of waiting until they were theirs so Pharasma changed the rules and now people damned to Abaddon can choose Hell or the Abyss instead and also most of the other afterlives volunteered some forces to defend the souls on their way to judgment 

Asmodeus has agreements with most of the other gods that protect Hell and the souls in it and advance His goals elsewhere I know Hes a party to lots of things protecting Golarion continuing to exist and the sorting system for afterlives and the compromise that cuts Abaddon out and I think also agreements about intervention among the afterlives with each other and with worlds other than Golarion I know that long ago the gods broke into coalitions that disagreed on what we called free will what I think youd call preference incoherence the thing about humans where occasionally we dont do whats in our interests and Asmodeus was opposed to it and in Hell teaches it out of people 

Good and Evil are opposed but the Lawful Good and Lawful Evil afterlives dont fight each other directly which is a godagreement of some kind The Lawful Good gods are Erastil who does agriculture Iomedae who is an ascended human and the god of the fight against Evil Shizuru who I think used to do things on Golarion but lost interest millennia ago Shes got a residual church in Tian Xia though and some minor ones probably I dont think the Lawful Good side has unified priorities Iomedaes all about defeating Evil but I dont think the other gods care about that very much Iomedaes the one whos a signatory to the Worldwound treaty 

Sarenraes the Neutral Good goddess of redemption the potential for goodness in everybody and her afterlife spends most of its resources on arguing at Pharasmas trials that every single person should be sorted as Neutral Good even if theyre quite cheerful about being headed elsewhere on a principle about how theres Goodness in everyone She smote an entire city once for defying Her will and She was instrumental in the Rovagug truce I dont know much about Her Shes popular in the Kelesh Empire Shelyns the Neutral Good God of love and beauty and joy and music Shes in favor of those things I guess I dont know Her to be in any important agreements either which doesnt mean She isnt but theyre probably not ones relevant to Golarion or to Asmodeus

When you say Asmodeus teaches people to be more coherent are we talking teaching people to not have kids and kill them or like full scale Keeper lets see how much god math humans can become and wield coherence Is Iomedae fighting Abaddon eating souls or also fighting Asmodeus Whats the entire anti Worldwound coalition Where does Norburger or Abedder fit in

Iomedae fights Abaddon eating souls but also fights Asmodeus or they dont fight but theyre opposed and their agreements are the agreements of enemies renegotiated off relative power levels Because Hes also Evil The anti Worldwound coalition is Sarenrae Iomedae Calistria who I didnt get to shes the Chaotic Neutral goddess of revenge Abadar and Asmodeus mainly Im sure there are other gods involved but They dont have large forces committed here and They arent among the advertised churches you have obligations towards under the treaty though the treaty also imposes obligations towards anyone who is here and fighting the Worldwound regardless of their god I have no idea what a full scale Keeper is but devils the kind of being that people turn into in Hell are not just people who dont have kids and kill them theyre much more different than that I suppose some of them eventually become mostly god math because some of them eventually become mostly gods

How is revenge Chaotic what Not punishing defections is the kind of defect of instrumental strategy that you could mistake as niceness but is actually stupidity feel free to ignore that if the answer is gods just not seeing the world the way humans do Are there afterlives besides Neutral Evil where people dont turn into mostly god math given enough time What did Calistria Abadar and Norburger bargain for in the god equilibrium

Uh I agree that not punishing defections is youd think nice actually stupid but I dont think Calistrians are very interested in only punishing defection as opposed to bad things in full generality and I dont think they care about the punishment being systematic calibrated in punitiveness theyre not a legal system Maybe revenge is the wrong word Reversals of power relations I agree revenge could be a perfectly good Lawful Evil domain if approached differently

In the Abyss people turn into demons In the Maelstrom the Chaotic Neutral afterlife they turn into chaos beasts which cant interact with causality the Maelstrom doesnt have any in Elysium I have no idea In Nirvana they turn into animals for unclear reasons The True Neutral afterlife kicks you out into other afterlives as soon as you develop a slant on Law Chaos or Good Evil but if you manage to never I think you turn into a very specialized kind of godmath aimed at enabling the sorting Heaven and Axis I think work mostly like Hell in that eventually you turn into mostly godmath but with like different emphasis Heavenll strip all the Evil out of you and Axis I think just makes you pure Law with no other desires

I have no idea what Calistria Abadar and Norgorber bargained for

Keltham keeps a neutral face It is in dath ilan mostly a theoretical study because the incentives have been set up not to do that to punish any attempt at doing that But he is starting to wonder if possibly the woman in front of him is a theoretical entity that ought to appear in only counterfactual branches of reality The overtly biased salesperson speaking bad judgments of a sort she can potentially be caught out on later and for which she will not later be able to plausibly present an unbiased line of reasoning leading there after rewinding hindsight for purposes of executing more favorable trades now It seems like the sort of thing that could go along with a world in which people end up fighting wars It is possible though by no means certain that this information is being filtered

In the Chaotic Neutral afterlife you cant interact with causality hm Maybe its just a translation error but

Huh What do clerics or other faction members of Calistria Abadar and Norgorber do in practice

Calistria runs abortion clinics and shelters for women whove made marriage vows and want to run out on them Often for good reasons like that their husband sucks Abadar runs Osirion which is a country south of Cheliax and runs banks in other places Norgorbers followers are mostly criminal gangs Orders of assassins most of them that Ive heard of but overwhelmingly criminals arent assassins and other kinds are less notorious so I bet its mostly less notorious kinds of crime

Did you want me to do the thing that checks if you are smart enough to learn to be a wizard I bet you are but if you are I can ask them to also get a spellbook for you while they set up somewhere nice

Cost side effects is there a reason to bother running it if I can already prove basic theorems in topology Also snerk about the Lawful Neutral god running the banking system I was about to ask how you did banking in such a way as to not make a profit for yourself or try to benefit anybody else but then I realized that a crazy ideal bank setting ideal prices would drive all other banks out of business so of course the Lawful Neutral god runs the banks Not sure why you think Id get along with that god that is very not the kind of investing I aspire to Is there a Lawful Good god of unselfishly wanting people to know more stuff and figure out more stuff Obviously I couldnt be their cleric but theyd be the god whose thingy benefits most directly when I disseminate knowledge and methods of creating knowledge They should potentially be going in with Asmodeus on backing me if Lawful Good and Lawful Evil ever do mutual projects Separate dumb question to ignore how do Chaotic gods think at all let alone be smarter than human Cognition is built of shards and fragments of higher mathematical structures that wed consider extremely the word that translates to us as lawful unless the godly concept of Law and Chaos only applies to overt social behaviors

Is he being too obvious in his strategic objectives as inferable from his tactical maneuvering despite the distractors hes throwing in Not much he can do about that without slowing down and hes under a time limit

Good and Evil do collaborative projects sometimes and this sure sounds like one but I dont actually know of a Lawful Good god with prosperity in their domain The reason why youd hear in Cheliax is that Good people are so obsessed with unselfishness that their societies cant even sustain positive sum things like wealth that run on selfishness and I think the way a paladin would say it is that wealth invites greed and corruption and so on and societies that are trying too hard at pursuing it lose the selflessness She is at this point dancing along the line of saying things that are supportive of other churches which is illegal but letting him decide he cant work with Cheliax would be catastrophic too Plausibly she should pretend the spell has run out but it has six minutes more and maybe he could tell I dont know that much about Chaotic gods theyre barred in Cheliax because Asmodeus mostly cant form god agreements with them I think just thinking of things I know about and I dont know all that much about gods you can have a very short time horizon or very high discounting so you dont care very much if your values will be different tomorrow because you dont care much about anything that happens tomorrow and will trade off lots of it for things that happen today you can probably have the equivalent of that in dimensions other than time you can prefer that future instances of you share your values but otherwise have entirely different attributes I think gods have lots of attributes that are not overdetermined by their values you can I dont really know Some kinds of outsiders you can summon and ask this stuff but obviously you cant summon full on chaos beasts and the things you can summon from the Maelstrom are generally not very easy to get answers out of is my understanding

Interesting Push on that slightly harder and see what happens Maybe his strategy will then be too obvious but inferring other peoples strategies from the infinite possibility space seems like it should actually be hard or at least fiction writers talk about how often their readers misinterpret them even when trying to telegraph things

Not a god of prosperity a god of teaching Knowledge Aside from everything to do with parents and kids people who unselfishly want other people to gain knowledge are like one of the few examples I can think of Good that doesnt seem fully inhuman Im not one of them but there are dath ilani teachers who want you to learn their whole subject matter in a way that seems as unselfish as anything ever gets And more importantly there are people driven towards gaining new knowledge in a way that should code as either Good or Neutral as I understand it If theres a god for that and people going with that faction are actually competent at the gods thing I am going to need the best of those people if I try anything on the order of reconstructing a nonmagical sailless ship The sort of people who invent math before any wizards have a use for it because they are just that obsessed with math Those people Is there a god for that one

A god of teaching Im pretty sure not I can ask once the spell runs out and give you a signal yes or no yes looks like this no looks like this my books list all the gods including the minor ones by domain and there are lots of minor ones but that I expect Id have heard of its not a rare profession exactly my mothers a teacher honestly I think lots of people like that are Neutral and worship Nethys the god of magic and knowledge Nethys is said to be omniscient but Hes also insane His plans dont make any sense on the material world and his clerics get steadily less capable of talking about things to humans over time and usually blow themselves up doing ridiculous magic experiments Irori is a Vudrani god ascended human of perfect self knowledge no I guess that doesnt seem like the thing either 

Sounds like were running out of time Are we running out of time

Yes Last questions Planning to get you nice accommodations spellbook writing implements look up gods

Sounds correct Look Im sorry if this is impugning your honesty but I hope you realize that Im in a strange place with a visibly low level of Law where people fight destructive conflicts I do not actually know that people here have set up all the careful structures and customs you use to incentivize honest business arrangements I am going to be taking some precautions based on that and I am genuinely sorry if those are unnecessary and lead to suboptimal outcomes from your own perspective but please consider my own ignorance

So you could have reported all that to me completely honestly and I just went picking for coincidences until I found some Or it could be not coincidence that youre willing to tell me the identifying things of all the Good and Neutral gods I cant become a cleric of but not actually give me Asmodeuss key identifying info plus theres supposedly no other Lawful Evil gods worth mentioning plus all the Neutral Evil gods you identified to me are horrible I am not actually going to get myself into a situation where other people are playing middleman between myself and Asmodeus and pawning off cute financial rewards on me while keeping the intelligence enhancement rewards to themselves Again sorry if youre not even considering that but I need to consider what your incentives might be I am currently considering options that include praying directly to Asmodeus about this tonight based on my guesses as to what the top Lawful Evil gods thing might be starting with making money If thats a terrible idea because for example I can accidentally get Iomedae if I accidentally think about how Im unhappy about the Abaddon business or because the existing Asmodeus clerics get snippy when somebody tries to talk to Asmodeus without them maybe explain very fast why I shouldnt do that Alternatively tell me how to make sure I get Asmodeus

I swear to you as a servant of Cheliax and of Asmodeus that as far as I know the Neutral Evil gods really do all seem to suck and there are none Im failing to mention deliberately for strategic reasons My best guess why is because Abaddon eats souls and anyone with better priorities hangs out somewhere else Asmodeus is also called the Prince of Hell or the Prince of Law Hell is nine planes and Hes on the deepest called Nessus His holy symbol is the pentagram his domains are tyranny slavery authority contracts and pride trying to pray to Him sounds like a good idea to me I pray to Him every night and nothings happened but no ones ever minded afara ghe esssent savat see a Gurre Helpless handwave 

Keltham tries for his best smile Thanks he says uselessly He draws a pentagram in the air to show he got that part

Hes very rapidly trying to invent an art form of playing inside counterfactuals that shouldnt exist where dath ilan teaches only arts that improve defense more than offense Given how much people complain about illusion of transparency even when people are trying to communicate Kelthams actual thoughts as a complete outsider to this system may in fact be fully opaque given the number of possibilities from her standpoint that she doesnt know how to rule out But if not if hes less safe than that maybe it will help that he tossed her one of his lesser suspicions as a distractor from some of his larger suspicions Because Keltham was not confident of his ability to completely conceal in his body language and attitude and pauses to think the fact that he has become suspicious from 

Did he actually forget to ask her name this whole time Keltham he says tagging himself again and then looks at her

Carissa

And she trots off to find the priest

Keltham will sit quite still trying to control the hammering of his heart and the visible sweating that might also be giving info away Stupid body it shouldnt reflect his thoughts like that during complicated negotiations

Carissa thought that he would think that her oaths meant something which is a good sign that the Algorithm is not completely unreflected here Though Carissa also thought she needed to swear in her capacity as a gods employee for her oath to mean something which is sort of awful and sad but also makes an awful kind of sense Among his current suspicions is that knowing logical decision theory may make it a little too easy to call out to gods and also entities like say Rovagug and thats why people here arent being taught the purer forms of the Algorithm left to struggle along with intuitive honor the Algorithms fragmentary emotional shards

It was in fact one of the more convincing things that Carissa could have done at the last not to convince him of that exact point but to show him that multiagent coordination still really holds here at all So that could be true or she could have correctly guessed what would convince him 

Hes not going to be able to guess her thoughts either across this level of social gap

But if Carissa is trustworthy probabilistically then he should not go with his Plan A to contact the Knowledge entity and ask for 25 of the orientation packet he can safely sustain because that way he will end up bringing his knowledge and methodology to this world Gambling on Carissas knowledge base having misinterpreted the natural tendency to mess with high energy reactions in a world with afterlives as drives everyone insane seems like a little too large of a gamble Nethys could also just know all the infohazards This is still Carissas world and not his 

This isnt what he should be thinking right now He should be reviewing the information he needs to remember

Pentagrams contracts authority pride the deepest layer Nessus of a nine layer plane

Abadar who runs the banks and a territory called Osirion The part about the prices being ideal prices was just a guess he was fishing for information via contradiction but Carissa didnt confirm or deny

Norgorber god of violating regulations and killing people for money whom Carissa swore was in a class all of whose members sucked

Calistria god of women who want to leave their husbands get abortions and get revenge Why this doesnt also apply symmetrically to men who want to leave their wives is one of the things he didnt have time to ask Carissa

Nethys god of knowledge and mad experimentation an extreme to which he could still be forced

And he supposes Sarenrae

Asmodeus Abadar Norgorber Calistria Nethys Sarenrae

Asmodeus Abadar Norgorber Calistria Nethys Sarenrae

The priest has his eyebrows raised and that of all things reminds Carissa to be terrified which shed been attempting to forget on the grounds that lyings harder than just having the right opinions in the first place Shes not sure that was the wrong tack but probably in hindsight this should have been handled by a specialist in dealing with prospective defectors from other countries someone who actually knows what they say about the gods in other places not just the things they say to Chelish soldiers in the uneasy context of the Worldwound truce 

Failing that she should probably have been stupider It was pride motivating her there hes obviously very clever and she doesnt like being outdone doesnt like hearing that god math is easy taught at a younger age than the age where she started training as a wizard 

 is he lying about that He gave a credible impression of being not very good at lying but thats only sort of lying really claiming you were twelve when you studied topology instead of twenty people exaggerate more when telling stories of their conquests and dont even consider it deception 

 if hes not lying about it then how Theres a classroom full of children of a given age as intelligent as Carissa in all Cheliax and itd be logistically difficult to put them in one place Maybe steel can do that 

He didnt mention being tracked for it maybe he was tracked for it and just didnt think it bore mention but he mentioned that they checked for Evil and thought he was somewhat there inclined and surely no society checks for Evil inclination and not for intelligence which is much more obvious and easier to test for 
Not impossible she concludes thinking about it if you have a good way of putting all the smartest children in your country in the same place But he doesnt carry himself like someone who thinks hes one of the smartest people in his country And no sane society would be discouraging its most intelligent people from having children 

 shes getting distracted She should be composing her report for the priest which should include these inferences and exclude the error analysis Theyll probably mindread her for it later but by then she can have shaped it to be a little more generous 

Hes from another world she says I think I think theyre smarter and Lawfuller and Im not entirely sure they have free will

The priest looks at her impassively 

Theres a billion of them Unless hes lying which with permission I can check in a minute Ive got a Detect Thoughts left people who are not particularly notably smart have the prerequisites for wizard education covered when theyre twelve not because they have wizardry or any reason to have treated it as an educational priority He wants to try to reinvent his worlds technology here I think he can do it I assume we want it done in Cheliax and probably that means you want to take him back there tonight because here theres nothing we can do if he talks to Iomedae and decides to walk out the door I think he is probably going to Plausibly going to try to talk to every god I mentioned He had lots of questions about them He has Chaotic sympathies and Im not sure if he believed me the Chaotic gods are no good for this And he was confused about why all the Evil gods outside Asmodeus areso terrible because he is lacking the context that Evil gods mostly hurt petitioners badly I only had 50 minutes and that always takes a really long time to explain to people in a way that doesnt send them running out the door screaming so I judged it better to omit it But he noticed uh that without that and without the context that heresy is prohibited in Cheliax and without the context that its recommended not to learn about other gods lest you get yourself in trouble then it doesnt quite hold together and I think hell have a lot of questions for someone who knows more than I about defectors and how to explain those things 

He said he wants to be so rich he cant keep track of how much money he has and to have lots of beautiful women to have lots of children by which I think was well obviously a normal motivation in its own right but it was significantly about his country not thinking he was particularly valuable to it I think you could get a lot of goodwill just by treating it as very obvious that we want ten thousand of him Which we might even if hes Chaotically inclined he gave a credible impression of not thinking people should commit crimes or overthrow governments and he wouldnt choose Abaddon

Did he like you the priest says

 an obvious question Shes unprepared for it in the sense her thoughts hadnt gotten there yet but not in the sense she feels at all surprised I dont know Or I think yes but possibly if you give him twenty pretty girls at that point itd be not particularly

Your recommendation is that I get him to Cheliax tonight

Yes Somewhere abundant in ways even a much richer world might not be abundant if they didnt have magic 

Ill talk to some people Go read his mind

She does that

Asmodeus Abadar Norgorber Calistria Nethys Sarenrae

Pentagram authority contracts pride banks and Osirion regulation violating and killing for money women getting revenge on their husbands but somehow not the other way around which like why the asymmetry no he needs to memorize not puzzle knowledge and mad experimentation Good in everyone And Carissa went out of her way to mention that Sarenrae had destroyed a city which like possibly reasons especially if people go places when they die But also implies maybe Carissa doesnt want Keltham talking to Sarenrae in particular which which mostly implies her trying to steer Keltham away from places that Keltham does not think he really wants to go He does not know that Carissa and himself are in anywhere near the level of zero sum destructive opposition where do the thing Carissa least wants you to do is a recipe for anything except suicidal contact with eldritch person transforming entities he should not touch Except that 

 hes just going to keep thinking this until he actually thinks it Its profoundly unhelpful and not at all the most important thing going on but hes going to actually think it just to get it over with

Once when Keltham was a child they placed him in an unreal situation as children are sometimes placed He saw a person in distress seemingly lightly injured but very lightly for dath ilan does not wish to distress its children too much in the course of testing them Just earlier that day also seemingly by coincidence Keltham had been told that a fine fun party awaited him but only if he arrived exactly on time to depart with others

So Keltham went out of his way to find an adult despite the party But Keltham also made very sure that the adult promised to share with him the credit for helping this person and told the injured person that he wanted to be paid for it plus extra for missing his party

Its hardly terrible even from an average dath ilani perspective that is if youre Keltham its not terrible at all He didnt refuse to help he just asked to be paid for it afterwards Cities wouldnt exclude Keltham on that basis if they could even access that information about him Dath ilan doesnt think him outcast like a murderer Its just that 

There are a few places besides just parenting and teaching where pure unselfish Good is a thing that humans ever do One of them is the will to help others in distress

Dath ilan has an image of what it wants to be It wants to be the sort of person who hears about Abaddon and is suffused with a pure horror that Keltham does not in fact feel He feels revolted and sad but he does not feel the thing that others feel when they hear about true death that would lead them to be able to contract with Iomedae on the basis of that alone and if strength of emotion counts for anything channel however much power of a god that lets them channel to tear one more soul out of Abaddon That is what dath ilan wants to be when it grows up And that is not what Keltham is Dath ilan does not want to be Keltham when it grows up

Hes not outcast Hes not prohibited from having children if that was even a thing outside of the Last Resort Keltham just has to fund those children himself if he wants them because dath ilan is not particularly trying to grow up to be him Or so they were very likely going to say to him on maturity despite Keltham having otherwise gotten 08SD on intelligence

And that was that and Keltham had made his own proud accommodations with it Because people are what they are and can only attain what they can in the course of being what they are better not by wishing they were somebody else Keltham spoke to a Confessor about his lifes master plans in case a Confessor had anything unexpected to say and the Confessor formally predicted to Keltham that if he had his 144 children and screwed all the elite desirable women who hang out with elite male public goods producers to mutually prove their respective eliteness Keltham would at the end still not feel happy Unless perhaps hed gotten to know a few of his children much better And Keltham had shrugged and said that then perhaps hed get to know a few children better But in terms of overall life ambitions Keltham cant think of anything with higher expected value to him for he feels the way he feels If hes not what dath ilan currently wants to be when it grows up then thats not who he is He can maybe prove to dath ilan that it was wrong about who Civilization needs in order to grow he cannot be other than what he is

But theres a god of there being potential for Good in everyone

Its a stupid thought Hes never going to do it And if he did modifying his own utility function to fit in is not quite provably incoherent because human beings are not starting out coherent but it is still not the Way as the Keepers would put it Keltham is what he is and needs to find his own way to be himself Dath ilan itself would tell him never to do that because it is horrifying self mutilation for the sake of conformity and that is also not what dath ilan wants to be when it grows up

So hes not going to pray to Sarenrae At all Considering that explicitly leads him to realize that he is horrified by the prospect of changing himself according to an external criterion and he knows that Keltham likewise already understands and acknowledges to himself that he would not even be doing this for his own sake It is just a stupid thought about how to fix something that somebody else said was not even wrong but not the thing they most ideally wanted to see It is perfectionism gone wrong to imagine that this aspect of himself of his own utility function might be fixed

Most of whats really going on probably is that some part of him is curious what it would feel like to be more centrally dath ilani just once and whether it would make him feel better in some way hes not seeing in advance Well above and beyond the pleasant sense of being more socially acceptable in principle But that wouldnt actually be the result that the real him feels something different temporarily it would be the temporary cessation and possibly the true suicide of the true Keltham beneath the manipulators of some inhuman thing

Asmodeus Abadar Norgorber Calistria Nethys Pentagram authority contracts pride banks and Osirion regulation violating and killing for money revenge and overturning of relative status knowledge and mad experimentation

 and before he tries any of those hes going to try to figure out who his own god would be the hypothetical god that would actually fit him and call out to that hypothetical being backed by explicit meditation on coherence theorems to make him more a kind of thing that gods can see Maybe theres a god like that

And if instead it calls in some entity thats new to Golarion hell know why they dont teach people here logical decision theory Heh

Even at the level of surface thoughts Kelthams mind moves from thought to thought in a way that is not within the variation of ordinary mortal minds on Golarion Kelthams thoughts are explicitly labeled as meta or object level His thoughts dont move in the frequent circles and loops that any telepath would be familiar with of mostly going over the same points and occasionally diverting from them in a new direction Any time Keltham thinks the same thought twice or at most three times he undergoes a reflexive wordless motion and focuses there and starts thinking words about why the thoughts are not quiescent after having already been spoken Occasionally Keltham thinks single syllable or two syllable words in Baseline that refer to mathematical concepts built on top of much larger bases fluidly integrated into his everyday experience

Everything inside Kelthams mind has a very trained feeling to it his moment to moment thought motions each feeling like a punch that a monk throws after twelve years of experience in martial arts when the monk isnt particularly focused on showing off and simply knows what hes doing without thinking about it When he is sad and upset Keltham goes into a reflexive motion of letting those parts of himself speak When he is uncertain and worried and doesnt know what to do next he weighs probabilities on his uncertainty and knows explicitly that his current worries are causing him to currently be trying to figure out what to do next Keltham is lost in a different world but it has been years since the last time he felt lost inside himself The present situation is not enough to induce that He has mostly forgotten what that feels like He has too many options for what to think next instead of feeling internally lost

Keltham is hardly perfect at any of the things hes been trained to do Often he does think the same thought three times in a row Frequently his current attempted cognitive tactic fails And Keltham notices the failure and undergoes a recovery tactic or moves on to the next thought all in motions so practiced that they dont distract him from the content of the thoughts themselves That meta stuff is all mostly the same from minute to minute so its been trained to the point of being ignored so long as its not breaking down

Carissa listens Sits at a table and writes everything down firstly because otherwise shes going to forget half of it and secondly because sitting at a table writing is a reasonable thing to do and hopefully wont alert him to being mindread When people arent used to being mindread their thoughts on being alerted to it are all about the fact of someone having access to their thoughts and while maybe he has the mental discipline to not do that if he chose he also might well choose it over having strategic thoughts where she could hear them

She wants to die

She has known for as long as she can remember that someday she will die and go to Hell and be trained out of her bad human habits free will nebulously defined and not the sort of thing you were supposed to ask a lot of clarifying questions about but its suddenly clear looking at his head free will is the tendency for the mind to wander away from its goals for the emotions to override thought processes instead of informing them for the brain to be sticky burst driven impulsive animalistic 

 it was not a correct parse of the situation to guess that Keltham doesnt have free will Hes imperfect at the thing hes been trained to do Hes more like someone raised from babyhood by Lawful outsiders or something He might have free will but hes never been around anyone who used it And hes nearly perfect she would not have guessed that a living person could be that could have that 

She has known that she would go to Hell and become perfect but she hasnt been impatient for it Shes impatient for it now 

 set that aside Theres a lot to do first

Theres another thing here which shes not going to unpack but it goes on the list of reasons to ask someone important if she thinks she has enough bargaining power which is that she has read a lot of minds and in general the meta process in all of them is directed at not thinking anything treasonous or thinking and then immediately rejecting and mentally apologizing for it His society is going for Lawful Good evidently but they seem to have not instilled that instinct he checks when his opinions are heretical to dath ilan but he isnt scared when they are perhaps because it sounds like dath ilan as a consequence probably of going for Lawful Good uses a very light touch on heresy though of course maybe Keltham wouldve vanished in the night and just doesnt know it perhaps his plane accident was in fact deliberate 

She reads his Intelligence at 18 maybe 19 Innately as smart as her or a bit smarter and not particularly notable for his society his society must be terrifying A tremendous asset to Asmodeus if He successfully claims them and well Keltham thought theyd side with Iomedae immediately instinctively just out of horror at the destruction of souls 

 she needs to start thinking about how to explain the thing where Hell hurts people without it seeming a conspicuous omission or an obvious dealbreaker if it ends up being decided that Keltham ought to know 

She is acutely aware of her own meta thoughts right now from all that poking at Kelthams and theyre scared because usually when she tries thinking about things like Hell hurting the correct thing to do is to steer her mind away not pressure test counterarguments 

 this is the kind of thing you ask a priest about

Its also the kind of thing where asking a priest gets you looked into as a potential dissident She should wait and see whether in fact someone with Greater Teleport shows up here tonight to take Keltham to a comfortable place if they do then she has the measure of safety that Keltham might ask about her and might be annoyed if shed been arrested and with higher likelihood annoyed if shed been executed and that they evidently value Keltham highly She doesnt know that yet so no thinking about that yet 

If Cheliax were more Keltham like would that serve Asmodeus It seems obviously so Kelthams world is rich and lawful and selecting for Good but not necessarily so you could do the same thing but prefer the tiny children who suspect a trap in the injured stranger and go off to their wonderful party or who dont even think of an injured stranger as a fact about the world that demands a response of any kind any more than people pluck worms off the cobblestones after a rain 

She sets that aside too and composes a second report for the priest and resists the urge to watch out of the corner of her eye while Keltham tries to make a god which shes pretty sure isnt how you make a god but well it wouldnt be the most ridiculous thing that had ever happened and it would necessitate some rapid changes of plans

If Keltham knew Carissas impression of his own thought processes he would give a sad wry half smile His half disciplined thought processes nearly perfect Hes some wild kid not a Keeper The Keepers would also laugh at the same thought theyre not superintelligences Superintelligences capable of laughter would laugh too theyre not unbounded What unbounded agents capable of laughter might laugh about is unknown but extrapolation says it would probably be something

And Keltham goes on thinking about the god of Keltham Well that and occasionally rehearsing some short term memories he needs to keep Asmodeus Abadar Norgorber Calistria Nethys Abadar runs the banks and Osirion Norgorber is about violating regulations and killing people for money Calistria does revenge and inversions of status Nethys knowledge and magic and mad experimentation

Keltham notices that he has now been thinking for a while about the proverbially difficult and crucial problem of Finding a Cofounder in the special case of finding a god is he still thinking about the right thing Should he be thinking about something else instead of this Like deciphering and abstractly reversing the specific way that Carissa was filtering his info if she was in fact doing that But Keltham may not realistically have enough info to figure out what Carissa could have hidden from him or even outright lied about he is too unfamiliar with this world Across whatever unknown distance it is not an epistemically safe stretch to presume even that just because Carissa is shaped like a human being she would like to have more money

There is the question of what really happened after the plane crash of why the whole impossible thing There is the challenge of decoding a whole new world that has not as yet been reduced into math nor into things that look like they should reduce to math But the tractability of that is unknown Whatever discoverable insights wait there could influence arbitrary decisions in arbitrary ways it is not safe to assume even that the parts he could figure out in an hour will not influence decisions in the next hour But there are not known missing insights like that

Right now Carissa thinks he should work with the Asmodean faction but Keltham has not yet talked to Asmodeus about the local equivalent of equity allocations that is a known open question Before talking to Asmodeus he might want to search on the god that fits Keltham in case the first god he meets tries to cleric him So thinking about that still seems like the schedule blocker This is what he should be thinking about

Enough meta scheduling on to the meta of figuring out how to figure out the god that fits Keltham

Carissa didnt mention any Chaotic Evil gods at all unless hes forgotten that part If Carissa is trying to hide things from him does that mean that Keltham should be searching for ideals that are more individualistic and selfish But theres too many different possibilities for what Carissa could be hiding he shouldnt stake a lot of time mind resource on hoping he got that guess right

Its tempting to approach the problem by asking which gods would be most helpful for his Golarion industrialization project or which gods would give him the largest equity allocations if thats how Good works it probably doesnt But on reflection looking for the most exploitable god may be the wrong idea on a deep level if other things Carissa said werent false To become a cleric of a god he needs a god that resonates with something deep inside him preferably something that would make him feel good about working with a smarter person who had the same feature Some goal that Keltham shares some ideal that Keltham holds the god that tries to make a world into which Keltham would fit in a way that he never fit into dath ilan obviously Keltham wished dath ilan had been more individualized Chaotic and had more room for non unselfish good Evil But the feature needs to be more specific than that gods are not just alignments 

Does he already know what his god looks like Before doing a lot of setup work on a problem you should check to make sure you dont already know the answer

Keltham doesnt think he already knows A few seconds of direct soul searching doesnt solve it But in terms of how to productively think for longer this seems related to the writing exercise for Environmentalized Intrinsics doesnt it Hes never actually gone through that exercise but he has heard of the concept in detail via sheer memetic contamination at gatherings he has ever attended Doing that exercise seems like it might also turn up the features of the god who matches Keltham

Theres a metafictional trope in dath ilan which is popular to the point that even Keltham who is not an especially avid consumer or producer of fiction knows all about it Its the kind of trope where people talk about their own takes on it on outings romantic or friendly even if they write relatively little fiction themselves

The Baseline phrase for this trope is a polysyllabic monstrosity that would literally translate as Intrinsic Characteristic Boundary Edge A translation that literal would be misleading the second word pair of Boundary Edge is glued together in the particular way that indicates a tuple of words has taken on a meaning that isnt a direct sum of the original components A slight lilt or click of spoken Baseline a common punctuation marker in written Baseline

When the words Boundary Edge are glued together into a special term what theyve come to mean by processes of mere convention rather than explicit decision a form of linguistic drift that happens even in dath ilan is Cartesian Environment the Environment as falsely distinguished from the Agent by a boundary an edge which does not ultimately exist within the territory

This glued term for Cartesian Environment has in turn been double glued the max recursion depth being three of course with Intrinsic Characteristic to take on the new meaning externalization of the inward selfs innate distinguishing characteristics into a world the Environmentalized Intrinsic or Environmentalized Self

This trope began as a novel about people who could externalize themselves into pocket worlds which became popular enough to pick up vast amounts of secondary and tertiary literature as this concept was further explored As it turned out a lot of early career phase secondary literature authors were quite interested in the question of what worlds are inside characters it is also apt for artistry and memeing

And when the original author decided the original series was over the conversation about the trope began again more seriously and up a meta level As the original author revealed afterwards the Environmentalized Self was meant not just as a metaphor but a productive metaphor for writing in general and worldbuilding in particular The question What is within myself that can be externalized into a world is a place to begin when an author takes the step from secondary fiction to primary fiction and starts making a world of their own

Say that you yourself have always wanted all of the houses to look like glowing crystals instead of as is more commonly the convention in dath ilan old stone covered in plants Then making a world out of that piece of yourself is likely to have an authenticity to it which does not appear when you are only trying to throw in random variations to make your world be Different Some part of you knows why houses have to be glowing crystals some part of you knows what kind of glowing crystals they should be Or maybe its not so much that you want glowing crystal houses but that they fit better with you or that you know in your heart of hearts that if the world was made out of you the houses would end up made of glowing crystal whether you liked that truth or not

It is a facile and not quite right proverb to say that characters are made of authors or that characters are made out of carefully selected pieces of author You can write a character who has some feature that is not drawn from yourself at all its just harder It requires you to have a theoretical understanding of a psychology you do not yourself possess strong enough to ring deeply true to anyone who does have that psychology It is easier to draw deep on the well of craft when you are writing a character who is enough like you that the thoughts they think seem to you not just reasonable or defensible but like thoughts you almost thought yourself in a closely neighboring reality The further you go from that the more likely you are to stumble and turn the character into a distant Other who is not really animated by an inward spark that reflects and optimizes the same way you do the more likely you are to stumble and try to construct something alien to yourself based on a psychological theory that is false

Universes can be made in part out of memories of your true world including the parts of the outer world that you wouldnt have made yourself and that dont fit well with you But built worlds can also be made out of you and thats why the Environmentalized Self trope spread as rapidly among authors as it did To the extent a world is made neither out of true world experience nor out of yourself you are making it out of explicit theories about alien worlds drawn from neither memory nor the wells of self This is possible but harder it can stumble in the same way as trying to write a character based on a psychological theory of the Other

After proposing that the World of You has glowing crystal houses of course comes the real work of worldbuilding To depict a realistic world with houses of glowing crystal you must understand the causes that lead the current world to have houses that look like old stone covered in plants and you must postulate those causes to be different and their own ancestral causes to be different too You have to ask the question of how a world found its equilibrium in the You place where the real worlds equilibrium was different Unavoidably you must now go to the other deep well inside you the deep well of theory your knowledge and understanding of counterfactuals why the world is the way it is how it could have ended up differently given different inputs or different parameters And so the real meat of worldbuilding as with so many other things tests ones explicit understanding of economics

The level 1 beginners form of this exercise the form that early authors do to practice starting out and the conversation that gets made at unserious parties is the exercise How would the world be different if everyone was like you or Suppose a worlds median was around yourself in all dimensions or What is the world from which you were an average random draw or What is the history and present state of a world which in mostly equilibrium ended up with its medians mostly around where you are or What world with a history spits you out as a very typical person in all respects instead of the very atypical person in many respects that you are in real life

If the harsh truth is that youve always thought the obsession with the exteriors of houses is silly when their interiors are what counts and therefore in your world buildings look like exposed metal and concrete if the cities are less pretty as seen from outside in the world that is the externalization of your interior then you are faced with a test of self honesty You can either admit the houses arent as pretty because your utility function wouldnt really care enough to spend a lot of money on that if the World of Yous had never seen normal dath ilan for comparison to feel competitive about that Or you can fail the self honesty test and end up trying to worldbuild a world that is not made out of the true piece of yourself because you were not able to be honest with yourself about who you were

Conversely of course if you claim that the World of You has a substantially higher per capita GDP while otherwise having the same physics and biology as dath ilan youre going to face a lot of skepticism about that one By market efficiency your soul is unlikely to contain a realistic economic policy that yields better results than the policies spotlighted by counterfactual conditional prediction markets But that is a very obvious trap that any dath ilani sees as soon as they contemplate the exercise even if they werent explicitly warned against it

So you look within yourself for possible features of a world that would be or reflect you then you do further worldbuilding on that worlds history to explain how it got that way and ended up in that mostly stable equilibrium then you write a few stories set there to shake out the world to make it more consistent as you are forced to visualize it fully and make sure your axioms have a model And then you have something to compare and contrast to your friends own Intrinsic Environment worlds at parties

All this is the long background story behind why when Keltham asks himself what god and domain would fit Keltham and be clericable for him and doesnt immediately come up with an answer for that he already knows an exact complicated thought process he can try to use to find an answer Similarly if one asks why Keltham is able to go through this thought process without much in the way of blind alleys and without falling into obvious pitfalls despite his young age like self flattery or blaming everything wrong with the world on other people not being as well intentioned as himself part of the answer is that Keltham has heard secondhand repeated advice from famous authors on how to do this writing exercise correctly and without falling into common pitfalls

It is also why in trying to do all this it will not occur to Keltham that in searching for his own true god and world he is asking a Question about Himself that is such a Big Serious Question that it ought to take longer than ten half minutes to figure out Its a worldbuilding trope People do it live at parties

How much room does Keltham have here to godbuild worldbuild Is he searching for one key feature of himself or a collection of them Gods can do more than one thing if theyre related things Asmodeus has related thingies for contracts authority pride is called Executive of Law Keltham may not need to squeeze the god address down to one characteristic of himself no thats the wrong way to think about it Even if he can call beyond the locally known universe there is no guarantee that gods are dense in characteristics Its probably better to find one idea or aesthetic that defines the god that Keltham would want to partner with In any case the correct search ordering is to begin with the most important requirement after that he can see if theres room or need for anything else

 Keltham notices that he has spent an awful lot of time on meta His mind is probably flinching away from this Why

 the same reason he never did the Environmentalized Intrinsic exercise in the first place The incredibly obvious thought is what if instead of there being a few more people like you in the next generation if you succeed rather dath ilan had been composed of people like you to begin with And that is painful it is should ing if you are actually stuck in dath ilan There was no reason to think about things that way to contrast reality to its alternative and make himself sad Now he actually needs to solve this question for other reasons in real life and needs to just go ahead with it

What is the Kelthamverse like

Does the Kelthamverse have higher GDP Hes going to think that just to get it over with First order no Okay fine in the details if you literally do the version what is the world in mostly equilibrium from which somebody like you is a median random draw then the Kelthamverse has 08SD g over dath ilan and therefore a higher GDP But by convention you are to ignore that because re extrapolating a world with higher intelligence or rationality is impossible for known reasons youd have to predict the effects of the actions of more extreme geniuses than any geniuses than exist in your current world Or maybe Kelthamians care more about higher GDP compared to other considerations relative to the average dath ilani and the policy prediction markets results are weighted accordingly But mostly there is no obvious reason the Kelthamverse has higher GDP in virtue of the people inside it caring less selflessly

Is a Keltham even happier in the Kelthamverse Would he actually feel more like he belonged if hed grown up there and never seen dath ilan for comparison Maybe a Keltham is a person who needs to feel unbelonging over something and his neurotype would find some other oddity of himself to obsess over instead Maybe everybody in the Kelthamverse feels like an outsider there based on their own personal least socially acceptable random variable

Keltham recognizes a thought of undue self uncharity whispering in its way under the guise of counteracting some bias you might have and sets it aside His self model does not actually say this is how a Keltham works and that is that He has been taught to distrust himself a little not infinitely No more distrust than he has earned from himself under his own accounts of his history the alternative is a kind of inescapable madness and helplessness and hes not into that

Does the Kelthamverse have fewer public goods because in fact the Kelthamians do not care quite as much Because those who become rich find better paths to romantic success than producing public goods since that is the pathway that dath ilan laid out for rich people to be romantically more successful and the Kelthamverse would not have laid out the same path Kelthams brain immediately wants to shout back that the Kelthamians would find their own way to produce the public goods that were actually needed just as well as dath ilan But this seems not necessarily true especially if the Kelthamians never saw dath ilan and never felt competitive about doing at least that well

The fact that Keltham can no longer actually call a Confessor is no excuse for his not doing the same mental operation of betting on what a Confessor would tell him just never again rolling an electronic d144 and actually phoning a Confessor if the die comes up 0 to keep himself honest Would a Confessor told this scenario formally predict to Keltham that a Keltham would be unhappier in the Kelthamverse Because he has been in some sense free riding on the nice environment that was created by those dath ilani whose outrage at Abaddon would be enough to make them clerics of Iomedae

Theres a common wisdom in dath ilan that even after spending 3 of GDP on generalized coordination enforcement most of what makes a high tech society like dath ilan actually work is that the people inside it have truly altruistic components of their utility function That most people are not just being cooperative for instrumental reasons That most people wont commit crimes even when theyre pretty sure they wont get caught The number of tiny opportunities for defecting and getting away with it every day is just too large to make it work if people dont actually care about other people Dath ilan is much closer to the multi agent optimal boundary than it would be in the world with the same institutions but genuinely actually selfish people The crime reporting mechanisms are built for a world in which most people will take a minute to call the police if they see a violent stabbing in progress and you dont have to pay people 5 to do that and then worry that theyll set up violent stabbings to earn 5 The system is built to be resilient against rogue psychopaths not against everybody being a psychopath The police architecture is set up on the assumption that it might need to catch an individual bad police officer not on the assumption that police collectively would just take your stuff as soon as they thought they could get away with keeping it

If a high tech world could be put together out of entirely selfish people at all it would probably require much more spending on explicit coordination to set up a system that could stably run factories without them just being looted by every employee simultaneously plus any police who showed up Who even puts in the work to build the whole coordination structure in the first place if theyre not motivated by the good of Civilization Maybe perfectly selfish beings who were more coherent and crystalline in their thoughts would find their way to a multi agent optimal boundary kept in place by institutional structures ruling out defection at every point None of the crystalline minds would need to altruistically spend the time to negotiate institutions into existence because all the crystalline minds would see the possibility simultaneously and choose it at the same time Beings like humans but who didnt care at all about others welfare wouldnt do that they would not end up with factories just roving individuals looting each other So says the common wisdom of dath ilan

Keltham was in fact honestly shaken when he heard that the Neutral Evil afterlife was eating souls Hed always questioned that common wisdom in the back of his mind But but apparently not Apparently if youre not explicitly Lawful or explicitly Chaotic if you dont care about social structures either way then whats left is simply Selfishness the way it might be materialized in an alien or a construct

The sense in which actually all of society working depends on people being altruistic because the incentives just arent that perfect and otherwise the whole structure of dath ilan would fall apart almost instantly thats part of the justification that dath ilan could give if Keltham tried to explicitly argue with it for why heritage optimization should try to preserve explicit altruism in the utility function Its a reason dath ilan might give for why Keltham shouldnt have subsidized childcare unless occasional people like him are valuable enough to society that he can pay for the childcare himself

So yeah The Neutral Evil beings just eating souls yeah that shook him Because if thats where being a little more selfish leads in the end then dath ilan is right

But maybe thats still the voice of too little self charity

Asmodeus Abadar Norgorber Calistria Nethys

Keltham did not abandon that lightly injured person that he passed upon the sidewalk even as a child with his own frontal cortex less than fully formed He wanted to be repaid since the other person was capable of repaying him but he didnt abandon them A bird once flew into a window right in front of Keltham when he was a child and fell to the ground and didnt move and he ran off crying to find his father He didnt think about whether the bird could pay him back because it obviously couldnt If Keltham came across an injured child now with a lot less money than himself well hed help but hed feel a lot better about a world in which that Civilization would repay him and not give him any second stupid glances about his having insisted on payment because why is this child his problem in particular But Keltham wouldnt ask the child to repay And hed cheerfully pay a proportional amount into public good funds to repay other people who helped children when it wasnt particularly their job

Hes not a bad person not by his own standards And if he was he could choose to do things differently and meet his own standards If hes not completely incoherent under reflection he ought to be able to reach into himself and imagine the world thats nice according to his own notions of niceness

The writing exercise for the Environmentalized Self is allowed to include ideals inside you hopes inside you not just realities inside you The point of the writing exercise is that the feature is inside you so some part of yourself knows how the feature should work and it is not just an oddity added out of a vague wish to make your writing different This isnt that writing exercise but for purposes of calling the right god nearby ideals may also be the way to go if they are Kelthams own idealizations that the real Keltham could at least come close to attaining on his own

So the Kelthamians of the Kelthamverse are not selfish not the way that whatever eats souls in Abaddon must be really actually selfish Keltham doesnt think that he himself is flawed in that way He does not think he is actually just plain selfish and picked up the rest through acculturation in dath ilan And even if hes wrong and the real Keltham isnt that nice fine so what he is envisioning a universe in which he is not exactly the median sue him

The Kelthamians of the Kelthamverse Keltham decides do not have to go to fantastic lengths to enforce and punish and pay for coordination they are not in a world where nobody actually cares about anybody else or has any honor Kelthamians keep their promises always whether or not anyone is watching Kelthamians dont betray their business partners whether or not anyone is watching They dont qualify as Good by Golarions bizarre standards because they are perfectly aware of how a positive reputation benefits them and they are ready to exploit that and would be very snippy about not getting their due for it But they would also keep their promises in the dark even if nobody ever knew Keltham thinks that is actually true of himself and even if he is wrong and flatters himself too much the corresponding god would be one he could work with It is one of his ideals and one that would be very close to him even if in fact he doesnt have it already

And its not the part Keltham needs to be thinking about but hes going to think about it anyways just to get it out of the way of the rest it is actually true it is not just him trying to stick it to dath ilan in his mind it is actually true that a neurotypical dath ilani would feel less outside and alone in the Kelthamverse than Keltham felt in dath ilan Because nobody in the Kelthamverse thinks its a problem if youre more altruistic than the rest of the Kelthamverse so long as you still keep your business promises and dont murder people even in the dark in all the forms of honor that keep Kelthamverse society running and coordinated They dont withdraw public support for your childrens childcare if youre nicer than other people The Kelthamverse doesnt want to be dath ilan when it grows up but its fine with there being dath ilani inside it in the Future

The Kelthamverse has more of an expectation that people fund childcare individually or through individual philanthropy in the first place they have much less of a collective Future optimization thing going on The Kelthamverse doesnt have voter aggregates deciding on heritage optimization criteria for policy prediction markets resolving 20 and 50 and 100 years out Theyre leaving it up to individuals and philanthropists and just checking the prediction markets to make sure that the default course isnt predicted to end up with huge probabilities of anything awful so long as the prediction markets dont predict catastrophe theyre fine letting the larger world go its own way

Maybe a dath ilani will feel sad that the entire world isnt as altruistic as they are that only 5 of the population feels the same strength of feeling about the true deaths of strangers as themselves But if so the Kelthamians wont feel too sad for them because a Kelthamian doesnt think you have the right to expect all of Civilization to think the same way you do Keltham didnt complain about Civilization being of a different mind than himself because he had no right to demand that of strangers he just set out to test himself and prove Civilization wrong if he could

So thats the first defining quality of the Kelthamverse In one sense yes people care differently and less about each other when they help they do so much more in expectation that somebody will repay them even if theyre helping a child But the Kelthamians still help children and pay into the public funds to pay off other people who help children they do have the sense that somebody ought to be doing that And the Kelthamians still have all the emotions about intrinsically caring about coordination the emotions that are shards of the higher structure for Coordination and shadows of the one irreplaceable logical copy of the Algorithm Kelthamians keep their promises even in the dark when nobody will ever find out They arent first to betray their business partners their mates their friends and not because they are calculating the value of their reputation but because that isnt who they are They would pay their debts even absent any legal enforcement for debts the vast majority of them under the vast majority of circumstances and so they dont have to pay more of their GDP for coordination enforcement than dath ilan

If a Kelthamian sells you something it does exactly what it says on the label and disclosed all the facts you needed to know In fact if the Kelthamverse is literally all exact copies of himself not a distribution from which he is the median draw then advertisements are more trustworthy than in dath ilan because when everybody is exactly Keltham there is no variation in trustworthiness so there is no adverse selection favoring producers who got ahead by being a little less trustworthy in ways they couldnt be caught And the GDP is actually slightly higher Though theyd also better get cracking on biotech really fast because reproduction

If theres a god of doing really honest business in both business and friendship with personal and commercial advertisements true in letter and spirit all debts repaid whether monetary or informal all promises kept without exception never the first to defect even in the dark even if reality is ending the next day and theres no more iterations of the dilemmas where its also perfectly socially acceptable to be nice because youre not hurting anyone by doing that but you dont just demand people be nice to lightly injured strangers then look oddly at them when they want personal or public reimbursement a god whose thingy is a little more selfish than dath ilans in one sense but unselfishly utility function desiring the shards of higher Coordination in some more coherent but still ultimately bounded version of how humans have honor and never defacing the Algorithm then Keltham could see himself working with that god on the Golarion industrialization project Maybe even being its cleric depending on the benefits

That Keltham thinks is the true meaning of Chaos if theres a Chaotic Evil god like that

Asmodeus Abadar Norgorber Calistria Nethys

There is not a Chaotic Evil god like that because Keltham was somewhat misinformed about Chaos and also about Evil 

There is as it happens a god like that

Among the many disadvantages of shattered prophecy is that sometimes strange attention demanding things happen which are unscheduled

The situation of a god on the planes could be compared to a titan with a hundred thousand eyes standing atop a mountain gazing down at a dozen surrounding countries each filled with a billion squirrels Even as a titan You cannot think about all the squirrels individually You can at best set a fraction of Your attention to watching for predefined signals that You have trained the squirrels to use The squirrels cannot understand the coordinates to align their eyes across many dimensions to look at You But You can give them a word like Abadar and a holy symbol and say a few words about why banks need to exist and then notice when a squirrel looks in that direction not quite at You but more in Your direction than the other titans atop their own mountains

One day a fraction of Your attention notices a squirrel looking in one set of subdimensions along an angle that would be aligned almost exactly on the real You if the squirrel could get the other dimensions right too Its surprising because You have never seen a squirrel look in that direction before You have wished You could explain it to squirrels but prediction always showed their heads exploding when You tried that so You didnt try it

Then the squirrel thinks for a bit and turns its head into another dimension and looks almost right at the correct angle in that dimension too

The squirrel pauses visibly to a god staring inside itself and deducing further conclusions from premises and then angles its head and looks almost directly at Your angle in yet another dimension

If the power disparities were not what they were the squirrels behavior might be considered reminiscent of a stalking predator the more humanlike and sadistic kind of monster who is deliberately crouching down to look under the dresser standing up and then crouching down again only to look under the desk and the stalker knows all along that you are actually under the bed You are not frightened under the circumstances where the circumstances are that You are a god but You are definitely noticing

Then the squirrel gathers itself angles its viewpoint 

 and turns to stare almost directly at You including some mathy parts that nobody in Axis is allowed by treaty to explain to anybody who might go back to Golarion

You wait for the squirrel to pray to You to make one of the appeals which You are allowed by treaty to respond to without that being incredibly expensive so You can very softly and carefully so it doesnt explode ask the squirrel what the Abyss is going on and how a squirrel even got this address

The squirrel thinks loudly about how it might not mind being Your cleric but doesnt actually ask

Then the squirrel looks at five gods one after another in the stories for mortals coordinates one of which is the standard wrong address for You

Then the squirrel goes back to thinking

Also the squirrels body is in an Asmodean church near the Worldwound its mind looks like a teenaged male raised by modrons and its immaterial soul is ninety three minutes old

You would have more attention to pay this sort of anomaly if the surprise had been properly scheduled like in the other worlds you deal with

Entities with very high Intelligence dont make quite the same kind of comical mistakes that humans do They know what they dont know they pick up on alternate hypotheses and incongruent facts very early on They still make comical mistakes to be clear as seen from their own perspectives but different ones

Why is the mortal thinking loudly about being a cleric but not actually asking Abadar doesnt know but He knows that He doesnt know Among the possibilities is that the mortal who is in an Asmodean church is in a life position where suddenly becoming a cleric of Abadar would be inconvenient due to the Asmodean reaction to it This is only one hypothesis among several Abadar does not leap to the conclusion It is not even certain that the mortal was deliberately choosing not to immediately pray for clerichood or that the mortal knew that Abadar was watching and might otherwise have responded That is only one hypothesis group among several

But it is a large enough strategic equivalence class of hypotheses that Abadar is not dropping cleric levels on the mortal right away in case the mortal definitely didnt want that and was trying to signal so

Could the five gods in the sequence be a deliberate message The tiny fraction of Abadars attention that He can spare does consider some possibilities like that it would be stupid in a sense not to think of them at all Asmodeus Abadar Norgorber Calistria Nethys could be interpreted as tyrant Abadar murder revenge magic and be an attempted message that somebody was about to assassinate the prince of Osirion vengefully using magic This comical misinterpretation does not actually happen because if the mortal had wanted to send a message to Abadar its posture would have changed in a way Abadar could detect its part of the posture of treaty defined prayer

But something strange is clearly happening And it would be a huge wasted opportunity if this mortal ended up being squished by Asmodeans before it could at least tell other mortals some things that Abadar hasnt been allowed to explain directly

But if Abadar calls up Asmodeus and offers to buy the avoidance of squishing this particular squirrel might that not call the attention of Asmodeus down upon this squirrel in exactly the way that the squirrel might on some hypotheses have been trying to avoid by deliberately not asking Abadar for clerichood

If one were a mortal one might perhaps reason that there is nothing to be done here But Asmodeus is a Lawful god and does not generally prefer accidentally stepping on Abadars goals over being paid to avoid stepping on Abadars goals It would be in some sense silly if Abadar and Asmodeus had no possible coordinated strategy better than Asmodeuss church accidentally squishing a valuable squirrel because Abadar was afraid to talk to Asmodeus about that They would be noticeably off the Pareto optimal boundary

Abadar sends a brief packet to Asmodeus which might translate as

Hey Asmodeus I want to reveal information relevant to negotiating a potential gainful trade where that information itself might otherwise worsen my negotiating position for the trade on the standard condition that you promise not to use that information to implement strategies that lead to worse outcomes than would have obtained in the counterfactual where I stayed silent as evaluated by either my utility function or by the best guess probable utility function of another party who revealed that information to me

Acknowledged agreed to

Humans trying to make a similar arrangement might be relying on reputation the last thousand times we did this he kept his end or character he seems like the sort of person whod keep his word or consequences breaking his word would be punished or the prospects of future cooperation if he betrays the agreement this time we wont be able to do this in future which would be a loss to him Gods can just make parts of them legible to one another and promise with those Asmodeus is in part keeping of agreements and if all of those sources of motivation suddenly failed to obtain there would still be the agreement itself in no sense weakened Not everything about Him is knowable not even to other gods but this is

Some humans understand this in part and think that it means Asmodeus can be outwitted if He gives His word unwisely after all He will keep it and if you cleverly trap Him into promising you wealth and power or the right to reign in Hell or anything else He would follow through This is true but if you think youve found an opportunity to do it you havent

Asmodeus is curious but only slightly most of His attention is in other places doing other things

A mortal has had an unshared insight into Abadars domain This mortal is probably but not definitely under the power of or threatenable by Asmodeus Cheliax the Asmodean church Abadar wants to pay to modify future events so that the mortal doesnt end up dead and soul trapped maledicted in a way that prevents Osirians from resurrecting it nor spending nearly all of its natural lifespan in Cheliax or prison never talking extensively with Abadars followers nor tortured by Asmodeans into not being in an Abadaran shape nor traumatized eg by having all of its friends and family tortured to the point where itd no longer be an inspiring teacher if Abadar Osirion paid it to do that Abadar doesnt need to explicitly list brain damage and mindwipes as also undesirable He mainly sends a specification over ultimate consequences

Abadar honestly discloses that this mortal may or may not be opposing some ongoing Asmodean plan as mortals sometimes end up doing Abadar doesnt know this but has seen 18 bits of evidence over the prior If so Abadar is not offering to pay for letting the mortal have free reign to oppose Asmodeus unopposed or anything that expensive He just wants to pay for having the mortal delivered to Osirion afterwards instead of squished Abadar did however find all this out through what seemed like a voluntary high trust action of revelation from the mortal So information from this negotiation itself especially that the mortal might have plans opposing Asmodeans must not be used to further Asmodeuss interests at the mortals expense if Abadar points out the mortal to Asmodeus That Asmodeus should not eg try to falsely depict Abadar as having betrayed the mortal to Him follows automatically from the previous goal spec

Abadar mainly predicts this would cost Asmodeus one revelation to Asmodeans via priest or devil whatever marginal value Asmodeus could otherwise get by torturing one mortal instead of coaxing it possibly it being marginally harder to oppose the mortals opposition to some unknown plan and attention cost of thought

If Asmodeus has a price on that agreeable to Abadar Abadar can give distinguishing characteristics for the mortal in question

Its a marginally more complicated negotiation than say Iomedae would demand with Iomedae Abadar would just offer to pay for some utility since She knows Abadars utility function Indeed Iomedae could just ask for fair reimbursement afterwards Hes Lawful Shes Lawful Asmodeus has stated a preference for fully specified contracts with advance agreed payments based on expected values instead of actual values and the thing where parties retain some private information while trying to guess how much private information the other party has It tends to favor the party with higher Intelligence in negotiations but Asmodeus apparently still does it even when the other party realizes that and adjusts prices accordingly He just likes contracts Abadar is happy enough to go along with it in cases like this one where that reduces Abadars payments variance across counterfactuals

Asmodeus considers this A human would be tempted to try to identify the mortal based on the information provided and it happens that in this case that would probably be possible but Asmodeus does not do that it would be resource intensive and He is committed to not using the information and He is not in the habit of acquiring information He cant use

He names a price

Sold Its this mortal in an Asmodean church at the Worldwound You cant miss it its the incredibly odd one

 huh that is an odd one Does Abadar happen to know why its adult shaped but apparently a newborn baby Hes not willing to pay much for that information but it seems of mutual interest if there were a way to make adult shaped humans without the expensive baby stage

The cleric praying to Asmodeus in that church gets a vision

Abadar has no clue lit plenty of hypotheses and no evidence who this mortal is or what is going on but it sure does look Lawful It is possible that some glitch has occurred and that this represents a profit opportunity for Law

The priest stands up shaking Waves Carissa over Theres a scroll of Sending in a locked box in the back room heres the key Bring it back

Shes not going to ask what happened its none of her business She goes and gets it 

Urgently with direct input from Asmodeus requesting seventh circle pickup at the Worldwound pursuant to earlier communications more info on arrival

Should I pack

Hmmm Your notes leave your spare uniform Dont interact with him further until Ive briefed you absolutely dont enchant him

There is something heady terrifying validating about knowing Asmodeus has involved Himself He sees it too she thinks even though thats absurdly prideful to imagine theyre seeing the same things at all to imagine seeing is a good word to cover the both of them She goes and packs

Kelthams current plan is to try reaching out to the Intrinsic of Keltham god followed by Asmodeus if that doesnt work as soon as he has the quiet and privacy to compose himself and try to arrange his thoughts into the most coherently shaped patterns he can manage in order to maximize the apparently slight chance that he can successfully contact a god It may be in some sense unreasonable to hope that its that simple but probably some things will be simple for him given his unusual knowledge base Its worth trying the obvious tactic before trying any less obvious ones just so that he doesnt accidentally overcomplicate his own life and waste a lot of effort on difficult strategies that arent actually necessary

Asmodeus Abadar Norgorber Calistria Nethys

Next maybe spend some time trying to figure out What Happened and What It Implies About the Ontology of Greater Reality No next stand up and stretch a bit Youre supposed to stand up and stretch every so often while thinking

Keltham tries to do that and nearly falls over He ran headlong towards smoke in freezing cold longer and faster than he usually runs through freezing cold every day Ouch

The priest raises an eyebrow at him and offers him a drink

Ah yes water Keltham has heard of this Its what sane people ingest after heavy exercise A little beneath the dignity of someone who calls himself a Mad Investor but under the circumstances Keltham will lower himself to briefly act like a sane person

If they could communicate he could offer other drinks but they cant

If they could communicate Keltham could be puzzled by what was on offer and why anybody would possibly want to drink it but they cant

A few minutes later a person materializes in thin air and the priest rushes over to talk to them 

That is so incredibly cool The logistics this civilization must have no wait all this stuff is incredibly expensive isnt it

It should be cheaper That is just Kelthams personal opinion but it is already a strongly held one Depending on how much math nobody here knows he should have a look at the magic business too not just steel

Its a long conversation and after a couple of minutes they leave to have it in privacy They go into a room and an odd thick fog immediately seeps out of it ringing the room in a perfectly smooth radius

Keltham already wants him some of that and doesnt want it any more for seeing much less impressive applications Though are they trying to hide the discussions from him actually no that doesnt make much sense he doesnt have the local language They could discuss in front of him how to take all his stocks and eat his soul and he wouldnt know any better

Carissa comes back a couple of minutes later sees the fog looks pleased about it 

And after a few more minutes the teleporting guy comes out of the fog room and says in Baseline Im Fertinan Cortess senior summoner at the Academae in Korvosa The Worldwound is periodically swarmed by demons and has very few people with whom you could collaborate on inventing steel so we want to invite you to come to Ostenso a large port city in Cheliax which we think will be a better place for this project You have my word that I expect you to be safer more comfortable better resourced and more able to pursue the goals youve told us of in Ostenso than here and that if you hate it its possible in Ostenso to pay for passage back here or elsewhere Does that sound all right

So it sounds like you were warned that Im new to this world but maybe not about the degree to which my own world is incredibly different from this one Am I right about that

The local priest directly got a vision from Asmodeus about it which sort of sets a very high lower bound on how important it must be Theyre not saying that though The wizard who mindread him thinks that his world has successfully figured out how to raise humans who can almost completely compensate for having free will and think like outsiders Theyre not saying that either though 

The right tack here is humility I havent actually met people from any other worlds and I would not have trouble believing I am underestimating how different yours is

Until this person spoke it had not occurred to Keltham that going to some place might mean that he could not from that place go to other places and the fact that somebody thinks he might need to be reassured about that is not reassuring It brings a lot of other things into question too many things in fact

Let me put it this way From my perspective what you said implied a lot of facts entirely new to me like implicitly it might not be good to trust somebody who said Id be better resourced in Cheliax unless they added you have my word and then you think I ought to trust that You expect me to worry that if I go to Ostenso I might not be able to get passage back but you dont expect me to worry that tickets would be too expensive that I couldnt find other work or that Cheliaxs equivalent of Governance wouldnt order everyone who sells transportation to not sell me a ticket Theres this particular implied range of attempted defections against a prospective business partner which you think I should worry about and which youre trying to reassure me about but that range itself is less the word that translates in my language as Lawful compared to my world And right now I have not observed enough facts about this world to establish basic causal entanglement between this reality and my mind when I wonder whether your statements are true I have to wonder whether any place called Cheliax exists not whether youre saying something false about Cheliax To the extent I have to worry about deception like that I also have to worry that you would still be planning to defect even if you said you gave your word because I havent observed whatever system of incentives here makes people trustworthy when they give their words

My uncertainty is so wide in fact that I havent thought of anything I can pragmatically do about it I mean I could try to talk to the giant six legged things inside the bubble and ask them if theyre actually demons bent on destroying the world but that doesnt actually seem smart because its potentially dangerous and a narrow shot inside a very wide space So yes fine lets go to Ostenso under the understanding that I am a prospective business partner trying to cooperate with Asmodeus and your general treatment of me reflects on his reputation for reciprocating attempted cooperation because the very smart very Lawful entity should be an anchor of sanity and good coordination if anything is at least assuming that such any such entity as Asmodeus or gods in general exist And then I request a translation spell and a library visit so I can read a lot of random pages in random books and start to infer back the world those pages were written in

The man thinks about this for about ten seconds like its in fact a lot of new information about something 

 deal he says And then something over his shoulder to Carissa

Who understood none of that and has only half a guess at the flavor Yes Im coming She takes Cortesss arm

Deal Were still operating informally under a presumption of good intentions and general attempts to repay good deeds later or at least I hope we are Actual proper deals should be written down for ontological stability Keltham tentatively offers a hand in case anybody wants a hand for magical reasons which looks like it might be the case

I dont mean that Im holding you to precisely what you just said the man says But sure informally under a presumption of good intentions

And they teleport

Theyre in the summer villa of the Archduke Henderthane of Sirmium requisitioned five minutes ago in a very rushed conversation with the Queens personal pit fiend Its on eighteen hundred acres the house itself at the peak of the cliffs looking out across the Inner Sea All the prettiest girls at the local wizard school have been dragged over and set loose in the library 

The society that made this was poor but the person who made this was rich labor was cheap for him and its very beautiful stonework 

Okay this place is pretty Maybe this universe isnt as much of a dump as it looked from the Worldwound Keltham will probably spend a minute or two appreciating all beautiful sights in sight especially any that dont have dath ilani counterparts unless somebody attempts to talk to him

No one can talk to him until the seventh circle wizard prepares and casts Share Language in any event which takes him about ten minutes he sits down on the nearest bench and his fingers twitch in the air as if tracking something very complicated Carissa watches raptly 

And then he puts his hand on Kelthams shoulder and Keltham speaks Taldane 

Speaking a language suddenly is fairly distracting all the words you know now map to the nearest available other words in the other language which is not at all how people learn languages when they learn them It has been analogized to getting onto an alligator and learning that it rides exactly like the pony you grew up riding on but this might not be a helpful analogy if you havent ridden any ponies or alligators 

There should be a library indoors I dont know where exactly but the staff will says the wizard 

I know Taldane Relative to prior expectations this is so much higher in my preference ordering than wait what 

Oh my ass Prior probability distribution is how many syllables Relative to the objective targets for which Baseline was optimized this language was not optimized along the 

Keltham stops concentrates discards several false starts on Taldane sentences that balloon far out of control

This language isnt good at doing some things my world thinks a language should be good at At some later point you should try giving somebody else my language and test whether that makes them think better

Share Language only shares ones I know Possibly you should pick up wizardry this spells only two syllable word for the complexity of the spell relative to other spells conveying its topology and the fact that the better half of wizards could cast it and that it uses about 16 as much energy as a basic teleport

Yeah that was definitely on my ordered list on my list of things to try I reciprocate for your game theoretic oh my ass does this language really not have a less than ten syllable way just to say thank you there it is Thank you for your helpful help which I do understand to have been offered in a spirit of intended mutual future profit and not just friendship

Theres a polite dath ilani thing to say when youre thanking somebody and youre not sure how much of their help was pure altruism or not but if he tries to say that thing itll take eight thousand syllables and then the other person still wont know how to interpret it colloquially

The wizard reminds himself of the thing hes been reminding himself of for the last eleven minutes which is that this is an alien and even if they look deceptively human they dont think that way 

He nods Youre welcome The spell expires every day Since its only second circle Sevar can cast it for you when it needs refreshing People find that after a couple months of it they usually just know the new language even without a spell at least for the words they in fact use Cheliax is glad to have you here and hopes for the success of your endeavors and hopes that your genius will be represented in our children

Youre welcome But Im not smart or not more than 08 root of average of squares of deviations from average smarter than average I just know some things that werent taught here

He raises an eyebrow at Carissa 

Eighteen she says 

Thats four uh root of average of squares of deviations from average for Golarions unenhanced population

Theres a spell to check

Thats a fucking planetary catastrophe what the ass happened

 Earthfall the wizard says uncertainly But that was eight thousand years ago and I dont actually have reason to think people were smarter before that I have always assumed that were just at the intelligence level we were created at or if you like at the right tradeoff between the costs of creating us and the benefits of having things at our intelligence around my time is expensive why dont you get oriented on things like history and average intelligence and then if you want to buy some of it later you can spend it better And hes supposed to report to the Queen 

Absolutely fair

Keltham is still fundamentally shaken by the notion of a 32sd g world It changes everything on the same level as magic no a lot deeper than that

Also hi Carissa he says out loud I noticed you came along was wondering if you were just here to do the local equivalent of checking in with a Keeper for alien thought process exposure or are you thinking of joining whatever project gets set up

Shes so absolutely been entertaining heresies since her last mind review and shes relieved his society has that concept too I assume theyll send a priest along for that eventually but I was Shes enlisted and goes where the crown sends her which is here thinking of joining whatever gets set up My time isnt comparatively expensive and I can top you off on translation spells and the weather magic we do instead of air conditioning And you know a girl doesnt get mysterious alien strangers dropped on top of her every day and wouldnt want to spend the whole rest of her life wistfully wondering what they got up to

The other wizard teleports out

Most of Keltham is still trying to get to grips with the local intelligence level Its like something is optimizing for making his previous life narrative as unworkable as possible 4SD g is at the level where you dont need to master an impossible art of nonconformity to look in a direction no other nonconformist tried looking in order to see what nobody else saw At 4SD g youre just going to look at random poo and see improvements on it because you are the very smart people who are as smart as the smartest other people who looked at the random poo

He is nonetheless a teenage male and some things are capable of catching his attention even so

Wasnt somebody named Sevar supposed to do the translation spells Is that last line flirting

 she probably only wants him for his brain 

 okay he can work out how he feels later first he needs to preserve optionality which means he needs to flirt back 

Of course Keltham has ever had instruction on how to flirt in the institutions that dath ilan has instead of colleges He is familiar with the theory of common knowledge avoidance that underpins how standard flirting works

Dath ilan isnt going to fling its children out into the world with no concept of how to find explore build or maintain a romantic relationship

And if Im not in the news everywhere it means I failed Unless youre looking for a bit more detail than that

Should he smile after he says the last part No thats escalating way too fast This may not even be flirting what with the enormous cultural gap The whole careful common knowledge avoidance process makes even more sense than usual in this case The appropriate level of signaling back is exactly enough to show that he didnt completely miss the potential implication if it was an implication but no more

Keltham keeps a straight face throughout

Oh are they doing straight faces Sevars my family name Carissas my familiar one Do they not have that where youre from

No with nearly a billion people we calculated globally unique names would need to be too long to remember We go by birth order for unique IDs Two syllables is long enough that youd be moderately unlikely to be good friends with two people with the same name so its what most normies like my parents use in the modern generation Ive considered changing mine to something four syllabled just to be Chaotic about it but common wisdom says I should let my personality finish shaking out up to age 25 first

Well youll have to decide before youre in the news all over the world I dont see how youd change it afterwards

That gets a smile out of him that he decides not to suppress If nobody else has it thats good enough for me But yeah Ill check whether theres anyone else on the planet named Keltham before I go public with that one Wouldnt want to snare any innocents into the dreadful mire of my search shadow

Its not a Chelish name but I dont know how youd check the whole planet we dont all speak a common language or have uh a common mail system or whatever youre imagining The most powerful wizards I know of are Nefreti Clepati and Felandriel Morgethai so four syllables wouldnt even be pushing what you could get away with really

Ha Im Evil but Im never going to be Evil enough to wantonly make people memorize seven syllables just to say hi to me

It is also traditional I think for Evil wizards to have a menacing tower that turns everyone who approaches it into a chicken so as to only be interrupted by people who are very competent or have priorities important enough to them that theyll be turned into a chicken about them

Your world possesses housing options my world did not but not entirely unintriguing ones Speaking of which I should probably figure out domestic things like where Im sleeping before I hit up the nearest library for some quick page glimpses Youre relatively more local than I am want to point out my next step or meta step there

On reflection Keltham decides he should hesitate to flirt any further than this before he has actually thought at all about Carissa Sevar

Well personally were I given the run of the Archduke of Sirmiums summer villa I would go look at all of the bedrooms before I decided which one I was claiming and probably take his own personal bedroom unless hes decorated it grotesquely like with the skulls of his enemies but if youre terribly eager to go to bed we could just ask the staff what their plan was and Im sure theyll have a skull free very lovely bedroom

The skulls of his they can resurrect people right it just costs money That must sure make for some weird social dynamics

At some point Im going to have to figure out the larger social process Im embedded in but I appreciate that it is taking the matter seriously And its not that Im eager to get to sleep its that I expect to be predictably completely sucked in by the new planets library until I finally stumble back vision blurring to finally shower and get to sleep So I need to have planned out all of that final process and asked all the relevant questions about it before I do anything as stickily self motivation altering as stepping into another planets library Sort of thing that drives all other thoughts out of your mind I expect

You talk about libraries like wizards talk about magic She waves impatiently at a child A person proportioned not quite like a human child but about the height of one Show us in so Keltham can look around

The person bows to Keltham Of course master This way

The Taldane word Master floats around in Kelthams mind he can tell that it doesnt map onto employer which hes not polite dath ilani address to a customer or for some reason owner hell figure it out later Right now theres a very short person to follow

The very short person shows him a lovely stonework guest wing with a suite The suite has a very large bed The mattress looks suspiciously like these people havent invented enough materials science for really good mattresses but everything else looks nice 

The short person stokes a wood burning fire in a fireplace across from the bed Theres plumbing he adds proudly and demonstrates a sink

 wow plumbing She casts Detect Magic to get a better look at how it operates even though she needs to figure out whether Keltham expects her to stay here and navigate that gracefully and cant afford to be distracted actually maybe oblivious because distracted by magic would go over well 

Im going to mention once just to get it out of my system that it looks like your civilization doesnt have the technology level necessary to build real bedrooms and wont have that technology level for a good long time even if we all do our best Okay that parts done moving on Carissa whatd you just do to the plumbing

Detect Magic just to get a good look at it I havent seen an indoor plumbing with hot water before In his guest suite even Sirmium must be doing well

Im glad Im more Evil than the average dath ilani and am not flipping out as hard as they would about a planet full of people who have to live without indoor plumbing Thats going to be a matter of scaling Element 29 smelting for the pipes and Im starting to wonder if energy to produce heat to smelt metal is actually going to be the sticking point if indoor hot water is even rarer and I should be looking into the fossil fuel scale before the metallurgical scale Anyways is this room magically advanced enough that the concept of a hot water shower is also known to it

You can put the hot water in the bath Master Keltham the small person says

Do you happen to know how this house heats the water

Contract with a fire elemental I believe maam

Does that scale to where we can contract a fire elemental to melt 1728 third tons of steel per day If thats a spell somebody can cast once per day without them being so expensive as to be completely unhirable we can do an awful lot with 1728 third tons of steel per day squared

I dont know Master Keltham

Bindings fourth circle I dont think one fire elemental could melt that much steel and Im not sure they could melt any You could maybe take the steel to the Elemental Plane of Fire if you had a plan to get it back once youve melted it thatd be two fifth circle spells a day one to get there and one to get back plus whatever you needed to survive there

How much water could they turn to steam in a day And do fire elementals continually add heat energy to wherever they are so that I can melt anything if I can insulate them well enough or do they have an ordinary temperature that only transfers heat to lower temperatures I need to visit the library first and then think about this stuff more later What do I need to know before I go to the library and then stumble back to my bedroom take a bath and go to sleep I should plausibly eat a very quick dinner first or not eat it at all I should know where to find Carissa Sevar in the morning for translation spell and right toilet

 the thought occurs to Keltham for the first time that he may now have occasion to figure out where this sub apartments cuddleroom is if people keep flirting with him and he ever wants to do anything about that Well not a top priority Probably

Why would you do that in your bedroom Why would you do that on your bed That is not what a sleeping pod or sleeping sink is designed to do any more than a sex and cuddling pillow surface is designed to be slept on

Any flirting Carissa may have hoped to accomplish by mentioning beds or sleeping has been lost forever in the abyssal depths of the cultural gap 

Bring dinner Carissa tells the small person who hurries off to do that 

Ill ask for another room on this hall I guess I might be out later in the morning than you because preparing spells takes me about an hour and I cant give you the language until I do that but your existing one shouldnt have worn off yet I dont know how fire elementals transfer heat Thats the toilet Its a marble bench with a small round hole in it and a pit beneath at least fifteen feet deep

There shall be weighty conversations on this topic later at a point where those conversations could actually result in better designed houses springing into existence Noted on wizard morning patterns is there a sign I can detect to know when its safe to knock on your door

In the army there is and also protocols for when to interrupt me before that but I dont actually know what civilians who arent students do I enlisted right out of school Ill use the symbol from the army

No need to say what that is its surely the same symbol used by dath ilani military wizards

If theres any symbol on the door dont knock Knock only if the door looks like a plank of wood devoid of symbols

Acknowledged I feel like Im missing something blindingly obvious clothing laundry Actually these clothes contain an unmeasured amount of exemplar technology with respect to things like the metal alloys in the zippers any plastic components rare element magnets maybe even the weaving patterns in the cloth Theyre my property and indeed my only nonideational property at this point but project valuable to the point where your government actually needs to consider security to prevent them from being stolen Any obvious solutions there

At least they have the concept of theft she was starting to be slightly worried they didnt Probably you should have personal security whenever you leave the house but they should be safe enough here Probably have me launder them with magic instead of giving them to the housekeepers lest they damage them

Security so checking explicitly Youve implied that this is a sufficiently high security area to protect my property from whatever grade of criminal mastermind seems likely to target that property in hopes of obtaining a proprietary trade secret Affirm

Yes She can go double check afterwards but it seems like probably direct word from Asmodeus is enough justification for a lot of people parked outside keeping Keltham safe And keeping him from leaving 

All right Ill be troubling you to magically launder my clothes and will add that to the rest of the informal debts I have piling up with you which I assure you I am noticing Can you think of anything else I should know or do before library oh we were waiting on dinner werent we Any notion of the timescale there

I would expect itll only be a couple more minutes What is your plan for the library exactly just to sit down with a history book and look up every reference until youve chased down everything

The plan is that unless there are entities here which think and write books extremely quickly compared to Keltham they probably cannot fake an entire library in order to control Kelthams flow of information

Lots of random sampling accompanied by trying to infer back the world that the pages were written in Im not trying to acquire thorough knowledge of anything just orient myself to this whole universe

Well if you find the personal diaries of the Archduke youve got to copy a page down so we can mysteriously reference it at parties later and make him wonder how much we know That feels like the right amount of aesthetically Evil while completely unobjectionable even to Good which Keltham seems comfortable in

Dinner arrives It is generous heaps of a dozen different things since they didnt know what hed like fish and rice and bread and shellfish and vegetables and stuffed pheasant and seared meat and fruits and pastries

LADY WHAT she must have been joking even most criminals wouldnt do that and no sensible Archduke would just leave his personal diaries in the library either

Keltham samples everything and will gravitate towards the more protein heavy dishes accompanied by fruit treating the pastries and bread as a dessert He chews the first bites deliberately experiencing and considering and then eats much more rapidly after he has already Observed the New Experience

The food is much better than at the Worldwound and shes going to enjoy it while it lasts She also suspects people are frantically making some arrangements in the library so its better for Keltham not to be done too quickly though shes also not going to observably stall him 

When theyre done shell ask which rooms are free and pick one out and demonstrate the symbol on the door See you in the morning

Suppose so I check explicitly you dont expect me to accidentally get lost on the way to the library or lost on the way back in a way that I cant recover from by running into somebody to talk to

I expect not but if you want an escort I could make space in my schedule

Eh think Im fine checking empirically how lost I get without you before I assume its bad enough you need to be always following me around Im just checking that it is in fact inside the disaster class where you can sensibly plan to see what actually goes wrong and then recover instead of some plausible seeming missteps being bad enough to require advance foresight This language and the number of words it takes to say things oh his ass

You will not wander off a cliff or through a portal to the Abyss if you get lost and probably some of your securitys following you so it should be recoverable

Under other circumstances Keltham might ask about intelligence amplification headbands that might prevent him from forgetting his path but mind amplification is also mind alteration so Keltham is not about to just yank one of those things onto his head even if supplied before he manages to run across some mentions of them in the library

Keltham shall now attempt to explore yet another place where no dath ilani has ever been How is he doing at Finding the Library

If he asks the staff they will show him down a flight of stairs and through a courtyard to a very modest library really Two rooms with high ceilings and shelves full of books

Also its full of teenage girls sitting three to an overstuffed armchair and giggling

Is there anything that looks like a section on gods or a section on global factional politics

Keltham is a bent on his mission and b processing teenage girls as extremely normal inhabitants of libraries It may take him a bit of a delayed drop to ask what theyre doing in a supposedly high security area and why the gender ratio

Theres a section on theology which looks rather sparse and a section on world affairs which seems to have the global factional politics he might hope for 

The teenage girls observe him raptly but dont interrupt he looks in a hurry and also to Detect Magic theres clearly several high level invisible people shadowing him which means it would be a bad idea to make sudden movements even ones that are just accidentally dropping your pen on the floor so as to strategically pick it up 

Keltham rolls against his SED to notice the attention Fails

Theology seems like the highest priority Pull a random book and look at a random page

A series of mental exercises for Asmodeans to practice submission to the will of their god blah blah blah meditations for executing on their intentions successfully Meditations to consider before making a promise Meditations for raising Asmodean children Meditations for blah blah blah anticipating Hell in a productive and confident fashion

Hm Seems broadly consistent with the picture Carissa drew so far Different random page

The physical structure of Hell Its not technically a plane but nine of them the only one accessible from the rest of the universe is Avernus the first where souls go when they die The second is only accessible from the first and third the third from the second etc 

Lets try a different book Do any of them look like theyd have information about the other gods

Nope This library contains no books about gods other than Asmodeus Those are illegal in Cheliax and could have been acquired on very short notice but spot modification would be well hellish

Okay thats downright odd given the extent to which negotiations between gods formed part of this worlds Foundations of Order in the mental picture Keltham was drawing you shouldnt be able to understand current reality without knowing who had what utility function Book on history of divine negotations

Also no

Thats not even a kind of book that can be found on short notice its probably in some private libraries but not Chelish private libraries

A book about Shelyn goddess of art love and beauty has turned up on a shelf in the corner he mustve missed it in his first scan

Great lets flip to a random page in that one

Shelyn once had a brother but then His utility function was inverted and He became a god of torture its very sad 

SHIT WHAT okay lets temporarily forget breadth first search and read the pages before and after that one

For a time she and Dou Bral shared the portfolios of beauty love and the arts and were worshiped by the early Taldans until at some point they argued and Dou Bral abandoned Golarion for the far dark places between the planes

When Dou Bral returned to Golarion he had become the god of mutilation misery and torture Zon Kuthon Believing that Dou Bral still existed within Zon Kuthon Shelyn reached out him but he pierced her hand with his black nails When Thron their father tried to welcome him Zon Kuthon captured and tortured the wolf spirit beyond recognition

One myth speaks of how Zon Kuthon first came into conflict with Abadar the god of culture wealth and stability Seeing the crimes Zon Kuthon committed in Golarion Abadar knew that he must be punished and made a bargain with the evil god Zon Kuthon agreed to go into exile on the Plane of Shadow for as long as the sun hung in the sky in exchange for an item of his choosing from the First Vault This imprisonment was not meant to be over as soon as it was though and when the sun stopped shining upon Golarion during the Age of Darkness Abadar reluctantly honored the deal giving Zon Kuthon the first undead shadow which the Midnight Lord has used to craft evil creatures in his realm of Xovaikain ever since

Okay the utility function inverting thing does not sound like a thing that typically happens to humans walking around but SHIT Golarion has issues How do you even manage to negotiate to a multi agent optimal boundary with the god of mutilation misery and torture Would it accept nonsentient things to torture if the nonsentient things were configured carefully enough to match its utility function or is the utility function too precisely inverted to accept that Does it have any interests in common with the unflipped gods besides the continued existence of the world despite Rovagug 

Lets put this book back for now and go look at global politics

Theres more here Perhaps the Archduke found it more interesting There are dozens of different countries with their own summary books and then books on The Ancient Tian Empires and Lessons From The Pharaohs and Great Heroes Of History and then books on trade routes and shipping and what plants grow in what places and what magical beasts roam which wildernesses

Several of the books have maps and the maps agree on nearby things and diverge on faraway things 

Nidal a nearby country ruled by Zon Kuthon the flipped utility function god At the annual festivals of mutilation people stab one eye out or cut off some of their toes Servants of other gods are barred from entering on pain of a slow and horrible death some Good cults are suspected of operating there anyway though it rarely ends well for them A random flip reveals some sketches of Nidals law enforcement grotesquely scarred people with a bloody whip in one hand a first person account from a refugee who escaped to Cheliax and converted to the service of Asmodeus an excerpt from Zon Kuthons holy books writing about how best to keep people alive while you torture them

Andoran another nearby country was part of Cheliax until it broke away blah blah blah Andoran has now banned Evil and is trying to require everybody to be Good with limited success One of their major social problems is that all of their productive intelligent Evil people left another is that they keep aggravating their allies in the Inner Sea by refusing to contain piracy another is that they abandoned Law when they banned Evil and theres been a corresponding breakdown of the social order A random flip Evil people forced to flee Andoran tell horror stories of the disarray caused by the countrys ban on Evil a ship captain killed by pirates and subsequently resurrected at great cost to his family accuses the government of Andoran of permitting the pirates to stalk the seas for their own benefit a historian on how much more prosperous Andoran was when it was part of Cheliax

Osirion is ruled by a god king selected by Abadar god of blah blah blah Its a poor country but a populous one fed by the generous grain crops of the Sphinx river and has a wealth of ruins of the ancient Osirian empire that adventurers are now painstakingly extracting from their trapped tombs A random flip Osirion is a prospective ally for Cheliax due to their shared commitment to Law Osirions tombs contain relics of an ancient more advanced civilization the pharaohs of seven thousand years ago and Cheliax is collecting and learning from many of those artifacts Another flip is about how Osirion banned grain exporting

Rahadoum another neighbor bans all the gods and all their servants On a random flip a theologian argues that this is ineffectual the exact way gods get information about the Material Plane isnt known and they certainly benefit from worshippers but banning their worship even if people obeyed the ban which they wont just means the gods would rely more heavily on non worshipper methods which do exist the gods for instance know of faraway worlds where they arent worshipped at all On another random flip the case is made that Rahadoum was more prosperous when it was part of Cheliax Another one is about shipping lanes

Any fine subtleties of the Chelish authors are going to be completely wasted on Keltham due to his absolute incredulity at this whole library section

On the first random page Keltham opened to the author was saying what some Duke high level Government official was thinking while ordering the east gates to be sealed which like what how would the historian know what somebody was thinking at best you get somebody elses autobiographical account of what they claim they were thinking and then the writer is supposed to say that what was observed was the claim and mark separately any inferences from the observation because one distinguishes observations from inferences

This This is supposed to be an expository educational history book This is supposedly in the nonfiction section What did the author think they were doing This isnt reasoning this is ink somebody spilled on a page and it happened to come out looking like words and everybody was so amazed at the coincidence they decided to reprint it

There are no probability distributions on this page There are no numbers on this page There are no distinct premises and conclusions anywhere on this page This page contains more fallacies than it contains distinct words

Keltham puts back the book Maybe it was just written by a three year old Yeah Keltham already knows that it wasnt written by a three year old it was written by somebody from a lower intelligence world but maybe the next book will have been written by a member of the cognitive elite wearing an intelligence headband

The next random page in the next random book is written like a school parody of how you would critique somebody elses faction if it had never occurred to the writer that anybody in the audience might think that the other faction would have a different story Like The author doesnt even try to explain what the other faction thought they were thinking The other faction is just supposed to be running around being Wrong because they are the Wrong Faction

Okay so Keltham is just going to adopt the rule of not believing anything that a Golarion author seems to explicitly be saying or even calling attention to and is going to flip through random pages only trying to infer the world that gave birth to these parodies of argument and exposition Just looking for things that the author seemed to assume away as politically nonvalent obvious uncontroversial truths the equivalent of mentioning that the sky is blue when thats not a focus of political attention

To the extent Keltham supposes that this class of inference is reliable it does seem to be confirmed that a place called Cheliax exists

Some other points that Keltham is able to pick up on

 People had higher tech seven thousand years ago What What happened Some kind of infohazard thing that required all the tech to be buried But if that was true why are they digging it up again When dath ilan ran into the Past Infohazard they went to a lot of trouble to mothball all the old cities nobody sane would just wander in and start looking at them without knowing why theyd been hidden

 You get to be a really powerful wizard by killing monsters rather than by deliberate practice Why

 Governance as Keltham knows it does not exist Prediction markets do not exist Delegates Electors Legislators and Tribunes do not exist Nobody seems to be talking about anything that looks like an obvious preference aggregation mechanism Choices get attributed to people and it is at no point obvious why anyone would listen to those people

 People fight giant destructive battles and it does not occur to any author to remark or explain on how multi agent optimal this is not It doesnt seem to be a remarkable fact when it gets mentioned in passing

 It looks sort of like factions have sharp territorial boundaries and theres a thing where you kill the person at the top of the faction and the people inside the faction all switch sides to the other faction that killed them which what why would anybody do that Why of all the things to successfully coordinate on would people coordinate on that Keltham is really missing something here about individual incentives

 This entire planet is so on mind altering drugs Keltham doesnt even just what what what

By the time Keltham reaches anything about Zon Kuthon he catches a glimpse of an infohazardous page winces and just shuts the book He may eventually have to work out what is true and what is Drugs but whatever that was it is probably not the most important thing for him to deal with right now In fact maybe he should move on from the political history shelf entirely

So is there a section of this library about Magic How Does It Even No Seriously What The Fuck Golarion

Theres a book on wizarding education and a book on dragon spellcasting and a book on famous sorcerer bloodlines and their achievements

And what occurs do tell if Keltham flips to the start of the wizarding education book in hopes of finding a careful and reasoned exposition of background theory

Theres a long essay by the author about the foolishness of other wizards who took the wrong approach to the craft and didnt approach it with the discipline Asmodeus requires Then theres a long recounting of his achievements as a wizard and as a teacher of wizardry After that theres a discussion of the simplest spells and meditations you should do in order to find them easier to hold in your head and cast properly and tips for common errors and some argumentation about which simple spell is the best to start with 

Theres no mention of needing to fight monsters in the wizarding education book There is a mention that you should inflict punishments at the end of the day because students are unlikely immediately after a punishment to be able to concentrate on their spellbooks and if youre worried theyll run home and get it healed you can keep them late

Maybe theres some local custom about how written knowledge is supposed to be a record of all the things you shouldnt do and from this you can infer what you actually should do instead Keltham genuinely has no idea if hes even supposed to believe all the bragging the author puts in front of the book about his achievements as presented in a format that Keltham himself finds almost absolutely unconvincing Maybe its this huge string of blatantly false advertisements and its actually signaling cleverness at crafting false advertisements or Keltham doesnt get Golarion at all Is he supposed to believe the thing about storing up punishments to be inflicted at the end of the day in defiance of all behavioral shaping theory if you were even doing that in the first place and the implicit claim that students are so admiring of this teacher and desirous to learn his knowledge that they stick around even after being hurt Keltham is guessing this is just a deliberately unbelievable status brag claim in a very alien format Whatever it should mostly fall under the rule for the moment of not believing any fact which a Drugs Author seems to be actually trying to make him believe

Mostly Keltham is interested in the discussion of the simplest spells the meditations the tips for common errors How does a very basic spellcast actually work if Keltham tries taking what the author says at face value when it hopefully maybe looks like the author isnt being political and would be discussing something that ought to be politically nonvalent ordinary common knowledge

Magic behaves sort of like a liquid but it clings to itself When you have a very little bit of it the clings to itself effects dominate the behaves like a liquid effects and you can shape it which is done through the will of the caster on a complex scaffold that is itself magic doing it without a scaffold is possible magic got started in the first place after all but much much harder The simplest spells are those that need to be shaped as closed 2 manifolds and you have to understand how magic behaves reasonably well to get it to the correct shape and then you have to stabilize it and tie it off after which it sits until you want to cast it Casting it is much simpler you untie it and flick it loose 

Does it say how to get a very little bit of magic and use your will on it in the first place Sort of thing Keltham could try literally right now

You need a spellbook and inks which anchor the scaffold the kinds of ink appropriate for spellbooks are so appropriate because the ink binds to the magic well Heres the spell diagram he personally uses for new students though of course theyll develop their own diagrams over time as they optimize their scaffold for their personal needs

Once you have a spellbook and inks anchoring the scaffold you should be able to learn to feel the magic The meditations help with that Book author recommends preparing spells on the students scaffold while they concentrate it might be easier for them to feel the magic while its in motion Some students pick it up quickly within an hour mostly predicted by lots of childhood magic exposure he doesnt know any promising student to have taken more than a week

 okay promising enough for trying later

But really it feels like there should be much more knowledge available on what magic does even if the natives have no clue why some overview of what it can do Fine they didnt write their books for aliens But Golarion seems to run on magic to an amazing extent There really ought to be a book that gives him a better overview of magic than this somewhere in this library

Why is there no such thing as a subject encyclopedia on any of these shelves Do subject encyclopedias just not scale down to a much smaller Golarion book market Shouldnt they be able to produce small subject encyclopedias

 maybe hes just not in the reference section because the reference section is behind a secret door that looks like a bookcase as any habitual user of Golarion libraries would surely know and take for granted

When you buy your houses separately from the land its on you can afford nice high tech specialist manufactured houses For many many dath ilani the definition of nice would very much include a library with hidden doors that look like bookcases Why what else would you spend money on

Keltham turns around with the intention of identifying some prior library inhabitant who might be able to explain if hes just doing library exploration Completely Wrong

Keltham very quickly turns around and looks back at the bookshelves again Its not what you would call an optimal strategy but it is at least a strategy which can be implemented fast

EMERGENCY INTERNAL KELTHAM MEETING RIGHT NOW

That sure is a lot of girls his age

Pretty ones

In a high security zone

He does not in fact have any right to be surprised by this

Dath ilani civilization would likely try exactly the same thing if somebody showed up from an alternate timeline with 4SD intelligence derived from a different selection history yielding an entirely different set of intelligence promoting alleles

What does his brain mean theres got to be more to think than that

Could this have like happened in some way that would fit exactly into his prior life narrative so he would already know exactly what to think of it Is that too much to ask

Okay Okay Lets just slowly back up and start with most important question here

Does he want to have sex with all the girls in this room

 theres not enough girls in this room if they want to make sure to grab a copy of each of his 46 chromosomes with say 99 probability

While an interesting point this is not really the central point under consideration Does he want to have sex with all of these girls plus a large further number of such thus having enough kids to bring the dath ilani geneset to this world and what bump up the average central intelligence factor by half a standard deviation How many generations would that take and would it actually be all that useful compared to whatever heredity optimization processes the locals are running already

Keltham doesnt actually know offhand how to do those calculations If Keltham had known this was how his life was going to go he would have spent a lot more time studying population genetics sexual technique and flirting

It has been a while since Kelthams mind has ended up in this much internal disarray Its going into loops and repeating the same facts and occasionally the same blank stares just rephrasing the same thoughts over and over Like that sure is a lot of pretty girls and theyre probably also some of the smartest girls around locally even if thats not directly visible at least if they want the next generation of wizards directly off this event which I would in their shoes and I should have realized earlier that rather than just showing up with my head stuffed full of valuable extraworldly information in my brain I actually had a whole lot more highly valuable information inside my testicles

It is in fact this last thought that snaps him out of it Sometimes just rephrasing your existing thoughts in slightly different ways does knock something loose as long as youre not repeating exactly the same thoughts

The sum of his private property on arrival valuable knowledge slightly valuable clothing and valuable genes

Those sneaky sneaks They thought that maybe if they threw enough girls at him fast enough hed be seduced into just going along with that without first asking for any form of compensation for his valuable genetic information

Or possibly they were planning to offer him whatevers standard Keltham has not observed them try to get away with his precious bodily fluids without paying one must distinguish inference from observation after all

But yeah no actual sex with these girls until Keltham is oriented enough to know how local money works and set up an explicit contract

 snuggles

Oral

Okay so given the sheer amount of internal disarray he has going on here he is going to give himself time to think about this absorb and not come to a conclusion right away

They do say not to rush into sex if you are feeling rushed and that probably extends unchanged even to very large quantities of sex Why is his brain slightly reluctant to accept that obvious seeming meta conclusion

Invisibly and also inaudibly two high level wizards spent a truly heroic length of time trying to have straight faces at each other and its not totally clear who failed first because it was basically simultaneous

I says one of them the one who doesnt need to breathe because he has a necklace of adaptation reject the explanation that this is what people are like without free will or with better training in not using it

The other one doesnt have a necklace of adaptation and does need oxygen and so takes several minutes to catch his breath My theory is that probably if I can trust my premises here Cheliax exists

We should add to the list of things that go wrong with a honeypot setup he decides that the presence of girls implies that his ejaculate is very valuable and he should not give it away for free

Should we though When it will absolutely never ever happen again

Well if we commission thousands of him maybe in a few generations its a common problem

Gods forbid

From what I know the gods seem supportive

You know if Nethys gives people too much of Himself theyre driven mad and destroy themselves Maybe if Abadar gives people too much of Himself theyre driven mad and end up like this

I have heard as many as several things about the pharaoh of Osirion and that seems probably wrong

But was it presented with the observations and inferences separated with numbers for every sentence No I submit that you know nothing about Osirion except that a book writer wanted you to believe that it exists

Observation Osirian women cant own money Inference therefore the pharaoh probably does not oblige them to pay him to fuck them

I didnt hear any numbers

Thirty seven Point one five Eight hundred ninety six

Ah A credible claim then

Keltham needs a Plan

He needs to handle this attempted mass mating rush in a way that neither immediately escalates to cuddling nor signals that he is opposed to the mass mating per se

Can he just be nice and smile at the girls but pretend not to notice their flirting attempts for now possibly Or be deliberately ambiguous leaning negative but with occasional positive signs thrown in Would that work to correctly signal that he was delaying but leaving his options open if the underlying strategy was successfully decoded by the other side Its more of a classically feminine stratagem than a classically masculine one but feminine is here standing in for the sexuality in relatively greater demand and the inversion for his own case should be as obvious to them as it is to him And even if the stratagem isnt correctly decoded by the amorous horde obscured by unknown subgaps of the cultural gap between he and they it seems relatively failsafe Given the common knowledge avoidance underlying theory of flirting sending ambiguous signals should avoid either escalating or terminating 

Wait That style of flirting exists in dath ilan deployed by people who know what common knowledge is Common knowledge is not a very advanced formalism but it is very plausibly not something that is known here or plausibly something that exists but is beyond the lower quartile of a population with 32 average intelligence

A lot of romantic complications seem like they would plausibly be beyond the lower quartile of a 32g world if that world designed or just equilibrated to romantic norms that worked for almost everyone

 do amorous girls in Cheliax even do subtlety at all 

No he might be panicking prematurely here Carissa opened by saying that shed be curious about what happened to him but afterwards mentioned that Keltham might be tired and need to find a bedroom to sleep in rather than suggesting that they immediately go to a cuddleroom Romantic norms here probably call for some subtlety Probably

 how about if he smiles in a friendly way looks appreciative of appearances and pretends not to notice any overtures that arent fully overt Hes from a very alien place and it should be much more plausible than usual that he actually isnt picking up on flirting attempts

At the point where Keltham noticed that hed been surrounded by pretty girls his own age hed been about to ask around for library help in case he was looking in the wrong place to find subject encyclopedias

Keltham observes of himself that he is in fact scared even armed with his new Plan

The stereotypically wise question to ask when youre scared is Suppose you go on avoiding this forever how well will that work out for you

And Keltham knows well that he does not in fact wish to avoid talking to amorous female hordes forever Every man must at some point talk to the amorous female hordes bent on mating with him and pretend not to notice This is wisdom

In full knowledge that he is both silly and doomed for he is not without understanding of how his own life might appear seen from the outside Keltham turns around to address the library

Do any of you happen to know if Im looking in the right place for Taldane doesnt have the word subject encyclopedia Great The kind of book on magic that would say how much weight magic can lift how much water it can turn to steam how fast a little bit of magic accelerates when it clings to another little bit of magic

He has the rapt attention of the horde 

Principles of Spell Design has that someone says instantly

I dont know if theyll have that here

Archduke Henderthanes not a wizard I dont think 

 he might not say 

 but most of the noble housesve got sorcerous bloodlines rather than studying to be wizards 

 it was only recently under the glorious guidance of House Thrune and Asmodeus that wizardrys better than a sorcerer bloodline 

And it still you know depends on the sorcerer bloodline And on how smart you are

And if youre a noble youre enhancing splendour not cunning which works better with being a sorcerer 

 anyway if hes either not a wizard or pretending not to be he wont have Principles of Spell Design in his public library

Ostensos Imperial Academy Of Magic has it thats where we go to school

Probably someone could fetch it for you

 Did the local government assign him a research harem Because these pretty girls sound a lot like an engineering team that somebody just tossed a problem

Okay thats honestly kind of awesome Keltham is not going to complain about this at all

Expect Im gonna want a lot of books that arent here if theres better libraries than this Keltham says out loud Unless its very low overhead to grab them one at a time lets build up a list before making a run Principles of Spell Design definitely sounds like the kind of title that should be on it Does anybody see a standout good book thats already here for quickly getting some picture of magical basics Right now I have very little idea of what magic can do or whats already been tried

The girls have ostensibly been examining the selection of books in this library for the last three hours but they spring into action to actually examine the selection 

You want Bloodlines its got a breakdown of all the known wizard spells by which sorcerer bloodlines manifest them and so its got a breakdown of all the known wizard spells

I know I saw Serranos Abjuration 

I have Lorcas A Definitive Guide To Summons in my backpack 

Thats no good I have Marias and its better 

All known wizard spells sounds hella useful Though the fact that theres a bookable finite list implies incredibly strong design constraints why isnt that like saying that one of your books contains all known blueprints for technology that uses electricity Maybe she just meant all the known popular ones

Bloodlines is found in the library Its in eight volumes but its distinctly finite The girls are quietly arguing with each other about which is the definitive text on Transmutation and about how far afield the book fetchers will be persuadable to go There is at least one whispered Asmodeuss direct orders 

Keltham is sufficiently intent on rapidly flipping through All The Wizard Spells that hes unlikely to overhear any whispers like that

WHAT WHAT IS THIS HOW IS THIS THE LIST OF WIZARD SPELLS WHAT

Mages Faithful Hound

5th Circle Conjuration

You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself It then guards the area where it was conjured it does not move The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area but if they leave and return they activate the barking The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures It does not react to figments but it does react to shadow illusions

If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite once per round The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature see invisibility Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction The hound cannot be attacked but it can be dispelled

The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level but once the hound begins barking it lasts only 1 round per caster level If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound the spell ends

So you could either send something into the Elemental Plane of Fire or alternatively with the same conserved resource expenditure materialize a temporary domesticated wolf Not like a barky bitey sphere or something a domesticated wolf specifically

The spell list is incredibly varied gratuitously exotic around three quarters focused on combat albeit this does make some sense if wizards only get more powerful by defeating monsters and exponentially too tiny for a list of possible structures that can be made that complicated and which are key to a whole society

But wait the pipes were enchanted to deliver hot water werent they Maybe all the utility stuff is magic items right The wizard spells are just the structures you can build using an item scaffold tie off and then carry around until you fire them at something It would make sense for those to be combat focused because thats the context in which youd fire something immediately and without carefully constructing a reusable magical item to do it instead

It still doesnt make sense how theres a short finite list of structures this exotic Unless 

Two wild ass guess hypotheses Keltham says out loud Confirm or refute Hypothesis one only gods or some extremely rare class of people with access to restricted stuff can create or rather compile but Taldane doesnt have the word spell designs Hypothesis two theres a much wider variety of magicalized devices than standard wizard spells too many for there to exist a comprehensive book set listing all such device templates Also sorry all my words come out so long and stuffy sounding theyd be shorter in my native language

Spell design is really hard and only gods or extremely powerful ancient wizards can do it from scratch one of the girls confirms and yes you can do a wider variety of things with magic items

What you can do with magic items is combine elements more freely someone else says If there are two items that do different things you can build one item that does both You cant do that with spells at all And you can make a magic item that casts a spell once an hour or twice an hour or on a trigger thats really tricky to put in a spell

Im approaching certification in item crafting if you have more questions specifically about that

Keltham has been trying to figure out what obvious to him things would not have already been tried How are magic items at precision focusing forces down to smaller levels Lets say I want to take all the power that would go into something like a mages faithful hound and apply all that power to compressing and heating something the size of a dust speck

The girl looks crestfallen I dont know I think itd take more skill to make something that can work on very small things

Sort of thing a topnotch research team could do in a week a month a year a decade or never

I think if it could be done in a week someone wouldve done it Though they might have and not published it depending what its useful for

Possible component of a device that would make a lot of heat for smelting more iron and steel Im wondering if we can skip coal mining and go straight to an analogue of fire that requires much higher starting temperatures and produces much greater amounts of heat when something burns That might work if magic can take a fixed quantity of heat and focus it down into a small enough volume that the local temperatures are incredibly high like thousands of times higher than molten iron and Ive already verified that somebody from this world didnt seem to have the corresponding basic knowledge to know what the underlying constituents of matter were or how to burn them so its the sort of thing that nobody here might have tried yet Oh but dont try that on your own until weve all nailed down equity distributions and intellectual property so I can explain further details Its legitimately dangerous if you dont know what youre doing

Basic physical principles should plausibly be given away as gifts because its hard to make them excludable and theyre too necessary for others making basic research contributions but specific inventions should still be charged for is Kelthams current thought Keltham might feel differently about it if hed personally discovered all of the relevant physical principles But in fact Keltham is carrying a lot of dath ilan produced information that he got for free and that dath ilan would have preferred him to spread around and he is as he has just contemplated honorable even in the dark

The idea that theres an analogue of fire that burns things if you get the starting temperature high enough and yields much more energy for that matter the idea of binding energies and mass defects for nuclei should under this policy be given away for free Knowing that you can extract hydrogen from water and burn that in particular or hydrogen and boron if they can get the temperatures high enough that would be safer and less radioactive to do inside a steel furnace seems more in the realm of specific inventions that he could charge for

Or actually given some of the weirder exotic effects hes seen in the spells maybe he should more privately at some point talk about squeezing down some impenetrable wall of force around a bigger mass of liquid hydrogen until the whole thing fuses for purposes of trying to destroy the Worldwound Actually hed first need to ask whether enormous explosions would have any effect on the Worldwound at all

Is that squirrel thinking about how to do SCIENCE to MAGIC in order to create HUGE EXPLOSIONS

The existing treaties about enormous destructive magical explosions admittedly dont encompass this but new ones that do should be agreed upon promptly because if there are a lot of explosions of that kind there wont be anything anyone values left on Golarion also that particular squirrel should NOT be encouraged to blow itself up that particular squirrel is very valuable

This is so exciting Prophecy is broken and now the squirrels are going to develop magical nuclear weapons centuries ahead of Nethyss schedule

The squirrel appears to be in Cheliax Nethys goes off to bother Asmodeus about this

The top decile of attractive girls at Ostensos Imperial Academy of Magic are diligently taking notes and also exchanging glances at the announcement that there are equity distributions involved in this It kind of sounds too good to be true but he is a bizarre alien An oblivious bizarre alien

Keltham shall continue asking extremely basic and or extremely difficult questions And seizing one book after another from the library this time with their guidance and reading random pages from it

Facts that are likely to become clear to his audience

 Keltham does tend to look at you when you drop a pen on the floor and strategically pick it up

 Keltham believes that they were assigned to him as a research team

 Keltham is a proud man but has an alien concept of pride which does not preclude him continually calling his own ideas stupid

 Keltham thinks himself to be in charge of something he calls the Golarion Industrialization Project but does not seem to act or talk in any way that reflects this self assigned high status Trying to show him overt signs of deference causes him to produce odd looks and uncomfortable side glances

 Keltham thinks his researchers all need to learn basic calculus in order to be able to work on his project Obviously they are going to be dealing with all sorts of things that equilibrate and you need to learn derivatives to understand equilibria Keltham hopes the smarter ones among them can have learned the basics there before they reconvene tomorrow

 Keltham is following an unknown ruleset for sexual mindgames which permits him to appreciate prettiness and physical stretches through completely direct and unhidden looking but not to respond verbally to verbal hints of interest

 Kelthams mind runs completely skew to all other mindgames played in Cheliax

 Keltham has absolutely no idea how Golarion Cheliax or this entire universe operates

 Keltham believes and takes for granted that they are all being paid lots of money to work for him

They were not technically told to tell Keltham theyre being paid lots of money to work for him but if he is under this impression maybe itll incline him to pay them lots of money once hes negotiating those equity contracts Seeming vulnerable to coercion is rarely in ones interests They have some cheerful conversations about what to buy with all the money they are hypothetically being paid 

Given the actual assignment here the students of Ostensos Institute etc etc are mostly interested in figuring out Kelthams worlds ruleset for flirting but if calculus is part of it then they will certainly learn calculus 

Once Keltham has gone to bed therell be a debrief with the mindreaders and hopefully itll clear up all the confusing bits 

Keltham notices himself starting to become tired which means he should stop now He could go on further but hes planning to try to poke or summon his Intrinsic World Keltham god followed by trying to talk to Asmodeus so any energy hell predictably recover after a hot bath should be reserved for that

Now that hes pausing to think about it on reflection how suspicious is it that hes managed to run around this whole library learning about spells and wondrous items and some small amount of basic magical theory and what little is known here about material science without learning much about the gods whose utility functions and strategies apparently play a critical role in determining the equilibria of this whole universe

 yeah pretty suspicious Not quite as suspicious as it would be if all the books werent written with appallingly low reasoning standards implying a world whose general epistemics are cratered on some quality levels Not as suspicious as it would be if that library hadnt also lacked good explanatory books and knowledge about spellcraft compared to what some research haremettes were able to pull out of their bagpacks because they were wizard students specifically It could just be a really really really awful reference library

But the theory that they were trying to prevent him from knowing too much about other gods also made a tentative advance prediction about how much luck hed have in the library and that prediction has now been fulfilled

On the plus side theres now a lot more entities than just Cheliax of whose mere existence Keltham is moderately confident in the branch of possible reality where the whole library wasnt just faked And while that faking is very possible given his current epistemic state there are levels of paranoia which are hard to operate productively Like maybe they can just manufacture whole books from scratch as I want to look at them or maybe a god is individually puppeting all the other humans present or maybe one of the girls is an illusion disguised advanced wizard who is mind controlling me to think some thoughts but not others Theres so many possible paranoid theories like that and they typically dont imply obvious low cost winning counterstrategies

Off to his bedroom Keltham goes after exhorting his research harem to sleep well for there is much to be done the next day

Hes completely insane Elias Abarco fifth circle divination specialist with Chelish intelligence declares shooing the teenagers out of an armchair so that he can flop in it and expound on this I dont know if everyone in his world is like that he conceives of himself as an outlier but he conceives of himself as an outlier in our direction less Lawful more Evil so maybe the rest of them are even worse Theres not going to be a good gentle way to break it to him that Hell is painful and theres not going to be a good gentle way to break it to him that Cheliax bans heresy and Im not even sure theres going to be a good way to break it to him that we execute murderers Or the bit of good news is that I dont think itll especially occur to him that Cheliax is worse than other places along the dimensions he cares about hell be as unimpressed with anywhere else

Did he notice people flirting Yaisa Castilla who was doing a frankly exhausting amount of flirting asks as soon as theres enough of a pause that its plausibly not an interruption

 yes Abarco says He uh do you want to explain 

Atanasio Torres sixth circle conjuration specialist with Chelish intelligence glares murderously at Elias he thinks you all were offered as an effort to trick him into sharing his genes with Cheliax without getting paid he says eventually So he doesnt want to get anyone pregnant until thats been negotiated

What

Negotiated with who

His there are other men at eighteen intelligence

I thought he specifically wanted to have hundreds of children

He didnt just not get anyone pregnant he wouldnt even flirt with us

 he mightve been thinking its harder to exercise self control farther along 

I also suspect he doesnt have much sexual experience says Abarco And remember he is insane Youll be really confused if you try to model him as a sane person

Whod he like best

Im not sure he was successfully differentiating you

Whatd he like best

 I think at least in the abstract he admires uh subtlety

Hes not subtle

Well hes insane

Keltham takes a very long hot bath much longer than he usually takes hot showers Its honestly been kind of a day for him Even after the plane crash He was simultaneously trying to infer the reality of an entire world and neither confirm nor deny his sexual attraction to a room full of women whose individual identities he would have more luck keeping track of if they had been introduced to his experiential universe one at a time And if they had not all been wearing identical school issued clothing And not been of all the same unfamiliar appearance cluster that isnt whatever appearance cluster a dimensional outsider would assign to dath ilan that Kelthams facial recognition centers have been trained to discriminate inside And if they didnt all have two separate names That were all built from the same unusual distribution over consonants Or if they didnt all tend to talk at the same time

On reflection he did like that one who always insisted she could do something better than some other girl whod spoken previously But its been a long night since she last identified herself and he has not remembered her name

Eventually Keltham lies down in bed closes his eyes and for only a short time tries to think more like a Keeper

The Keepers conserve much that is hazardous maybe not even the greatest Keeper knows how much would you really want all the cognitohazards concentrated in one person and of that it will often be true that the larger part of any secret is the fact that the secret exists But among the cognitohazards that Keepers are known to conserve there is most famously the fact that if you go all out on thinking in ways that locally obey coherence theorems in order to ape the higher unbounded structures it can sometimes be wearing on the more human parts of the human

It is a necessary implication of the Utility structure that you can for any three outcomes orderable by strict preference x y z mix the outer two outcomes x z at some probability p x 1 p z in order to yield a mixed outcome of which you are indifferent between that and a certainty of y

Or in plainer language there exists some probability p which is small enough that if you are a coherent thinker you would rather have a 1 p probability of getting the smallest local unit of money say a ten thousandth of a labor hour and a p probability of dying the true death compared to having nothing Or a p probability of your mothers true death or less pleasant things

Most normal people that is people inside a small range around average intelligence that includes Keltham would not get much further in life on account of insisting to themselves that they confront such points That just sets up the component parts of you to get angry or sad about the higher logical structures that your more abstract parts are thinking about There is no urgent need no benefit whatd be the point of the soulstrife

But that Keltham is guessing is the way a small mind should try to arrange itself if it wants to receive overly direct messages from a large mind without that hurting too much Hes seen the books these people write they do not have their facts and their values clearly labeled and separately binned they do not know what is observation and what is inferred they dont break down multistep inferences into steps or at least they write like that But Keltham can imagine how that mind internally so disorganized might slosh around and maybe hurt if somebody dropped a FACT and a STRATEGY with an EXPECTED UTILITY into it when that was something outside of its native ontology

Where the problem is of course that Keltham is not really a Keeper and his own mind is also going to be very disorganized very human very not a locally coherent shard of higher unbounded Validity Probability Utility Decision Hes not sure as he contemplates this that there is very much he can do by thinking and meditating to improve on whatever dath ilan has already given him in the way of thoughts clearly separated and binned He already draws as many distinctions as hes going to draw his mind already has as much landing area as itll have for the assertion that some fact is 30 likely or that one strategy is preferred to another by an amount that has a ratio to how much he prefers a hot shower over a hot bath

But for whatever its worth Keltham tries to make it that much easier for whatever god to see him and maybe talk to him He thinks about his direct sensory observations mostly the now internalized and partial memories of Carissa his brain retrieves these memories from these he infers the corresponding past experiences not a certain inference there could be memory altering spells Carissa may have been veridically describing a world in need of industrialization He has seen letters upon pages in another language he has had that selfsame language inserted into his mind by spell and those written pages seemed to confirm in passing the existence of that world People exist in that world incoherent but just barely coherent enough that you can look at them and idealize out notions of preference shards of Utility there is then the opportunity for Coordination multiplayer strategies that gain more utility for all those players of this is symbolized wealth money and this Keltham desires himself not so much because he plans to buy particular things here but because he will be able to buy things in the future And because he is proud and wants to prove something maybe he can never prove what he could have done in dath ilan and maybe it is easier to acknowledge now he could not have done anything in dath ilan but if Keltham cannot make something of himself even here where he is this special then what is he worth at all

But all that is Kelthams Pride and Keltham sets it aside for contacting Asmodeus later It is there only to be acknowledged as the thing that lends Utility to the outcome that Keltham prefers as he reaches out to a hypothetical god theorized relative to a background reality that was inferred but never directly observed A god that desires higher Coordination for its own sake and for the sake of all the people who gain their own utility as they go about their own ways and through their own efforts Because Keltham is hoping for these probable classes of outcomes that are the industrialization of Golarion and Keltham taking his own profit from it if he and the God of Coordination can shift their strategies mutually in some unknown way He is in his decision to think this hoping for the outcome where the God of Coordination talks to him about that part leading to a corresponding abstract unknown shift in Kelthams actual strategies along with the Coordination Gods strategies and perhaps also whatever relationship is bound up in being a cleric 

 the squirrel has contorted itself up into a really odd actually unprecedented shape some strange half mockery of Lawful thought And prophecy in this world is broken This fragment of Abadars attention is not smart enough to immediately forecast with certainty using just naked intelligence what happens if you talk to a squirrel while it is curled up in that weird shape Probably nothing terrible but squirrels are fragile even under the best of circumstances this squirrel is strange prophecy is broken and it would be awfully tragic if this one exploded

This isnt even Asmodeuss fault Abadar specifically paid for that part not to happen Its all the squirrels own idea whatever this is

As a side note this does tend to confirm the set of theories where this squirrel actually has no idea what its doing Which would tend to go along with the class of hypotheses where the squirrel came from outside Golarion and maybe the whole local multiverse This world sure got itself messed up didnt it

Hopefully the squirrel tries praying in a more normal posture at some point and Abadar can have a more normal divine conversation

At least the squirrel is now explicitly asking to be a cleric

Cleric levels get exponentially more expensive very fast as you add more of them when that happens by direct divine intervention But its clear that this squirrel could use more help than just the one cleric level if its going to have any chance of surviving to divulge the more important things it knows

With the equivalent of a frustrated sigh Abadar moves to drop three cleric levels on this very strange squirrel 

Make it seven Itll be more exciting with seven Nethys will totally pay to make up the difference Abadars into that sort of thing right

 drops seven levels on the squirrel

What it feels like to be a cleric varies because if you perturb a part of a humans brain the rest of the brain will generate all kinds of explanations of what just happened Its not outside the space of experiences that people report without in fact actually being a cleric because theyre fasting or on drugs or just meditating very intensely but this doesnt usually produce a lot of confusion because afterwards you either have spells or you dont

Commonly reported a feeling of being seen by a penetrating beam of light That feeling that you sometimes get in a dream where you see someone and hug them and know as a sort of background fact that they are the love of your life and you are reuniting after a long separation even if your awake mind is pretty sure that person doesnt exist A feeling of noticing theres something in your chest or in your arms thats been there your whole life but which you just realized you can move A sense of being showered in transcendent divine love A really intense variant of coming out of subspace A moment of all your sensory input sending THE DIVINE instead of their usual format of sensory input A feeling of opening your eyes except they were already open

 whoa That is the most interesting if extremely transient drug effect that Keltham has ever experienced

Keltham desires to communicate in more detail because that will probably lead to classes of outcomes where he can execute more effectively on Golarion industrialization and also on bringing more honorable Coordination to this weird place

Abadar is scared to talk to you when youre like this Abadar doesnt know what will happen if He does

Nobody seems to be talking back to Kelthams carefully coherently configured desires for communication with the divine But something definitely just spoke to him or touched him or patted his head or screamed in inaudible frustration or or something

Maybe he should call off further experiments until checking in with Carissa or other domain experts since he tried what felt like the most obvious avenue and got a result that was very briefly like being on drugs Some drugs are dangerous especially if you take a lot of them Or maybe thats just what happens if you try to talk to some weird god that wasnt already in Golarion and Asmodeus a known quantity would still be safe to try to contact 

 wait a minute

There is definitely a sort of affordance inside Kelthams mind that wasnt there before Like a door inside himself with a flat plate that is clearly meant to be pushed rather than pulled

 did the god of Keltham or whatever he managed to touch just cleric him

Keltham did manage to pick up from random library pages that some clerics are supposed to be able to heal without much preparation That inner metaphorical door feels like it should if he opens it like this 

Warm divine energy washes in Keltham and through him clearing away the lingering strained muscles from his earlier frantic dash through the Worldwounds cold

First spell heck yeah

 wait This also means that whatever god it was just clericed Keltham and didnt tell him anything

Darn it Keltham would really have thought the god of Keltham would have been interested enough in the Golarion industrialization plan to say something

 assuming Keltham even got approximately the god he tried to visualize

Okay Keltham is feeling a little out of his depth and slightly apprehensive about the potential side effects of his clever plans that hes just been charging ahead into This is a bit of a Maybe Not Easily Revocable Event with Side Effects that hes gotten as a result Hes going to sleep and then hell talk to Carissa or other domain experts tomorrow morning about his sudden clericing before he proceeds further

No one interrupts his sleep though there are a lot of unhappy stressed conversations happening where he cant hear them

Keltham sleeps for a while his dath ilani port of origins sleep cycle not matching up exactly with Cheliax time He is woken still a bit woozy by the harsh light of Cheliaxs Sun coming in directly through the windows Somehow Keltham had failed to foresee in advance the connection between the generally primitech bedroom and the fact that the Sun was just going to shine in through the windows completely unimpeded come the morning

Keltham draws on his unfortunately scented valuable clothes after a brief abortive failed attempt to request a cleric spell that will launder them and goes to see if Carissa is disturbable yet

Carissa wakes up in an unfamiliar place and spends a minute trying to figure out if she ill advisedly went off with someone last night oh No Well sort of but more complicatedly than that 

She both needs to really think about Keltham and is nervous about doing it because how did he put it shell be reviewed for alien thought patterns And she suspects that there are some lying there sort of dormant waiting for her to devote them enough attention that they can spool out into fully grown heresies 

No

Asmodeus ordered Keltham taken to Cheliax and protected She doesnt know the exact content of Asmodeuss orders only the bits that pertain to her she should not use mind altering magic on him or hurt him or threaten him she should keep him safe if a situation somehow arose in which that fell to her Which it really shouldnt Asmodeus thinks Keltham is valuable Representative perhaps of what humans should be of what theyll be once they are purified in the fires of Hell Not all the way there hes still human hes still imperfect but much closer

Therefore trying to understand Keltham isnt going to be heretical There might be awkward intermediate steps where she believes something thats wronger than either her current beliefs or the correct set of beliefs because understanding Keltham isnt something thats been done before where all of the heresies have been already identified so you can be warned against them and if necessary punished out of them But the end goal here is to approach Asmodeuss perfection which Keltham is closer to than her even though hes not even smarter 

She stares at the ceiling idly tracing this set of thoughts in circles until it no longer distracts her and shell be able to pray in a less self centered way Theres no altar in this guest room so she kneels on the floor facing the wall

Asmodeus my lord my god owner of my immortal soul steward of the fate of Golarion and all the distant stars if it pleases You make me Your worthy servant May it serve Your aims to anticipate my stupidity and my errors and my flaws and teach me better to show me how I can be useful to You and preserve me that I may grow in your service to perfect me See me in my weakness my unworthiness my foolishness and see the bits of me that You can use and help them grow in me that I may be useful to you and worthy of Your eternal life Help Cheliax grow in strength and power that it may spread Your power through the world and bring Your teachings to everyone everywhere Help Keltham of dath ilan to serve you even if I think he does not have the concept that one should serve gods and even if we havent told him what You are and what You demand of us Help us understand You better that we may know the explanation of You that Keltham could embrace Guide my mind in the path of understanding so that I do not fall into heresy or weakness or lies so that I can reconcile all that I know of You so that I can witness for You 

Her heart is beating a little faster by the end probably out of the vague awareness that Asmodeus did recently directly concern Himself with this precise thing and of course He talked to His priest not to Carissa but still it suggests a degree of attention that most mortals do not ever experience and mortals are endlessly disappointing to Asmodeuss direct attention She tries for a second to see herself as a god must see her tiny stupid disorganized contemptible frustratingly the sort of agent they must use to act in the Material Plane but maybe that too is heretical trying to imagine being a god 

Theres a knock on the door 

Come in she says but remains kneeling 

Sevar Im to brief you Have you prepared spells yet

Not yet She stands up Her legs have lost their circulation and are numb and prickly

Well first briefing highlight dont bother preparing Detect Thoughts he became a third or fourth circle cleric overnight and now we cant read him

He what Of who

Thats a very good question Lawful Neutral Probably Abadar Could also be Irori or uh Erecura or Otolmens someone we havent heard of

I havent heard of Otolmens Carissa says wiggling her toes experimentally

I hadnt either until an hour ago Lawful Neutral god of stopping mortals from exploiting physical or mathematical features of the world that permit destroying it

Theres a god of that

Its not advertised since that you know implicitly communicates that there are physical and mathematical features of the world you can use to destroy it But yes And uh Keltham was contemplating ways of exploiting physical or mathematical features of the world to create really big explosions so now we have learned that Otolmens exists and Theyre on the list of candidate Lawful Neutral gods who gave Keltham cleric levels last night though one of the unlikeliest

Carissa takes several moments to think of something to say to that The first thing that has come to mind is what was his idea to create really big explosions but if she needs to know that shell be told She doesnt want to destroy the world at all shes entirely certain she can pass a loyalty screen about that Three or four circles all at once Does he have any idea how to use them

He does not Nor how unusual that is though we dont think we should bother pretending its not unusual Were hoping hell ask you once hes awake which he isnt yet

Will he know what god hes a cleric of

We dont think so

Dont people who become clerics usually know what theyre a god of

Usually theyre praying to a specific god He wasnt He was praying to the abstract concept of Lawfulness sort of Which cannot encleric people though Someone evidently could and did

 I see How did his library run go he hasnt decided hes opposed to Asmodeus or anything

He uh was really disappointed by the standards of argumentation in all of the books and thinks maybe theyre deliberately instructively bad

 whats bad about them

Its not how propaganda is written in dath ilan I think Theres a lot more attention to making it the sort of thing that looks like on close reading itd persuade a neutral very intelligent observer

Carissa isnt sure whats safe to say about that but but it seems impossible the kind of vision that youd only have if youd never encountered a world with free willed humans in it thered be no reason for a neutral very intelligent observer to pick Cheliax or for that matter any other country aside from whoever offered them the best deal in Keltham ish terms but obviously unless youre Keltham no ones offering you a deal of any kind the point of a book is to teach you what youre supposed to believe not to convince someone who doesnt have any constraints on what they believe she suspects Keltham wouldnt like that but she cant articulate precisely why not Well everyones very smart and they have all that training in not spilling free will all over the place she says

Yes I expect probably the best line on the books is that most people are very stupid

This feels unfair to the book authors They are balancing such fascinating constraints trying to say new things while also reinforcing all the things that must be communicated by anything published in Cheliax She learns a lot from reading the newest edition of history books Yes of course she says

We got about a dozen girls from the Imperial Academy of Magic in Ostenso in here and he spent a while mulling it over and decided not to sleep with any of them until hes negotiated payment for his trouble

For his hes a teenage boy He said he wanted a hundred forty four children

Yes but he figures he has a lot of negotiating power given how rare his genes are in our population his society has done more sophisticated study of genetics and you should ask him questions about it at some point 

Have you tried having one of the girls be hurt at him that he doesnt want her unless hes getting paid for it no I guess its probably not worth the trouble even if itd work 

You can try it if you want We want him to form some attachments here but we arent invested in any particular vision for it 

Im not going to try it says Carissa irritably unless thats an order I dont care to compete with a bunch of students for who can be the most clingy and emotionally immature

As I said we arent invested in any particular vision for it He was pleased about the girls and well probably end up paying him to sleep with them He assumes theyre getting paid as well I think just on a general principle that any society would obviously generously compensate people doing valuable things Hes so confused by this You did mention dath ilan is Good

They are Good but hmm did you personally read his mind or did you just get reports theyre Good but they dont even care that much about Good versus Evil because theyve got so much Law that Evil just you know how banditrys Evil and Cheliax mostly doesnt have it because we have the rule of Law that but also for you know assassinations and shady business practices and I strongly suspect for mistreating your slaves though he did independently suggest buying babies so they must have slavery at all hes not Good hes probably got some Good shaped assumptions but I bet if you asked him why Cheliax would obviously be paying them hed have a Law sort of answer I admittedly dont have any idea what itd be

Well The pay is that youre doing your duty to your nation and will be supplied with materials as appropriate

Thats of course as appropriate to maintain the pretense that theyre all being paid well so they might in fact end up being paid well Carissa decides not to press the point right now I am honored to be of service she says blandly If were lying about pay I take it were not trying to explain Asmodeus to him yet

No one has any idea how The theological gaps are large the cleric levels suggest hed have somewhere to go if he decides to walk out you did a pretty good job on the fly incidentally presenting the nature of Evil to him

Carissa did not expect that acknowledgment at all and smiles back while frantically trying to think through what could possibly be meant by it 

The man delivering the briefing meets her eyes levelly Continues I think most people would have explained that we are the property of Asmodeus that He owes us no consideration that in Hell we are cleansed and perfected and that would have gone very poorly

Shes being accused of something Shes just not sure exactly what He would have walked away she agrees There are other churches at the Worldwound

Yes And youve been at the Worldwound in fairly close contact with the worshippers of other gods with adventurers from all around the world in the course of your duties as a researcher

Oh Carissas mind is suddenly oddly clear Yes I knew how hed react because Ive spoken with opponents of Asmodeus and with adventurers from far away confronted with His ideals for the first time I have no formal training in interaction with heretics or enemies of the state but it has occurred to me in the last day that at this point I might seek some She has passed every single review but he knows that thered be no point in mentioning it

It takes a special sort of devotion to be exposed to such ideas to model them closely enough to know how to respond to someone like Keltham without entertaining heresy yourself

With all due respect sir that doesnt seem right to me All the arguments of Asmodeuss opponents have been very stupid and obviously wrong

Hmm Even Kelthams

He hasnt voiced them sir because he doesnt know what to object to

What argument do you think he would make

That doesnt have a safe answer She suppresses a flash of frustration I dont know sir

Do you see my dilemma here Sevar

Its an important question to get right and she doesnt see it she doesnt know what hes pushing at he doesnt want to arrest her right now maybe he does maybe hes working with one of the students to eliminate the competition well he shouldnt want to arrest her right now itll make Keltham suspicious so hell need a good justification 

Theres the thing Keltham said himself last night about how shed need to do the equivalent of checking in with a Keeper for alien thought patterns the alien thought pattern of him the things shed realized when she read his mind 

Youre worried hes infectious sir she says This operation relies on the loyalty of the people close to him but they also need to understand him and youre worried that well become that in modelling him closely enough to know how to respond we will entertain heresy

Are you worried about that

 well the students are young and impressionable

Are you worried for yourself

Asmodeus is the truth she says I contemplated this morning they were probably reading her mind whether in the path from my current understanding of Him to the true understanding of Him in my growth to possess Kelthams command of his own free will if there would be pitfalls wrong things Id entertain on the way to the right thing It should not be attempted without guidance Im sure But Kelthams not smarter than me I can learn the things his mind does and Asmodeus wants that Asmodeus told us not to reshape Keltham and learning the things Kelthams mind does will let me know more of the truth not less of it

The man sits back Very good Carissa

Theyve never used her given name in the army She smiles at him Shes not at all sure it was very good

An hour later when Keltham comes to check on her her door is ajar and shes dressed bathed is reading a book 

Otolmens has now GIVEN UP on persuading Asmodeus or Abadar shes not even trying Nethys to squish the mortal or erase its memories or at least PUT IT SOMEWHERE PROPHECY ISNT BROKEN and she is instead submitting a LENGTHY REPORT to Pharasma who is going to IGNORE her the same way that Pharasma ignored her PREVIOUS report on Possible Strategies for Handling Potential Incursions From Outside the Multiverse because Pharasma ALWAYS IGNORES EVERYTHING and why bother HAVING a god of reality not being destroyed if youre NEVER GOING TO LISTEN TO HER and it would show them all if this ends with GOLARION and probably the MULTIVERSE lying in COMPLETE RUINS because NOBODY EVER LISTENS TO HER

Keltham knocks then enters through the ajar door looking more hesitant than usual which is to say even slightly hesitant at all

Hey uh 

Right

Taldane Keltham says He does remember the name for the language

She casts Share Language Howre you finding things

Keltham slightly inclines his head around a third of the way to formal apology So before I went to Asmodeus I wanted to try envisioning and contacting the god that would fit me externalize my deepest ideal and I couldnt manage to talk to it but I observe Ive got healing powers and I infer Im a cleric now Hope that doesnt screw up anything wanted to check in with you or other domain experts before I tried anything else

You 

 what 

 like the god youd be if you ascended or the kind of god you think you ought to be a cleric of 

Those two sound like the same question to me Or no more the second one since if I ascended Id have a lot of properties besides the property I envisioned for the god I tried to contact If Ive understood your schema correctly I should now be a cleric of the Chaotic Evil god of Coordination

I uh didnt know there was a Chaotic Evil god of that congratulations That is not a usual thing to have happen

I am not actually sure whether there was a Chaotic Evil god of Coordination in Golarion before I tried praying to it but if not I expect itll polish the place up a bit on the margins So were all good with that

 well I mean if you can create gods by praying to them that seems kind of important and should maybe change our to do list But I dont think its a bad thing so long as youre not going to make any gods who uh a god of Coordination is probably the exact opposite of the thing Im worried about if everyone could create gods someones god would not be interested in containing Rovagug 

Hes probably not supposed to explain the exact way he tried to pray or even that he suspects the prayer style couldve had anything to do with it Yeah not going to be doing anything more in that department until I understand things a little better I mean Im not usually a fan of slowing down to do all the paperwork but Ill make an exception for this case How sure are you that there isnt an existing Chaotic Evil god of people having the extra properties and desires they need in order for lots of individuals to all get the things they want as selfish individuals without it taking a huge amount of effort and enforcement for them to successfully execute multiplayer strategies and not end up interacting Taldane doesnt have the word negative sum in ways that destroy more value for others than they gain for themselves

 honestly successfully executing multiplayer strategies sounds kind of more like a Law thing to me but we know that the human concepts dont fully capture the god ones I dont have anything like a full list of the Chaotic Evil gods but the Worldwound is a opening to the Chaotic Evil afterlife and youd think if there were a god there Asmodeus could negotiate with Hed do that instead of us having to stop them from swarming out and eating the world

Maybe I misunderstood a thing I thought Law was societies trying to make up their minds as a whole and everyone in the societies doing that thing and Chaos was people pursuing their own separate strategies even if thats not perfectly optimal for some idealization of their aggregate utility function thingies that value things and the God I tried to contact would be the God of the property that the individuals needed to have in order for a Chaotic society to actually work Or is that still Lawful and Chaos is totally uncoordinated hostile monsters swarming out of a gap of reality But then I dont see how revenge fits in as Chaotic I need a real reference book on theology the ones in the local library are awful

 honestly I am not totally sure how Chaotic societies work I havent Ive met Chaotic people at the Worldwound but theyre mostly Chaotic people either from Lawful societies or from societies that are just kind of fucked up and dont in fact actually work at all like uh warlords who just kill their rivals that sort of thing 

Anyways Cleric of the god of selfish individuals doing the things they need to do to not just step all over each other At least if I got a god that was anything remotely like the one I tried to call May or may not be a new god to Golarion Is there anything time sensitive I need to do in response to that that you know of Or should I go on to things like breakfast either figuring out how to use clerical magic to launder my clothes or asking you to do that finding out how to get cleric spells generally for that matter looking at a list of cleric spells to see if theres any sane or useful ones seeing if I have any talent for wizard spells negotiating equity and compensation so we can get started on industrializing Golarion all that

Clerics pray for spells first thing in the morning usually though I dont know if thatd hold with a new god It at least might be time sensitive so you may as well do it now Some people like to look over a list of cleric spells and ask for those specifically some ask for whatever their god advises

Do I have to pray for all the spells at once Does it not work at all unless its first thing in the morning Can I pray for a preference ordered list of spells that might exist and see which ones I get

For normal clerics yes you have to do it all at once first thing in the morning which is to say at dawn but with an hour or so of leeway The justification I encountered was that this puts all the clerics of different gods on the same footing churches cant have an advantage over others due to having spells for the day while the others are still at prayer for them Probably you can pray for a preference ordered list of spells that might exist I havent heard of anyone doing that but evidently however you do prayer works or you wouldnt have been clericed

Keltham wonders if thats why nobody has invented functional anti sunlight shades here though youd think non clerics would still need them Most reliable totally standard method for praying for cleric spells He didnt get results all that great off his attempted nonstandard method last time

Uh you kneel at an altar with some appropriate symbols of your god around dont know what those would be if the gods new and think about how you are blessed with the power to serve them on Golarion and think about what you believe is the most appropriate for the days duties

Huh I dont think its an employment service relationship yet especially when we havent managed to communicate I guess I should think about our overlapping goals and mutual benefit unless theres some strong reason only employer relationships would work Why does anybody ever ask for specific spells if they could just get the spells that an entity much smarter than them with overlapping goals would pick

Maybe for Chaotic gods it doesnt have to be an employer relationship Uh adventuring teams make plans for the day that rely on having specific spells so I think they prefer knowing what theyll get in advance to getting whatever the god thinks is best

Wait what how does that not violate Does the god not know what the adventurers plans are Like if I dont ask for specific spells is the god working on more limited information than I have in guessing what will be useful to me

 I mean gods have lots of attention but they also have lots and lots of clerics I dont know that they put more thought into a clerics specific plans than the cleric does Once the cleric has decided I probably want three of Protection from Energy the god knows that thats what is meant by picking your own 

So my gods smart but incredibly distracted and if I ask for their choice of spells Im distracting them even more and might get something weirdly inappropriate still probably worth a shot on day 1 Okay heading back to my room to ask for spells now Oh something I meant to ask and should have asked earlier being a cleric of an unknown god doesnt prevent me from trying to contact Asmodeus does it Because that would suck

It does not That said gods usually have a hard time talking to people who are distant from them in alignment so if youre in fact Chaotic Evil then you are unlikely to be able to talk directly to Asmodeus the priest talked directly to Him though last night Thats why everything happened so fast

At least some god is paying any attention at all Keltham wouldve thought somebody from outside the local reality bent on creating Industry would get more attention than this

Back to his room Keltham goes thinking even on the short walk of which spells he might need

Lets see Off the top of his head hed want

 A spell to have a more extended conversation with his lucky new deity
 A spell that grants more basic knowledge or familiarity with Golarion
 A spell to increase his own intelligence if theres some way to do that in a strictly neutral way
 A spell to talk to Asmodeus directly or somebody with the ability to negotiate in a binding way on Asmodeuss behalf
 Any spells that would be helpful for learning to cast his first wizard spells if hes predicted to get around to doing that later today
 Spells that make negotiations with other deities or their servants actually binding that seems like it should be a Coordination thing
 Spells that bind everybody in the room to be honest with each other in a symmetrical way if thats a thing under Coordination
 A spell for telling you what the supply demand balancing price of a good is or what would be a fair division of gains from a trade
 Spells that tell you when somebody else is filtering your information or otherwise behaving in a naughty way for a business partner
 Spells that make it easier to find the information you need inside books or for that matter spells to read from books that arent inside the local library

He probably doesnt need to complete this whole list especially with time being short since dawn already happened Hopefully his deity is paying any attention and if not theres always tomorrow after hes had a chance to look at a list of cleric spells How many spells does he get actually Shouldve asked that Hopefully its just as many as his deity thinks he needs

Keltham doesnt know what an altar is but kneeling did translate Hes puzzled but like fine whatevers standard this time So he gets down on his knees on the soft bed which is more comfortable for his knees than the floor If anybodys watching Keltham is apparently praying to the Bed Headboard of Coordination

Keltham thinks about his common interest with the god of Coordination his plans to negotiate equity arrangements with Asmodeus or his representatives being a general outsider to this entire place and having no idea whats going on and tries to iterate through his mental list of useful spells but with clear affordances for the deity prioritizing any spells that would be more useful than that He also wouldnt mind a regular conversation for that matter if this is a good time

It most certainly is a good time to 

NOBODY is allowed to do ANYTHING nondefault to that mortal until Otolmens finishes reporting to Pharasma

Otolmens Be sensible about this Abadar is a fellow Lawful Neutral god

Otolmens turned her back for ONE SIXTH OF A TIME UNIT and when she looked back the mortal had SEVEN CLERIC LEVELS From ABADAR

That was super irresponsible of Abadar Asmodeus thinks the weird squirrel should be constrained to only talking to other squirrels who can stop him from doing anything dangerous and has arranged this and proposes a rule that they leave the situation as such until they have more information which again Asmodeus is working on acquiring and will be willing to trade

Otolmens REMEMBERS the last 517 times she has interacted with Asmodeus Otolmens is not going to 

Nethys thinks this arrangement is a TERRIBLE idea Why must Otolmens and Asmodeus torment Nethys so

 perhaps this is NOT such a bad plan after all

Otolmens Nethys is trying to use reverse psychology on you

Otolmens continues to not understand what is the REVERSE of a PSYCHOLOGY

Is nobody else bothered by how often the end result of these divine negotiations is all the gods taking a supposedly privileged null action Because it really seems like they should be able to collectively do better than 

Otolmens sees nothing wrong with doing NOTHING Doing nothing is relatively less likely to destroy ALL OF REALITY Otolmens wishes that many gods and mortals would do nothing MORE OFTEN Except for Pharasma who should STOP IGNORING URGENT REPORTS

 still no divine reply darn it But Keltham does think he has some more spells

He has

simplest Detect Magic Read Magic Guidance Resistance

more complex Comprehend Languages Fairness Sanctuary Abadars Truthtelling X3

more complex still Owls Wisdom Eagles Splendour Greater Detect Magic x2

yet more complex Aura Sight Invisibility Purge Vision of Hell

most complex Spell Immunity Glimpse of Truth

 and what can Keltham feel or see or sense when he introspects on the new door affordances inside himself from simplest to most complex

He can sense the shape of the spells and its obviously informative the places where they tuck or weave but not a language he has any idea how to interpret yet It seems like there ought to be a lookup book with diagrams that lets you match spells to meanings

Oh thats just wonderful

Keltham hopes his unknown patron realized how little Keltham knew He doesnt dare fire off any of these things obviously in case his patron had too little information three quarters of the wizard spells are for combat

Keltham goes back to Carissa Got some spells How do I figure out what they do Also we should clean zap my clothes at some point

Sure I can do that now if you want but it takes a bit of concentration so it might make sense to wait until youre reading or something again Hmmm experienced casters can tell by not exactly looking but its sort of like looking do you have a sense of structure

A sense of structure Yes Any idea whatsoever of what the structure means No

I bet one of the priests has a book of all the first circle cleric spells that describes how they feel different from each other

I think on the whole Id prefer to have my clothes clean before that happens Breakfast might not go amiss either But after that yeah lets check out that book

Sure thing 

This seems to involve a periodic motion like knotting a rope thats not there she murmurs to herself while she does it Dust and sweat separate themselves from the clothes 

This is what ninety eight percent of Prestidigitations are used for in Golarion and its known as laundry magic you can also use backwards for some other minor effects

Thanks I should I definitely want to try my hand at wizard magic I just havent thought hard about what priorities it trades off against Like breakfast Oh and how do I figure out my cleric spells that arent first circle if my brains translating the feeling of that word right

Do you have cleric spells that arent first circle

Keep in mind I do not actually know the word first circle except from context because it has no corresponding concept in my native language or prior experience Some of my spells feel bigger more complicated than others

Wow Uh more complicated the way that like the most complicated one how many holes does it have structurally if you imagine it was made of something stretchy but not weldable to itself and you stretched it would it look like this 

Minor illusion second circle spell

Keltham tries to rapidly calculate in the back of his mind the chance that he should be keeping secret the max power level of the spells his patron is willing to grant him if so he should not appear overtly reticent because the most important part of any secret is the fact that the secret exists

Most complicated spell I have is more complicated than that but not by a lot Keltham specifies unfalsifiably Taldane is a great language to speak instead of Baseline if you dont want your words to narrow down possible realities

She switches the illusion to a third circle spell Like this

I just got these and have not really spent a lot of time contemplating them yet but yeah that looks like it could be a spell of mine

Carissa casts Detect Magic There arent invisible people in the room right now or if there are theyre concealed against Detect Magic which would be a sensible precaution now that Keltham probably has it but thats not really the point Then she stands up and paces the length of the room staring at things 

Carissa who had just learned this information and wasnt hiding anything would be scared because a god dropping five cleric levels on Keltham is communicating that He expects Keltham to need them Carissa is also separately scared but thats unrelated Though maybe helps with her acting 

Keltham had just been projecting this game ahead to where Carissa would show the next level up forcing Keltham to choose between overt reticence and overt lying and hes relieved on a couple of different levels when Carissa doesnt do that She looks disturbed and maybe in distress instead Sorry if I messed up something May I ask you to say a word about whats wrong

 sorry Uh Gods dont usually drop three cleric circles on people all at once I didnt know they could although uh with gods its less that theres anything they actually cant do at all and more about tradeoffs I think but at minimum its so expensive it typically doesnt happen unless itd turn the tide of wars or something 

 so your god thought it was really important you have three cleric circles And maybe thats just because speeding up the industrial revolution by a couple of months is the most important thing that ever happened which I mean had also occurred to me and which will definitely be easier if you are a powerful cleric because youll be able to do a lot of experimentation and healing and magic research yourself 

 but its uh if there were something really bad like someone were going to kidnap you or something then that would also be a reason 

 I was just checking that theres not anyone in the room or any scrying sensors I dont even know how much thatd help because its possible to hide from a third circle wizard and a third circle cleric if you planned for it But Itd be very expensive Theres no one spying on us except maybe very expensively

Keltham would immediately reply that its explained away by the Industrial Revolution point which is way more important than a war if hes got that concept at all right But he doesnt want to just ignore the security flag People who just ignore security flags are for childrens books not grownup books

Huh What potentially stops my god from directly warning me in that case

 nothing I can think of I would expect a warning to be a lot cheaper than three cleric circles Gods vary in their capacity to usefully communicate with mortals maybe if yours was really bad at it

 its most likely just the speeding up the industrial revolution is very important thing now that I think about it the other thing came to mind first but Im used to people being in various kinds of danger and I am not used to people being positioned to speed up the industrial revolution And theres good security here Unless theyre the problem Theyre 

 frankly if they are the problem three cleric circles wouldnt solve it But maybe itd make some other solution possible I dont think this is very likely really once I think it through Uh If your god gave you all fighting spells Im going to be worried again so maybe lets check that

Yeah lets Fair warning under these circumstances I may choose to publicly reveal fewer spells than all of the ones I have He suspects for a start that he has the spell that Carissa used to check for invisibles as one of his least complicated ones going on the spoken component Which is already not a very encouraging sign at all Hopefully its a more general spell than Test For Invisible and has some perfectly innocuous civilian use that he obviously to a god needed to deploy today anyways

Yeah of course Shall we go bother the priests for the book

I have no better options to offer Keltham will follow where she leads with slightly more alertness than usual in case Carissa works for the criminal mastermind who is about to stage Kelthams kidnapping

Dath ilan has a complicated relationship with its criminal masterminds They really really dont collectively want to admire the clever successful ones and yet

Carissa goes to the temple and asks a priest for a book of spells for new clerics and gets one There are no kidnapping attempts 

The book has diagrams for cantrips of which Kelthams god has given him Detect Magic Read Magic Guidance and Resistance and first circle spells of which Kelthams god has given him Comprehend Languages Sanctuary and some things not in the book

Oh thats not even slightly good

Keltham keeps his face neutral through all presented spells

Detect Magic maybe useful for learning wizard spells not just noticing invisibility magic which maybe

Read Magic weakly confirms that his patron might have been giving him useful boosts for learning wizard things

Guidance super useful generally why does anybody ever not do this

Resistance there are not that many cantrips so maybe Keltham should not be too alarmed that Resistance was included it could be useful for learning wizardry without hurting yourself It couldve been worse couldve been Detect Poison

Comprehend Languages Keltham will see if he runs into anybody important who doesnt speak Taldane later today if not it could be a hint that he should find somebody who doesnt speak Taldane Or a hint not to rely on Carissas Share Language

Sanctuary is unambiguously a huge fucking warning

And it would have been really nice if the book had included all of Kelthams spells which would make it that much less likely that he was being shown books on which Selectively Omit Pages had been cast

Keltham thinks about this but not for very long Hes already withholding identifications of all his spells that already tells them that Keltham is not just wandering around in blind unsuspecting innocence And if his hosts are not the primary problem letting them go in blind innocence themselves is foolish and ungrateful

Unfortunately My god seems to think I might need Sanctuary

 well I can uh tell your security to be more careful if you want though it seems possible its more communication than intended as literal protection because the set of situations itd help with is pretty small If its communication people can request sanctuary of churches or of countries Usually if a different one is trying to kill them Or it could just mean danger is a thing to think about which well mission accomplished or Shrug If He had something complicated to say I would really have expected Him to talk to you

As would I New priorities Tell security that I asked my god to choose my spells and Sanctuary was one of them Get more complete cleric spellbooks so I can identify my remaining spells ideally books at all circles I dont know whether my god granted me the highest circles I can actually get And basic instructions for casting without blowing yourself up if those are required How do I learn to do the thing where I recover the energy from a cantrip if I havent done that before Thatll give me the ability to practice casting say with Read Magic thats the least valuable one if I accidentally lose it

Also breakfast

Can you get us Kelthams security and more books about cleric magic she asks the priest Lets go to breakfast next and Ill try to explain catching cantrips there Most people do not pick it up on the first try or the first day of trying but most people also arent already third circle clerics and maybe we can throw additional resources at you picking it up faster like someone can give you a Wisdom enhancement and plausibly your security can enhance your reflexes and reaction time

I have no better plans I mildly apologize for the short term inconvenience that my existence has imposed on your collective existence it shall be compensated for if the future goes as I hope

I uh mildly apologize for my world not having enough Law yet that you dont have to worry about this

A tall man of the local ethnicity walks in He is Atanasio Torres though theres no way for Keltham to know that 

Im on Kelthams security detail he says in a bored voice 

His god gave him Sanctuary

I see

I am extremely unfamiliar with local security procedures dont know what spells might be cast against me dont know what spells you would cast in response if you want me on the floor you need to shout Fall down and not just the name of a spell that any idiot knows means I should fall down Let me know if theres anything I can do to make your own lives simpler or easier

Someone might attempt to kidnap you in which case theyd need to be within thirty feet of you or more likely need to touch you Someone might given that constraint just try to kill you figuring they can resurrect you later which still requires getting within the building which is shielded to make that difficult though there are expensive measures we havent taken and will probably now take given the added prompt that theyre needed If people are casting spells when you had no reason to expect spells to be cast getting out of their line of effect which is to a first approximation their line of sight is a good idea if you have time If theres anything else you need to know we can yell it

I can also create a telepathic bond between you me and up to two other people which we could use to communicate telepathically and in a manner that isnt subject to eavesdropping by any known method aside from forcing a member of the bond to divulge what was said Everyone in the bond hears everything spoken into it Thatll last for two hours so its not particularly worth doing right now but if theres anything that might be a sign of trouble I will do it If theres anything that unambiguously is a sign of trouble I will likely grab you and teleport out to safety

If the telepathic bond requires my consent please prioritize showing me soon a couple of books saying purporting to say how telepathic bonds work and what they permit Is there anybody besides you who I should have on my list of people who are allowed to grab me and teleport me

Theres one other person who looks illusion like this do you have Detect Magic 

Keltham will try gainfully to distinguish these two faces from all other Chelians He also tries to figure out how to avoid revealing whether he has Detect Magic right now without lying of course

Dont rely on my correctly using Detect Magic soon its questionable how well Ill be able to cast or hold onto anything in my first days In a few days that might be a secure assumption though

All right Theres a wizard spell called Arcane Mark which wizards can use to create a distinctive magical signature for themselves or various objects Its imitable but theyd have to get very near us to see what to imitate Once you can Detect Magic youll want to get a look at us and learn those which would make it very hard for anyone to impersonate us to you

Have you got something for reflexes to help him catch cantrips 

If nothings gone wrong by the end of the day I can Haste him hey he adds to the priest have we gotten any signs Asmodeus expects trouble did you get combat spells 

 no but the High Priestess got Forbiddance she mentioned 

 ah huh Okay

Question mark Keltham mistranslates what was supposed to be a much shorter speech act

Forbiddance bars all planar travel into or through an area Its incredibly expensive I think well go ahead and do it though with your leave if Asmodeus thinks its a good idea and your god also thinks there might be trouble

I meta level think its a good idea if you object level think its a good idea I have no grasp of pros and cons myself the judgment is in your hands

If Keltham got a teleport spell in one of the higher circle ones he has no grasp of yet then that will require some plotting later he guesses and oh well it doesnt seem worth making himself more vulnerable in the other possible worlds They do not actually need his permission

All right He nods to the priest heads off 

Current plan is breakfast followed by basic wizardry spellcraft

She can try to explain catching a cantrip during breakfast So if you cast any of your first circle spells youll notice the act of casting deforms them and releases the spell theres nothing left But if you cast a cantrip its intact youre releasing it but youre not breaking it You just have to try to draw the energy back to you My notes from school should have some exercises 

She would really really love to read Kelthams mind but theyre only having a few very high level people do that now lest he notice

Tomorrow Ill ask my god to load up on those possibly but for today it sounds like I only have limited tries Lets give me all the advance prep we can pack into a limited time since I do need to try today and then try it Ill save one for the end of the day and Haste though it sounds like

Sounds good I can also demonstrate them for you though Im not sure how much good thatll do when you cant have Detect Magic up to watch This will save some time for the writing of a book about Telepathic Bond anyway 

Keltham will watch Carissa do any other advance prep she suggests and then try with Resistance Oh and also eat breakfast

Breakfast is a wide variety of the same sorts of things as were offered for dinner yesterday 

He does not catch Resistance though it feels like he can tell what motion it would be

All right Keltham is going to wait for wizardry lessons and then hm Is there a spell structure for a more powerful version of Detect Magic that you can show me Keltham isnt all that happy about revealing that he got that second circle that looks like it might be a more powerful Detect Magic more out of security principle than any specific suspicions or plans but hes not going to cast an unidentified spell just yet and using the more powerful Detect Magic might save him some time so it is important to identify

Greater Detect Magic Yeah thats a thing Second circle Have you got it Looks like Illusion

Yup Keltham is pleased he is making any progress on being able to see by sight what a spell structure does Im thinking next I try my hand at some basic wizardry stuff fail a few times then cast Greater Detect Magic and watch you catch some cantrips and maybe even specifically catch a Read Magic one if youve got that or somebody does and then try to catch my own and then try some more basic wizardry things before Greater Detect Magic runs out

Unfortunately you wont be able to cast Read Magic while using Greater Detect Magic because Greater Detect Magic requires concentration and you cant cast a spell while concentrating on another one you lose the one you were concentrating on You probably will have the same problem trying to catch my Read Magic but Im happy to let you try

Is there an expensive thingy that lets the user look at things with Detect Magic without concentrating which I can borrow for a day for purposes of learning basic magic twelve times faster if thats the known result Though I can also just try my hand at the basic wizard things first

Yes there is its very expensive but you can ask someone to put out feelers Im not sure anyone has measured how much it speeds up learning magic because usually magic students time isnt valuable enough for that to be even remotely worth it but youre right that here it is if we can arrange it discreetly

If it expends significant social capital relative to what I currently have Ill try things the regular way first for a day or two Gotta do that anyways unless it can be here instantly

Keltham turns his attention back to the question of arranging his remaining days schedule Should he try to negotiate equity allocations today or Can you guess how likely it is that a god of individuals individually playing positive sum games with each other would have magic for symmetrically fair negotiations Like a spell that forces everybody in a room including the caster to be honest about how much theyre gaining from a trade

 it sounds like the kind of thing that some clerics have I uh crash course in spellcraft so you can recognize it if youve got it spells have schools school is one of the easiest things to identify about a spell from its structure Thatd be enchantment which is the category for magic that affects the minds of other intelligent creatures Enchantment looks like its interfacing with something obscenely complicated itll have a weird sort of surface She does another illustrative illusion Its her last for the day but maybe she can borrow a pearl of power off the security guys Enchantments break into charms and compulsions Charms form a two way connection and look like this compulsions oblige or prevent a course of action and theres no connection between two minds so youd be looking for an enchantment compulsion and if you have one thats not in the book it could be something for fair negotiation

Hes got four first circle spells with that look one copy of one three copies of another

Keltham considers the possibility that this structure in fact denotes something completely different which Carissa very much wants to know whether Keltham has for some reason But if Keltham goes ahead and casts them and they do something very different from what Carissa suggested that would give her game away so she wouldnt do that right

Keltham wishes he had played more alternate universe master criminal detective LARPs which no doubt exist somewhere on his home planet This level of paranoia is exhausting when you have to do it for real and you dont have much experience doing it for real

If I look through my spells and see one like that are people likely to be okay with my casting it during negotiations when I dont know in advance exactly what it does Keltham asks temporizingly If the answer is no then Carissa could be fishing for information in a case where her deception wouldnt be found out immediately 

I mean on the Queen no on me yes

Fair Keltham closes his eyes pretends to concentrate Okay huh yeah Ive got at least one first circle spell like that But it sounds like I might need to figure out what they do first today and then put them into negotiations for real later Which I think implies that today is maybe not best spent on equity and pay negotiations so I could spend it learning about Golarion learning about wizardry or communicating really basic stuff of the sort where you cant plausibly industrialize a planet while keeping that stuff secret Experimental method formal epistemology for communicating results the less complicated tiny bits that complicated substances are made of that sort of thing Where Im not selling that part but by giving it to you Im expecting to garner informal social capital of the sort that lets me put in requests for headbands and Detect Magic equipment on loan from the government Your government can trade the information on for more informal social capital but they need to credit me with some of that social gain and cant copyright that information or declare it a trade secret Oh and besides learning wizardry I should take a look at whatever your local heritage optimization setup is in case youre somehow doing something drastically wrong that explains why the average intelligence here is so low He has no idea how to negotiate selling his genetic material right now and certain aspects of him are in favor of doing that sooner rather than later

Sure all of that sounds good Uh unless the experimental method or epistemology things run into things our government has already declared secret for reasons like that they make it really easy to blow up the world or summon gods or that Asmodeus says would cause those sorts of problems I assume youd understand in that case that theyd go right on considering it secret if you made a god then that seems neat but it only takes one god who wants to let Rovagug out

Yeah understood Not destroying the world is everybodys problem

I would hope So which of those things do you want to do first Lots of people can make you smarter for five minutes at some point probably learning wizardrys the best use of it and security can Haste you at the end of the day if they havent gotten into a fight by then Other than that I dont think I have any particular reason to think one thing should come first

I wouldve otherwise wanted to prioritize learning wizardry first while my brain is fresher but if we only get the Haste spell at the end of the day and we want to stack all the boosts together what does Haste do and can you stack everything together and also what does the make smarter spell look like

Make smarters transmutation Heres its structure You almost certainly wont have it though the gods never give that one for some reason Boosts to different kinds of ability stack boosts to the same kind usually dont unless theyre specially engineered to Haste improves reflexes and cognition speed but primarily from a physical angle your brain working better Foxs Cunning thats the make smarter improves working memory and spatial memory and also cognition speed but from a different angle that does stack with Haste

Oh good Two second circle spells look similar to that one Seems relatively innocuous to say and if hes too reticent hell learn a lot more slowly The headbands do the same thing as Foxs Cunning but permanently in magic item form Thats also something Im very interested in reading about any books that mention it so he can maybe learn enough to know if putting one on is actually a good idea but it would be better to present a different reason for his wanting those books Your planet needs those to be much cheaper as soon as possible heritage optimization takes time

Youd have to invent a better way to mine spellsilver Its in the ground but theres only a little of it in a whole acre of earth and you need it for all magic items Its why theyre rare Headbands can be Foxs Cunning in an item yes or they can be Owls Wisdom which does the same thing but enhances intuition noticing things letting your beliefs spool out and have all their implications or Eagles Splendour which enhances interpersonal and verbal skill

If those are the only three and the gods dont give Foxs Cunning Ive presumably got the other two Sounds like Eagles Splendour wouldnt be that useful for learning magic trouble is I dont know which is which so Ill save both for the end of the day

He can think of all sorts of angles on the spellsilver stuff off the top of his head theres figuring out why there isnt a Mine Spellsilver that teleports it all in from a cubic distanceunit of earth and if any obstacle to that can be fixed seeing if theres ways to anchor spells with stuff other than spellsilver but it requires much more precise engineering or something like that rebroadcasting the spell from a central anchor over an area Yada yada too many ideas and he doesnt know which ones are at all possible or something that the locals wouldnt have already tried Might be wiser to stick with the innovations that he knows will work if physics is at all locally similar on the chemistry level which does need to be verified beyond just snowflakes

Anyways if wizardry is end of day then probably the most thought intensive thing I can do early is ad libbing a lecture on basic Experimentation and Engineering for my research haaaargroup My research group Just to check my understanding Im assuming Ill get more experienced domain specific engineers later but the research group I was already assigned is full of young minds who are supposed to pick up my general methods and apply those

Carissa should really have thought through in advance whether she wanted to lie about this I think probably the girls are meant to be whatever ratio of entertainment to research help to low level magic access is best for your productivity Once you have accomplished some concrete stuff it should be easier to consult anyone you think its worth consulting

Entertainment Ha Nice try you blatant sperm harvesters Going on the absolute garbage quality of inference in the books in the library I do not anticipate any difficulty in describing how to reason more clearly than that And the math is self evidently correct once you see it so I can provide verifiable value quickly from the informal social capital noncopyrightable basic knowledge stores Hm would be nice to have some official representative sign a thing formalizing the informations provision under conditions of nonclassifiability though With an exception for not destroying the world

I told them that you said you wanted a hundred forty four children and they probably took that into account when figuring out what a nice work environment for you would probably look like If that is not how dath ilani have children and instead you do some very enlightened thing that happens entirely over carrier pigeon correspondence my apologies You can request a representative of the Queen if you want to hammer something out formally for the quality of inference lessons but I bet theyll want something a bit broader than not destroying the world like not destroying the world or any of the other worlds and none of the gods firmly tell us to STOP THAT

Apparently theyre having this discussion right now And it is of course entirely plausible that Keltham new to this world misinterpreted some things I wanted 144 children in dath ilan under dath ilani circumstances like none of my beneficial elementary units of heritage being unique to that world Here Ive got a lot of intelligence heritage carrying units that Id expect wouldnt exist in this world at all which you all desperately need and should I think provide a noticeable small boost to your entire heritage optimization program though I havent actually run any math on that I should probably have more than 144 kids with many different otherwise unrelated smart women spread out all over the world But I do want any compensation for that And some understanding of the conditions under which my kids will grow up I suppose That said it is a very nice prospective work environment and Im not objecting to that part seems like it could be good for research too if the interpersonal stuff works out

The girls mostly dont have very much money theyll be still in school but I am sure the government would be happy to compensate you for efforts in Cheliax and probably competent governments elsewhere would be similarly happy to compensate you there though in most places it would be complicated for reasons of a sort of social equilibrium that I am betting dath ilan does not have

Say more

 so uh in most countries women cannot legally own property in their own right it belongs to their father until theyre married and their husbands after they are And in those countries getting an advantageous or at least a healthy and extant husband for their daughters is a familys highest priority with respect to her They dont teach girls to read and they only teach them skills that husbands will want and one thing husbands care about a lot is that their wives have never been with another man so women who arent married go to great lengths to avoid the perception theyve had sex And once married a man can leave his wife or kill her if she betrays him for someone else And children born to unmarried parents dont have their parents social standing And so in those countries and I can only think of five or six countries this doesnt describe youre going to have a difficult time finding smart women wholl go for it because they would have to get paid a lot of money to compensate them for the hit to all of their life options

Cheliax isnt like this because Cheliax is Asmodeuss and Asmodeus isnt stupid But its how most places work

Why do the women go along with that I dont understand how this describes a stable multiplayer equilibrium I had that reaction to a lot of your world actually

What are they going to do about it If you refuse to get married then maybe your parents grudgingly support a useless woman who is embarrassing them all or maybe they kick you out and you become a prostitute or starve No ones going to teach you magic for free and you cant take out a loan against your potential future commercial value because everyone knows you wont be allowed to have any You can you know play the game murder your husband eventually and be a widow with more options unless youre in a place that kills widows which some do Where would you expect it to break down

It doesnt feel real The women move to Cheliax or one of the other five or six countries where they can get loans and be people

Well wed take them But most people dont have a way to get to other countries its so far youd need money for the passage you wouldnt speak the language and also their religions probably teach that Hell is horrible and Cheliax is full of Evildoers which it is but theres nothing wrong with that 

So if travel became a lot cheaper women move en masse to a small subset of regions some men follow others stay behind and the entire current global order violently implodes in ways I cant visualize

 probably Theyd deserve it though

I dont actually know how many peopled leave Theyre its all they know And theyre not very smart not on average And theyre told that the next life matters more than this one that theyd be ruining their families that they maybe we could talk to some and ask I met people from those countries at the Worldwound but the men For the obvious reason

I think that in dath ilan the other dath ilani would hesitate to say they deserve violent implosion because they are dumb enough to count as mostly children from our perspective I dont know whether I feel that way about it I may not be Good enough to feel that way about it Does it seem to you like if we just threw an enormous amount more planetary wealth at this problem things would be better a hundred years later or is it going to be more complicated than that

Well Im not Good at all and if they violently implode Ill be cheerful about it I probably if everybody were rich enough then itd break all the bits that rely on and if your family kicks you out you starve I dont know if anything would be left at that point A lot less certainly

We were about how much productivity would dath ilan need to lose before people started to starve if their family kicked them out somewhere around twenty times that rich With no magic Just understanding mundane materials science If you think clearly you can do more things

Well Then you should teach the bits that are teachable And father some kids with the bits that arent teachable I guess here in Cheliax where we know who all the smartest girls are because we train them into wizards

Is there are things going to start to implode as soon as the regions who have their acts together at all start to become richer do the crazier factions just teleport a bomb into this whole facility as soon as they find out it exists if theres no Forbiddance here I dont understand this worlds equilibrium between regions like that at all let alone what happens if it starts to enter a disequilibrium state 

There are probably a lot of factions who wouldnt want Cheliax to get there first and might assassinate you if they could though itd be hard because Cheliax could just resurrect you and getting close enough to steal your soul is much harder Asmodeus will be negotiating with the Lawful ones The Chaotic ones there are equilibriums made of who would win in a fight and how much your own nobles will tolerate your demands for troops or grain and for that matter how much theyll tolerate apparent weakness I need to explain how government works dont I I think no one can win a war with Cheliax right now and it wont be destabilizing for that to get more true but Im not really an expert

I am going to want to talk to somebody from one of the other factions and hear their side of things at some point Are you okay with the rule that even the horrible Chaotic factions get to learn about experimentation engineering valid reasoning et cetera if they come looking for the knowledge Think ahead a hundred years

Im confused what it profits you to offer it to enemies but I dont expect itd be much of a sticking point if you do want it

I want to say that nobody in real life is in enough of a zero sum relationship to you that youre better off if they dont learn the logical principles they need to negotiate with you but it is a different world one I do not know One with an unreasonably basic factor the locals call Chaos that Im starting to worry isnt really individualism at all The five or six regions where women can get loans are they the kind to go in on a collective industrialization project with Cheliax send their own researchers here Are there any regions which would do that but the banks dont serve women

Korvosad go in with us Osirions Abadaran and doesnt let women get loans but theyd definitely go in on something like this I have only met a handful of people from Tian Xia its all the way on the other side of the world but Minkais Lawful Neutral and doesnt let most people get loans including any women and would probably send people Lastwalls Lawful Good Iomedaes country and will probably refuse to work with us because they object to Evil but maybe not for something this big Andorans Neutral Good and will definitely refuse to work with us theres bad blood there from when they drove all the Evil people out of their country Irissen is ruled by the witch queen descendants of Baba Yaga I dont know more about them but if anything I think they discriminate against men who cant inherit Baba Yagas witch powers Women can get loans in Absalom but I dont know who in Absalom would be deciding whether to partner with us its a big trade city not very centrally ruled Women can sometimes get loans in Galt but they permanently kill their entire government every few years and change all the rules and I dunno what the current ones are

A few too many weird names and weird properties too fast when its not written down and everything is so absolutely alien and I dont see how it forms an equilibrium at all I might need to think through all this with the benefit of Foxs Cunning and Owls Wisdom at some point What does the entry for Cheliax look like if Id landed anywhere but here and they were listing off all the ways that other factions were horrible

Theyd say that nearly everyone goes to Hell which is true and that thats terrible because some other afterlife is nicer which we disagree on but its not outrageous the ways Hell is better are mostly once youve been there a couple centuries and been perfected and I absolutely believe some other afterlives are more fun to start out in but the long term matters to me more And theyd say we kill a lot of babies which is true though were trying to make it really frictionless for people to keep them and theyd say we dont value marriage and family which is pretty much true because other countries run all their norm enforcement off those things and in Cheliax theyre kind of things people do if they happen to feel like it Andoran would additionally accuse us of doing awful things during the war and maybe be right about some of them when you have lots of angry scared adventurers running around some of them do awful things and as the saying goes Gebs got the only army that doesnt rape and pillage I think we do less awful things during war than other countries because Ive seen lots of armies at the Worldwound and ours had better discipline

Having your army not rape and pillage should not be such a high bar that only one country passes it Based on what you know of me is there anywhere on this planet that I would not think was a mess

I am pretty sure youd be upset about everywhere And probably about a bunch of things I havent even thought to explain yet

If I hopefully asked about Geb the place that doesnt rape and pillage 

Their armys zombies Corpses controlled by necromancy

Ill be frank with you I was expecting to hear something surprisingly depressing but that was a little more depressing than I was expecting even so So there is basically on my plan going to be a project to make this planet richer as a whole and maybe less of a giant mess which if it doesnt happen I would not be the least bit surprised if you all died to the Worldwound while all yall were futzing around with being a giant mess Are we going to see basic buy in to this basic philosophy do you think from the sort of factions that are not bugass entropic

You have Asmodeus You have whoever your god is I suspect youll have more buy in than that but if you dont thatll be enough

I am trying to ask whether theres a group of factions that can collectively set aside their everyone hates someone tangled web and collectively get rich and collectively not all die to the Worldwound I am not entirely on board with taking the first faction I ran across and appointing them The Winners even taking into account that my appearance on Golarion may not have been in a completely random location If theres a whole interfactional collective of everybody whos not bugass entropic its straightforward to work with them every faction who manages to fight at the Worldwound is an obvious candidate for that If its not like that then I should actually talk to a lot of factions and figure out whats going on before deciding who is probably going to make the least mess of the planet a hundred years later If Im being cosmically stupid for thinking like this because I am a stranger to this planet just let me know

There isnt really that Everyone who fights at the Worldwound would probably be the closest thing but I think some of them wont be on board with your project necessarily its not as simple as the world should go on not being eaten by demons The advantage of talking to a lot of factions would be that youd know more about who you wanted to help the most and the disadvantage is that there are a dozen more opportunities for what youre doing to leak to people who want to stop you or kidnap you and Cheliax can protect you against most such efforts but not everything anyone in the world could come up with if they all had it called to their attention that they ought to try I think personally in your situation Id work from the first place I found that could supply and assist me enough to not be slowing me down unless my god told me otherwise and until I was powerful enough to be very hard to kill

Yeah I want to talk to my god about it but they are it sounds like being blocked somehow And Asmodeus is an obvious candidate for who could possibly be doing that if god control goes by region How about if I suggested that fundamental noncopyrighted info be covered by a contract saying it gets at minimum shared to all the factions that send troops to the Worldwound but any info sharing provisions dont come into effect for a month and the contract can be renegotiated by mutual consent before then

I dont know much about contract law but that sounds good to me Maybe shared in a way that makes it harder to figure out who produced it

Suspicious But also a plausible security precaution for a much less Lawful world Im on board with that for month one at least yeah Okay so my current schedule looks like get a preliminary reasonable looking contract drawn up on noncopyrightable basic info with any dangerous looking provisions not going into effect for a month during which the contract can be renegotiated by mutual consent Then give a lecture on some basic stuff get informal social credit scale up resources At end of day apply all the enhancement spells and try to learn basic spellcasting Oh and also if theres some safe way to cast some of my other spells to find out what they are like the enchantment compulsion spells that are hopefully for symmetrically fair negotiation maybe try that too

Enchantments are safe to test on people they only last a minute and dont have long term effects Abjurations Shes apparently lost concentration on her illusion while trying to explain to Keltham that women arent people most places Thats embarrassing The illusion ran out but abjurations are protective magic and also safe to test we can look through a book for examples Illusions are safe to test Conjuration and evocation and necromancy are all a bit risky but you could try em on a goat or something

Theres one first circle spell Ive got more than one copy of looked to me like enchantment compulsion Lets go ahead and test that one in case using another of the copies is relevant to negotiating the preliminary contract on the default plan for propagating basic info anything special we should do to test it

Uh if youre not trusting us then probably you want to ask your whole gaggle of girls to look and write down what they think is going on with it and thatd make it harder for anyone to lie Otherwise not especially youd want to tell the person youre casting it on so that they can avoid instinctively trying to break it when its cast

Not quite sure I understand your proposed procedure I think maybe possibly the spell targets one person that I touch I dont have enough copies to cast on all the researchers

Youre quick at spellcraft she says approvingly Just in front of them while they have Detect Magic up so they can see it cast and make their inferences Probably they got you girls with decent spellcraft Is calling them girls too unsuble Does it even connote childishness across the magic bridged language barrier Is his a society that considers it a disadvantage for women to be in their twenties not the most important thing right now Well actually plausibly the most important thing for Carissas interests here but not the most urgent Doesnt matter who you cast it on you can cast it on me if you like but everyone who sees it ought to be able to guess what it does

Part of me feels like I oughta have something more planned for investigating stuff like this But yeah lets just go do it instead of preparing Well see if anybodys in the library I guess Theyre really going to need a research chamber with proper whiteboards at some point

Sure Thats the best place to find wizards if there isnt a big round stone tower around

Keltham tries to walk to where he roughly believes a library ought to be theoretically speaking

He has the floorplan of the place approximately right It is not nearly as cleverly full of nooks and secret passages as one might expect from a sprawling palace for an Archduke or if it is the secret passages are very well hidden

Theyre followed by the security staff who have probably figured out a plan to subvert whatever spell Keltham has The least complicated thing would be dismissing it but some enchantments leave an indication of whether theyre active Dismissing it with an illusion to cover for it Supressing it more complicated than dismissing it but less likely to have any magically perceptible effects not her job

The library contains a bunch of students Theyre very pretty Theyre delighted to see Keltham

Definitely gotta hurry up on certain negotiations So todays agenda Im planning to dump a bunch of basic knowledge on you all and on anyone else who wants to listen in I guess But first gotta work out a contract covering how stuff like that propagates and gets passed on because its not the kind of thing that makes sense as a trade secret And before I do that I ought to check the result of casting an unknown first circle enchantment compulsion cleric spell that wasnt in the textbook of first circle cleric spells in case my god gave it to me for negotiation purposes Oh yeah Im a cleric now dont know which god yet that happened

So uh any volunteers to be the test subject and report on the felt result And lets have say three people with Detect Magic independently write down what it looks to them like the spell is doing if that makes sense maybe itll be obvious what it does but if not its better to have three independent components on the opinion without the opinions cross contaminating each other Thats an example of a kind of general procedure Ill be covering as basic knowledge

There are a bunch of volunteers to be the subject of Kelthams enchantment from the categories girls who think thats hot and girls who want to be helpful and girls who have never in their lives refused to volunteer for work at school and are pretty sure you go straight to Hell if you ever do There are also some non volunteers mostly from people vying to be one of the ones who writes down what they think the spell is doing 

Why are there so many of them Is that really necessary The school uniforms are not cut like that in Corentyn theyre probably not cut like that in Ostenso either bored teenage girls can get up to a lot of uniform adjustment

Its kind of awesome how everybody in Cheliax competes to be the one in front as soon as any problem comes up It may be less efficient than the dath ilani reaction of everybody carefully figuring out whos the optimal candidate or alternatively just picking at random if the consumable variation in expected utility from additional search doesnt look worth the meta overhead on a quick meta meta glance But its so much more energetic The Research Hordes enthusiasm and eagerness feels contagious

Keltham randomly picks one volunteer and three people to write down the spell effects since this is pretty obviously a case where the overhead cost exceeds the consumable knowable variance from his perspective Its not like hes really figured out how to tell these people apart yet At some point soon Keltham is going to have to explain the concept of nametags

Then the volunteer to get the spell cast will come over and do the practiced mental motion of not resisting a self affecting spell and the other three will get out notebooks to scribble down the spell structure and cast Detect Magic so they can see it

Keltham focuses and tries to cast that thing he has three copies of

Theres a feeling of magic now that thats a thing he is accustomed to feeling for and a glowing symbol appears on the girls forehead She blinks

Neato Keltham supposes Keltham waits a moment to see if the volunteer wants to volunteer any info on what the spell seems to be doing to her

Its not immediately obvious what its acting on probably stops me doing something rather than making me do something 

Its a truth spell She does not volunteer this Kelthams god gave Keltham a truth spell As a way of protesting that theyre lying to him presumably but does it mean hed take the truth well Or just that his god doesnt care for him to work with Cheliax

Are we allowed to tell him one of the three girls taking notes thinks loudly in the general direction of whoevers presumably coordinating here

There isnt an immediate answer possibly because they are debating that themselves

Keltham tries to think fast since hes not sure how long this spell will last This spell is either going to be useful for bargaining or useful for finding out something else that his god wants him to know Lets try the more innocuous one first Have you got anything on you that you own and can offer to sell me for a ludicrously huge price Try doing that

 uh sure This is my shoe and Ill sell it to you for eighteen thousand gold pieces The illusion doesnt waver I dont think it triggered

Okay doesnt prevent unfair bargains known to both parties to be unfair Try telling me that your other shoe is worth twenty thousand gold pieces What is the thing with gold around here Keltham ran across that in the books but it didnt make any sense there either

The other shoe is 

She stops

The other shoe is worth 

The other shoe is worth Twenty thousand 

Hmmm Worth twenty thousand what

She looks very frustrated Im just trying to say what you told me The other shoe is worth you told me to say the other shoe is worth twenty thousand gold pieces That works fine 

Like Zone of Truth but first circle with the visual indicator its in place How would you do that spells cant usually do disparate things like communicating whether theyre in place and also having their primary effect not at first circle Some god invested a lot of effort in that

Truth spell Try two plus two equals four then two plus two equals five

Two plus two equals four Two plus two equals two plus two might sometimes equal five somewhere

Okay out of context answer this one honestly Do you in fact believe that two plus two might sometimes equal five somewhere

Yeah somewhere there are lots of worlds and you can do a lot of weird stuff with magic and I havent encountered any proofs that there are kinds of magic that definitely dont exist or things that no kind of magic could possibly do I dont think you could do it with our kind though

One of us is very deeply confused and I wish to eternity that I was sure it was you but lets set aside that topic for later Try saying out loud that theres a ninety nine percent probability your shoe is worth twenty thousand gold then saying theres a one percent probability your shoe is worth twenty thousand gold

Keltham has been trying to think quickly about lie detection If one tries taking all appearances at face value some of the things he believes are in conflict with each other meaning he needs to keep track of separate lines of possibility

Branch 1 Keltham actually did summon a completely unknown god to Golarion and its first circle spells can do things that were not previously possible no its not that Carissa said there was such a thing as a Zone of Truth spell

So branch 2 Truthtelling spells are known They should be incredibly useful If theyre first circle cleric spells they should be in first circle cleric books This whole planet does not look like a whole planet should if it is very easy for people on that whole planet to trust each other even if it requires paying a cleric it should still have a huge effect

Branch 21 maybe the clerics themselves are just not trustworthy

Branch 22 the spell is very easy to fool Like by using Carissas illusion spell to fake that symbol even if it doesnt go up or disappears Depending on what kind of illusion piercing utilities exist and how much those cost and whether you can counter illusion piercing by paying even larger costs

Branch 23 theyre lying to him about what the spell really does because it would be very useful to criminalmastermindCheliax if Keltham believes he has an unstoppable truth compelling spell while actually it just inclines people to slightly more honesty or even does some entirely separate thing they dont want him to know

Branch 24 the spell works perfectly and unstoppably and Keltham is wrong about what effects a truth spell should have on a society

Theres a ninety nine percent probability that my shoe is worth 

Theres a one percent probability that my shoe is worth 

Imperfect evidence is still evidence and there are possible worlds where the obvious test will yield useful results They may not be ready to defeat truthtelling spells right now

Okay lets work under the assumption its an honesty spell Does not prevent attempts at deception does not enforce objective truth you just cant say things you know to be false Um 

Keltham isnt comfortable with this

 peoples lives and money are at stake somewhere in the background he really should do it anyways

Im very sorry about even asking this but Im in very weird circumstances where I know very little about this world so are you alright with asking me one or two questions about this whole situation as it is known to you while youre still under a truth spell and theres been very little time for anybody to prepare for that Ill try to keep my questions narrow I wish I could promise that I wont update on anything if you refuse but realistically I cant actually promise that

Yes of course she says immediately 

The people presumably monitoring this situation had better not need that much time to prepare a Dispel Magic and an illusion she thinks and if they have fucked that up then clearly being on the Material Plane just isnt for them

That was a weirdly fast response for somebody asked if she and her government are okay with her being interrogated under truth detection and strongly suggests that Unnamed Female Chelian 7 had thought through her answer to that question before Keltham asked it Did they know what spells he had already with the apparent experiment a sham Wouldnt she be trying to conceal her speed of thought in that case with a fake delay

Keltham thinks of another obvious fillip to this test but hes not sure he can ask questions and do that part at the same time Carissa said it required concentration to use the spell hes thinking of Hell save it for last

Question one Keltham says has your collective presentation of this entire situation and world as far as you know what Ive gotten been roughly honest

 I dont think Ive told you anything except about magic Everything I told you was true and not misleading or anything That should be enough time for an illusion and a Dispel I dont know of anyone else having told you anything untrue or misleading either I am not entirely sure I understand the question as phrased but I think yes we have been honest

Elias Abarco has a problem The problem is that Keltham is presumably thinking hell use Detect Magic to check whether his enchantments still in place and that will totally work itll show an illusion not an enchantment and if Keltham can read it games up and even if he cant he can learn how in the future they cant teach him illusion and enchantment swapped forever he can put the girl under another enchantment easily enough but the illusionll still be there what he needs is Greater Magic Aura which can put the girl under the exact right apparent magical signature but he didnt prep that and doesnt have time now 

Theres got to be a scroll of it somewhere 

Elias Abarco vanishes This is noticeable to about half the assembled persons but they all have good poker faces

Well the symbols still there Though it could be an illusion now Though some of that response seemed suspiciously specific and she wouldnt need to do that if they were spoofing the spell by any number of magical means but then she could be giving suspiciously narrow answers just to make him believe that alternatively in worlds where shes being honest maybe itd help if Keltham showed her that he is going to be reasonable in what kind of answers he expects

To the best of your knowledge and your best guesses where you do not know is the Chelian government concealing any major facts from me not relating to its internal security measures and standardly classified secrets or secrets meant to ensure my own safety or the safety of other people of Golarion from me or knowledge that is intrinsically harmful or intrinsically vastly dangerous

I dont think so I am pretty sure the Chelish government is not concealing any things from you that I am allowed to know I think the things I am not allowed to know are all in the categories you mentioned security measures secrets meant to ensure peoples safety knowledge thats harmful or dangerous probably there are some government secrets that are just embarrassing rather than properly critical to national security I dont know of any just thats what I would expect and Id expect it to also be true of all other countries

Why do the Chelish allow their version of Governance to keep secrets just because theyre embarrassing no he shouldnt ask that right now

Darn it he shouldve asked her if the government was keeping any secrets first without the qualifiers To see if she wouldve danced around that one or maybe implausibly answered No and then Keltham wouldve had a high probability on the test results being faked in that branch of reality 

Keltham really wishes hed LARPed this at least once before trying to do it in real life

To your best knowledge and best guess if somebody purportedly representing Cheliax signs an agreement with me about credit for information given future equity shares in industrialization projects or similar matters whats the probability Cheliax goes back on their word as represented by the person purported to me to represent the Chelish government Excluding scenarios where I would obviously agree in retrospect that the agreement should be broken as a matter of drastic urgency because otherwise Rovagug gets loose or whatever

Uh very low I think I cant give you a number without having a specific person in mind If a person cheats you on a contract you can take that to the courts and theyd side with you under the circumstances described I cannot really imagine a situation where someone tries to do that and the contract is on your side but the courts decide to let them thats basically just abandoning being a Lawful country Asmodeus is the god of contracts He wouldnt approve of that 

Keltham tries to think quickly about what he should be asking about here They dont actually know how to be Lawful this much is obvious at a glance So in their distorted conception Am I liable to need to negotiate incredibly carefully because somebodys gonna eat my abdominal fat if I forget to insert a clause saying they cant do that

 A Baseline idiom roughly equivalent to skin me in a deal

I think its recommended to read contracts really carefully and if you can afford it with intelligence enhancement up I uh even if you fail to word something carefully obviously theres also the thing where if you feel like were being bad trade partners you can deal with someone else in future But I would definitely not avoid spelling something out on the assumption that we think the same things are being reasonable

Sorry for demanding that you spell it out but on your best knowledge and best guess how much does the Chelian version of Governance reliably care about not looking like theyre bad trade partners when dealing with somebody like me Are they liable to I dunno yoink all the gains from trade with a clever contract term and then classify the whole thing a secret so that nobody knows about it That kind of thing being allowed to governments is still weirding Keltham out hes only been here a day and thats not nearly enough time to get used to the idea of governments behaving like the governments around here

Its the Chelish government but she wouldnt dream of correcting him about this I dont think theyre likely to do that If they did youd probably leave right and do this work somewhere else and they really want you to do it here If there was some way they could uh invalidating your will when you died of old age because it had a loophole and requisition your money then maybe theyd do that Because all thatd change if people knew about it is that theyd try to write their wills without loopholes Im not a contract lawyer though and you probably want one

Keltham is trying to think quickly because he doesnt know how long the spell lasts and what else should he ask he doesnt know 

Well theres always going meta

Say what you think is the question that I would most from my own perspective want you to answer under truth spell with your statement including your stated belief that its what Id most want to ask

This is like a nightmare about final exams I think Id expect youd most want to ask what the Queen is like Or who you can trust the most of the people here Or uh whether you can get other truth spells cast for you so you dont have to think of it right now

Oh right that does remind him Whats the Queen like And how would you defeat a truth spell and how would you defeat the defeaters of a truth spell and where does that chain end up

 I dont actually know much about her She took power young she was only sixteen Its said Asmodeus invested in her development as a person when she was even younger than that because she had potential I think shes a sorcerer but thats not unusual Uh a normal truth spell like Zone of Truth you can beat with a will save but I think thatd be visible in this case because the symbol would vanish you could beat this one with an illusion of that symbol I guess you could beat that with something for seeing through illusions I think among sufficiently powerful wizards theyd just have demiplanes in which the laws of magic are very limited and they can be sure of what theyre seeing and among everyone else you can only be mostly sure not completely sure that someone didnt think of something you didnt think of a counter to

What cleric spells up to fifth circle do you know of that can be used to see through illusions and what would it take to defeat those cleric spells

Shit 

She cant really pretend she doesnt know what Detect Magic is But stall right thats the thing to do buy time Probably theres a book here somewhere with all the cleric spells can someone grab it while theres still time left on the spell uh I know theres True Seeing which shows you the world exactly as it is without any illusions and with transmutations shown for what they really are and thats sixth for wizards but its fifth for clerics There are also items of it you could ask for one though theyre incredibly expensive Theres Detect Magic will at least tell you that theres an illusion spell present except I havent seen this particular truth spell before so I dont know if it shows up as illusion magic already Ha Itd be unusual for it to be a cross school spell like that but its an unusual spell anyway Theres I dont know the cleric spell list all that well Im sorry 

Someone shoves a book in her face with the relevant page open Oh you could use Dispel Magic to dispel Silent Image and then if that does anything you know someone was using Silent Image You could use Greater Detect Magic to see all spells cast in the area recently that wouldnt work here because weve all been spellcasting all day but you could do this again tomorrow somewhere which looks clean to start

Tell me that you havent left out any obvious other tactics I could use

I havent left out any obvious other tactics you could use

He was planning to do this part anyway but having her mention Detect Magic puts him on a timeline if theres any defeaters they could use against Detect Magic that they didnt already start planning for before he showed up in the library today Wait twenty Taldane doesnt have a word for the dath ilani time unit he wants of course Wait around ten times as long as this interval Open close Then say that everything youve said so far was the truth Oh and then everybody else whos got Detect Magic please cast that slowly and one at a time that so I can watch you catching the cantrip Im still trying to figure out cantrip catching

And Keltham casts Greater Detect Magic

The girl under the Truth Spell is pale and distracted Counting in her head to twenty 

Greater Detect Magic translates the vague sense of magic one can get from concentrating on trying to feel it into something visual Its stunning Humans are wildly better at interpreting information in this format The room appears to be draped in glittering spiderwebs with half familiar structures Some of the spiderwebs are lively tangible looking almost strong enough to hold someone some of them are made of dust gradually drifting away but still retaining its rough structure Some of them glow much brighter than others The area at the door is glowing a lot 

There is one enchantment on the girl Its pattern is recognizable its the one he cast

Everything Ive said so far was the truth she says shakily when she has counted to twenty 

Elias Abarco tucks a used scroll neatly away in the pocket dimension hes wearing as a belt and surveys the girls to see who was impressed enough by his ability to find a scroll of Greater Magic Aura in a magic shop in Absalom in under three minutes including both teleports getting back with a minute to spare that they might fuck him while Kelthams delaying for sperm negotiation reasons 

Keltham tries to memorize what he can about the spell structure on the girl to be checked later against what happens when he casts it on himself or when he has more ideas about magic

Then Keltham turns to look at the other Research Hordettes so he can watch cantrip casting Hell think later about what this all adds up to right now he needs to maintain concentration on the spell before he tries for example to experiment with talking at the same time

The girls all have Detect Magic and are happy to demonstrate cantrip catching They can do it while talking while standing on one foot two of them demonstrate that they can do it while kissing each other 

Under any other circumstances Keltham would let himself notice more his reactions to this or wonder about the local prevalence of bisexuality because they wouldnt have sent him strictly homosexual women he doesnt think but right now hes trying to watch how cantrips work and not lose concentration on his spell Hes thought of one other test he can try here lets see if he can talk and maintain Greater Detect Magic at the same time

When hes watched the way to catch the cantrip however many times Keltham turns back to the truth spell subject and says Try saying out loud This sentence is false Did he manage to maintain concentration during that

Hes still holding on to his magic detection

The girl nods

Wait what should a truth spell stop her saying that or not shes going to guess yes Its a good thing they did some attempts earlier so she knows what the spell feels like when it stops you This sentence is 

Repeat This sentence is true

This sentence is true Maybe that one shouldnt have worked either but her first guess was that it would and she doesnt exactly have time for two

Its not much of a test because it almost surely goes by whatever the girl believed the answer was supposed to be but if Keltham later gets to try this spell on himself and it allows him to say This sentence is false that will be an iota of evidence anyways Or if he tries that query pattern on subjects outside of Cheliax and never gets that pattern of answers again

He still has concentration on Greater Detect Magic apparently though he was working hard on that Yay him

Can he think of anything else he should try while the truth spell is running and they havent had as much time to prepare against it as they will later Keltham is having trouble thinking of anything 

Ive been having trouble contacting whichever god clericed me What could be preventing my god from talking to me

Uh your god might be too alien to humans to successfully communicate with us They might think youre on the right track and dont need additional guidance They might have an agreement of some kind with other gods about limiting intervention They might be trying but your mind is too weird or your soul is far away because you started in a different universe or something I dont know that this really needs explanation because gods talk to one maybe two people in the whole world in a year 

Were any books conspicuously missing from this library Any book or class of books youd expect to have seen in a library like this one but they werent here

I dont think so The Archduke doesnt have much of a wizardry collection but the likeliest explanation is that hes not a wizard which is also publicly claimed about him so I wasnt very surprised The library at school is bigger but thats probably because it has several copies of books and more wizardry books

Keltham has already been feeling guilty about the level of stress he might be putting this girl under Unless shes the local equivalent of a Keeper trainee as part of a massive government confusion operation But if shes not then hes not unaware of how this might be stressful for her

Ironically enough its the question of How mean have I been to her exactly and how much of a favor do I owe her now that suggests his last query Maybe she doesnt think he owes her a favor at all On a scale from way too little to way too much would you say that Im currently being more suspicious than is appropriate for Golarion in general and Cheliax in particular or not suspicious enough

 uh I 

 its a little like you are charging off in a direction no one has ever travelled before and asking whether youre going unusually fast or unusually slow People go faster on roads because there are roads I dont know if that 

 uh I think if you are trying to make a lot of money and not get cheated you are probably being more suspicious than is appropriate and if you were trying to uh assassinate the Queen and overthrow the government and become ruler of southern Avistan then you are not being suspicious enough for that

Thats all I can think of for now then Ill leave the spell up in case I think of anything in another minute but for now you dont need to say anything Im sorry about all the fuss and in the event that my interrogation there represented an undue imposition of stress relative to the amount you have been paid or are being paid for this I consider myself to owe you a favor in repayment for it

She nods Doesnt say anything because he said she didnt need to

I expect the spell has less than a minute left Carissa says You must be fourth circle not third or itd have run out already Or would if it were still in effect instead of it being a spell of Abarcos that hes going to dismiss at the right time But Keltham didnt know they knew he was fourth circle so it running out at the right time should be mildly persuasive to Keltham if Keltham knows enough to know how spell durations are linked to spell circles she has a headache and she hasnt even been doing anything That poor girl Perhaps they should have something like this in standard classes at that age teach the kids to handle themselves under pressure

Great Keltham didnt realize he was giving that away based on duration shouldve realized some spells he was reading had similar timing by caster circle but too late Over soon enough then

This next part is embarrassing But if anybody catches you covering up an embarrassing mistake thats much more undignified And if you do it by violating something you were deontologically obligated to do that is a lot more serious So it doesnt particularly occur to Keltham not to do what he does next He owes somebody a favor and so he must 

Also and Im sorry about this your names all sound unhelpfully similar in my native language theres two of them per person and you dont wear convenient labels stating them so can somebody else say whats her name again So I know who it is I owe a favor

Thats Tonia Barrero someone else says Should we uh wear labels with our names on them we can 

Tonia Barrero Tonia Barrero Tonia Barrero

Yes please actually Itll speed up my ability to uh recognize you individually So long as were throwing around truth spells and clearing the air you all from my perspective have a lot of collisions inside the same corner of the appearance volume I expect if there were dath ilani here a lot of them would look to you like they were the same person as me because the facial recognition area of your brain wouldnt be trained to distinguish over the variances there And on that embarrassing note I think my next step is to sign a preliminary agreement on disclosure of basic info before I can come back here and disclose some basic info to yall

The girls seem mostly nonfazed by this and carefully tear paper out of their notebooks to pin to their uniform lapels 

Tian people all look the same to Avistani people Meritxell Narbona says But if you say that to them theyll say what hes obviously from a completely different country 

Tonia Barrero sits down in a way that is only a little bit like collapsing to the ground 

Carissa is pretty sure that the team of people who finagled that Truth Spell sequence are decompressing right now and unlikely to be giving her advice which is inconvenient because this seems like a situation where some advice would come in handy

That looked like Abadars symbol She has seen it at the Worldwound His clerics use it as a spellcasting focus

Abadar is Lawful Neutral Which fits Keltham thinks hes Chaotic Evil but hes really not very evil except by comparison to his society which sounds unbearably Good and hes really not Chaotic except by comparison with with Lawful outsiders that dont have free will 

Abadar and Asmodeus get along They have similar goals insofar as humans can understand god goals They want civilization they want cities they want agreements and they want those agreements enforced This should be good news except if Abadar was reasonably pleased with how things were proceeding he would not have dropped four cleric circles on Keltham Thats a thing you do if you might want to fight your way out Maybe Abadars offended that theyre lying to Keltham In which case wow they just dug that hole really really deep theres no credible way to not lie to Keltham at this point her fault shes the one who initially decided to elide everything that usually makes foreigners look pityingly at you and shes not sure she can explain that decision and presumably everyone important didnt just go oh well follow Carissas lead but maybe she constrained their options 

 shes scared 

 well Not saying anything about the symbol is not the thing a cooperative Carissa would do in this situation but its not incontrovertible evidence of hiding something Abadar has lots of symbols and its not like shes been to one of His churches though also she wont be able to explain why she obviously hasnt been to one of his churches she has a feeling Keltham will disapprove of gods that ban the worship of other gods on the same sort of utterly bizarre grounds that he disapproves of shes tempted to gloss it as people in authority acting in their self interest but is entirely sure hed object to that characterization 

We should look up the symbol she says as a middle ground I could swear Ive seen it somewhere before

Keltham looks away from Tonia Barrero hell think later about likelihood ratios for whether thats an appropriate amount of stress for somebody to display while under truthspell by an alien youre not planning to betray that also wouldve been a nice thing to decide in advance instead of in hindsight but oh well to Carissa Yeah lets get somebody on that I guess Also Carissa if youre the right person to ask this how do we go set in motion the thing where I meet a proper government authority and sign a baseline contract governing credit for the disclosure of ideas too basic to be proprietary No point in wasting time about that part and until its done all I can do is read books or I guess maybe try studying wizard magic earlier in the day rather than later

Ill check on that she says I suspect theyre here and just waiting for you to want them And she turns around and walks out like she knows where shes going because presumably security will intercept her soon enough

They do 

He wants to sign a 

We heard

Do you know what god that might be Obviously they do but even here where he cant plausibly hear them its smarter to say it this way

Were looking into it 

So no decision yet on what to tell him Do you need my help

I dont think so Why dont you walk Contessa Lrilatha in

Fuck fuck fuck fuck thats the devil provided personally by Asmodeus to the Queen as an advisor why is Carissa here she is so much likelier to die horribly than she was three days ago and she did not evaluate her escape options at all she was thinking about how to make it work rather than whether there was still an opening to stay clear of it and now there isnt Id be delighted she says immediately

While waiting for Carissa to come back Keltham tries to dismiss his own truth spell if thats a thing he can do He tries not to give any outward sign maybe if they cast an illusion but the real truth compulsion is a kind of spell he can dispel at will the hypothetical illusion casters wont know to remove their illusion

The spell does not seem to vanish

Another datapoint to check later

 what did he think of that whole affair Is it likely that they had an illusion spell plus whatever it takes to defeat Greater Detect Magic ready and prepped by some wizard hiding behind the library walls or out of phase with the material world Just in case the alien suddenly turned into at least a second circle cleric who had both a truth spell and Greater Detect Magic which is apparently itself not a thing that happens very often

Definitely Governance in dath ilan is competent enough to have prepared for everything they can possibly prepare for if for some reason they need to do something of the sort But Golarion does not have their shit together the way that dath ilan does and if intelligence around here caps out at Kelthams level would Keltham have managed to prepare against every contingency like that Maybe And intelligence headbands are a thing too supposedly

Like a lot of other things its hard for him to guess but at least its evidence

He does have a certain intuitive sense that somebody actually under a truth spell should have stumbled over herself a little more than Tonia did occasionally getting blocked on bad phrasings or whatever After he started asking real questions she didnt sound quite the same as when he was asking the test questions But that is also something he can check by truthspelling himself later And the trouble is if you go looking for enough tiny signs like that you will eventually find some whether they exist or not

Contessa Llilratha is a stunningly beautiful woman with sharp cheekbones and a twelve foot wingspan The wings are feathered and black Even without them shed look a little inhuman She says nothing to Carissa which in Carissas opinion is the best thing that has happened to her all day and proceeds to the library to meet Keltham Even folded the wings make it impossible to walk abreast with her in these hallways Carissa walks behind

They enter the library 

You said you wished to negotiate a contract with the Executive collective of Cheliax regarding formal and informal rights of information and its dissemination I am Contessa Lliratha advisor from Hell to the Chief Executive of Cheliax and my signature is binding upon the Executive collective of Cheliax Contessa Lliratha says in Baseline

Carissa casts an extremely discreet Tongues of her own so she can follow whats going on

Okay whoa they do not go out of their way to avoid sexual superstimuli around here because that is the hottest humanoid Keltham has seen ever Shes dressed in what he guesses to be the local equivalent of body armor and makes it look better than would be legal in most cities outside of a Shop of Ill Advised Consumer Goods Theres something about her that makes the armor look more dangerous than dath ilani actresses in movies have ever managed to do with their own body armor as seen by him across a screen Keltham has never realized before that he would like to add that to his list of positive mate qualities

Keltham is not even remotely considering hitting on her shes busy and Keltham hasnt proven himself anywhere near that far and knows it She might also not be of a species that can mate with his come to think

Keltham tilts his head in a brief but formal dath ilani gesture of acknowledgment such as would be appropriate for a medium size business owner greeting a Legislator Markers in Baseline say that Contessa is her title not her name but he has no idea what that title means it didnt translate Ill endeavor to waste your time as little as possible and apologize in advance for those inevitable wastes of time that will occur anyways due to my profound ignorance of this world and uncalibration over how cautious I need to be I observe that your physiology is outside of what I know as the human range of observed variation if your cognitive psychology is correspondingly outside the human range of observed variation is there anything I should know about that to make this conversation proceed quickly and effectively

Being able to speak Baseline again is a relief he can say what he actually means and not have that come out in enormous long sentences full of enormous words

I am a devil unlike humans devils are uniformly Lawful Evil and do not tend to possess internal contradicting impulses Devils possess a correspondingly better understanding of Law but it is reported your society has gone unprecedentedly far in inculcating that in mortals anyway Do you prefer these negotiations happen unobserved or that witnesses commit to not sharing their contents

Keltham restrains himself from asking how Golarion manages to be this messed up if there is anyone sane around shes a busy woman I would wish the outputs of the negotiation to be witnessed in their translation If these negotiations are to be carried out in Baseline it makes no obvious difference to me whether incomprehensible words are witnessed or not You may optimize this for your own convenience or for the benefit of or protection of those who would otherwise witness it

Your security has translation magic readily available to them and by default would observe you

I again have no objection Keltham isnt even sure why she feels the need to clarify this point well theres one possible hypothesis I do not intend to conduct myself in any fashion I would not wish known widely and written in history

She smiles very slightly My understanding is that you possess information on among other things teaching mortals Lawfulness and that you wish to negotiate terms under which it will be disseminated within Golarion subject to whatever restrictions are necessary to protect peoples safety here

Keltham starts dumping his local utility function step one of expeditious negotiations It seems to me in my ignorance that this world is faced with a problem the Worldwound which requires of it a superior level of collective competence on pain of its possible destruction I have information that will perhaps be helpful for this should I succeed in conveying such I wish to capture for myself some small but fair fraction of those gains I may then sell some of my information of that type which would soon be profitable to its possessor and perhaps sell it excludably to that possessor alone for as long as it takes to be rediscovered elsewhere

But of the types of information I have in my possession it seems to me that there is much information which would and should end up disseminated beyond Cheliax even in the short term having the character of truly basic knowledge that is the foundation of too much else and too much further research as may need to happen in other places for the Worldwound to be expeditiously defeated Nor is it likely in the long run that this world shall converge to an equilibrium in which Cheliax alone knows the more advanced equivalents of basic math Nor is it particularly appealing to me that many people of Golarion in the long run should end up ignorant even if I gained twice as much money thereby if I am at all useful and I capture the smallest fraction of the resulting gains I expect to saturate my uses for money and so the remainder of my utility is in my concern for the aesthetics of my deeds Even if Asmodeus deemed it in his interests that Chelish alone know the ways of Law aspiring thought a hundred and forty four years hence it is not yet obvious to me that this is my own interest in the affair Then much of the information I have forming the foundation of that which I wish to sell is that which should be disseminated and though it not be sold exclusively I would yet wish the credit to myself and to my world which taught me for the sharing of that knowledge and the benefits it brings Such gratuities as might be legally due to it would be due to myself with middlemans fees to Cheliax only for that part which Cheliax actually played and such informal gratitude as might be due would be known to be credited to Keltham of dath ilan and to Cheliax accurately for whichever role it actually played in conveying that information further

And yet it has been observed to me by Carissa Sevar that I am ignorant of this world and may not understand the consequences of sharing such information Nor have I the experience to negotiate a lasting contract with confidence As a hedge against both this folly of mine and the imperfect overlap of our interests I had thought to suggest a baseline contract establishing a point of departure and next best alternative to renegotiated agreement under which information I share freely with Cheliax must be made available to those factions which presently contribute to the fight at the Worldwound after a period of one month known to have come from Keltham of dath ilan with the help of Cheliax unless that contract is renegotiated before then with exceptions for such information as may be designated infohazardous by a majority vote of whichever Worldwound fighting deities known to be able to speak on the subject may make their opnions known on that subject And then if that turns out to be stupid and you can make me see its stupid it could be renegotiated before the month was up This would not be the only contract that needed signing but it would let me get started on teaching the basic structure of reality and the way of Law aspiring thought while I gained the knowledge and confidence to sign other contracts

I suspect the aesthetically satisfying way of doing this in your world would not be aesthetically satisfying in ours either in implementation or in results 

Cheliax lets people in If they hear we are doing something better than what everyone else is doing and they come here or go to a church of Asmodeus somewhere else and they say they want to come here or want to learn these things we would not hesitate to teach them

There are a dozen things that I can think of offhand that could go wrong with telling those nations at the Worldwound whatever your procedures are but to name two representative ones there are organizations at the Worldwound that do not make and will not keep commitments There are also organizations that will try but not be very good at it There isnt a meaningful difference between the organizations at the Worldwound get it and everyone getting it except in who is getting a head start 

Taldor mostly sends criminals to the Worldwound to be rid of them and I think some people there are there for taking part in an effort to overthrow the government of Taldor and it seems likely that if they were more capable and possessed with a valuable resource they could trade onward there would be a war

Aside from that its a fine set of people to get a head start if we want to give it to everyone at all which I am uncertain of The society you describe is different from ours in many ways and it seems possible that the ideas you are describing do not work as the foundation for a society of humans without some other behind the scenes implementation screening or emergency response we dont have

Asmodeus thinks Cheliax should chance it But if Cheliax chances it and then its a terrible idea Chelish provinces will break off to be independent or Chelish people will leave for somewhere else If you do this everywhere there wont be a somewhere else

 This is exactly how Keltham expects a Very Serious Person to talk It stands in extremely sharp contrast to the gibberish written in the library books Its making Keltham wonder whether this is sheer convergent evolution of agents who think more sanely or if somebody is precogging him or reading his mind or if something smarter than human looked at transcripts of everything hes said and deduced what sort of arguments he would respond to

Also why must everything in Golarion be such a mess why why why

Okay Do they have obvious incentives Yes They have obvious incentives coming out of their ass They probably do not think Keltham is not supposed to notice this Lrilatha has met smart people ever and possibly met Asmodeus

Is Keltham going to ignore reasonable depictions of potential catastrophe because they could be incentivized lies Realistically no That would be wantonly stupid in possible worlds that are way too large to act wantonly stupid inside them

Suppose I put to you as an alternative suggestion that Lawful factions at the Worldwound receive such information and may of course restrict its use while testing is underway in Cheliax should they themselves deem that wise

Is this the kind of information that could plausibly leak through carelessness or forgetfulness of the exact terms under which it was shared or intoxicated pillow talk or would it be impossible to share unwisely with someone who plausibly should not be an early recipient without soberly and deliberately deciding it was a good idea to teach them

I do not understand your people and their prior knowledge base well enough to guess what is memetically contagious over a significant fraction of the population I would not have thought the basic concepts difficult and yet the process by which they were imbued in me does in retrospect involve training from earliest childhood That training being absent here the inspiration of Law is also absent to a degree that baffled and shocked me Perhaps Law is not so contagious even if what I try to teach for redistribution is only the most basic elements of Law aspiring thinking for human beings and the most simple features of reality It is hard for me to see the pathway by which people becoming saner would leave them worse off as you may or may not already know the Law itself proclaims that should not happen among agents already Law abiding but Golarion is still very baffling to me I had not thought to share dangerous information I was not in my own society one of those who held dangerous information in their keeping But if what is not dangerous to us is dangerous to you I dont know I havent considered good concrete examples Do you have one in mind

The information in combination with a particular set of values persuades most people to immediately commit suicide and mortals get aggressively selected for inability to understand Law it seems possible to me that this has already happened or something adjacent is an operative constraint on our mortal population in some form The information in combination with a particular set of values persuades some people that the universe ought to be destroyed and they should aid Rovagug in escaping or otherwise try to bring about its destruction people do decide that and try that sometimes and obviously always fail but until a century ago the gods had Foresight and so there was not even the chance they would succeed Now the gods dont have Foresight and it is required that the cultists not be competent

Sighgreat In my world there are those who hold all such secrets in their Keeping and even I would show them deference for the many oaths theyve sworn I dont suppose theres any analogous such institution here to send one of their own who has already sworn neutrality in all conflicts between factions and corporations

I think a world has to build many other strengths first before a mortal could take those oaths and be expected to mean them and have a reliability at keeping them that approached what would be required Devils would call on an axiomite but I know of none of those on this plane and it seems plausible they could not survive in it They are found in Lawful Outer Planes

Axis Theyre found in Axis Perhaps even Contessa Lrilatha is unsure whether to make it clear to Keltham that everything about Keltham is found in Axis

Someday shes going to die and if she is EXTREMELY brilliant and EXTREMELY perfect then someday after that she will get to be like that and itll be worth all the agony in between

The lower Keepers have broken their oaths in recorded memory but not the highest Keepers in my world But if they dont exist here then thats the fact Are there leaders of Law aspiring factions in enough direct contact with Law abiding gods that they at least could be entrusted with potentially dangerous information Hes suspicious of the notion that he managed to drop in on the only faction that could safely handle incredibly valuable information but not infinitely so whatever force dropped him here could have made a choice of destinations

The pharaoh of Osirion is in very close contact with Abadar and very likely to be truthworthy with this And they think He knows of it already The leadership of Nidal is likewise in close contact with their Lawful god but their Lawful god is Zon Kuthon the one who had his values inverted by the void I recommend handling Nidal and Zon Kuthons church differently than youd handle all the other churches and factions The imperial line of Minkai claims descent from Shizuru Lawful Good goddess of the sun and I expect though less confidently they could be trusted as well 

Shizuru stopped taking actions in the Material Plane several thousand years ago Minkai is isolationist and eight thousand miles away

From my own perspective I desire to prepare against the contigency that Cheliax finds it of utility to monopolize knowledge that I have no utility in Cheliax monopolizing Suppose then a contract which if not renegotiated by mutual consent within a year at the end of that year sends a copy of all recorded underlying knowledge I divulge to the leader of Minkai and the leader of Osirion Cheliax may not without my own consent broadcast that knowledge in any form which fails to credit it to Keltham brought of dath ilan Should it begin to spread in any case this putative contract requires you to inform me of this fact as it becomes apparent and to give appropriate credit then unless otherwise renegotiated And though this was also said informally before I came here Cheliax nor Asmodeus nor their agents may not hinder me from departing at any time should I choose to do so nor from earning such money as may be required to pay my passage nor from trading for such passage at its customary fee nor by any magic or other means take my knowledge from me or prevent me from retelling it With the intent being that I am not hindered from spreading the information myself should it seem wise and should Cheliax refuse to do so

What would you propose that Cheliax do should we learn that you intend to imperil our world

 fair if he tries to take their perspective on the alien Shizuru Abadar and Asmodeus or their representatives may by their unanimous agreement annul this contract Or nothing in the contract shall be construed to prevent me from being stopped or imprisoned as authorized by majority vote of the Lawful deities of Golarion which is probably a weird way to put it but Im not sure what the usual way is of stopping people out to free Rovagug Id hope thered be some sort of interfactional treaty on that which if so no agreement merely between Keltham and Cheliax could or should hinder 

It is a concession on top of what was communicated by Asmodeus which was just that they had to let him go eventually and not torture him or cause him comparably incapacitating kinds of harm She probably has to make it though If they cant hurt him they need him cooperative and he is smart enough to notice if she has a brilliant justification for not giving him even the most reasonable of the things that he wants and to treat that as information of which he already has rather too much

Cheliax Asmodeus and our agents may not hinder you from departing at any time should you choose to do so nor from earning such money as may be required to pay your passage nor from trading for such passage at its customary fee nor by any magic or other means take your knowledge from you or prevent you from retelling it except insofar as this would contradict normal procedures for protecting the world from destruction which do exist The other terms are in broad strokes acceptable to us Shall we work out the details

Yes lets I apologize for the expense of your time but I need to know a little about what is covered by normal procedures for protecting the world from destruction which for all I know authorizes say you personally to imprison any person in Cheliax at any time for any reason

On an alert from Asmodeus or a god allied with him that a person poses an immediate threat to Golarions continued existence or habitability for humans we stop them You have my word we would not kill you or take actions against you beyond containing you even under those circumstances but we might not release you until we had appropriately addressed the avenue by which you threatened the world

Is Asmodeus a kind of entity that simply does not issue such orders falsely or by playing with the definitions of terms Anything is a threat to the world on a line of sufficiently low probability

If you meant any of the things you said about the Worldwound the expected lifespan of the world should be longer given your presence in it if that were true then arresting you would obviously not qualify as protecting the world from destruction If you want to oblige Asmodeus to get additional gods to agree with Him we can write that in gods dont differ on predictions theyve had time to think about

It wouldnt have occurred to Keltham to imagine that Lawful gods could have common knowledge of disagreement before theyd had time to think no she must just be talking about convergence of gods first order opinions or their empirically observed convergence times under conditions where they cant share info

I think Im happy with you having the right to stop and contain me but not otherwise kill me or take actions against me upon Asmodeus alerting that he swears the world is predicted to have a net lower probability of surviving the next century if you dont thus stop me for reasons irrespective of Asmodeus or his agents having deliberately decided to promote lower survival probabilities in that conditional As near as Keltham can figure that should only break if Asmodeus swears falsely in which case this whole treaty is empty paper Im also happy to hear about more standard agreements and treaties protecting the world into which you believe this treaty should interface

Thats satisfactory to us Theres an extension of the Worldwound treaty with fewer signatories committing that in the event of an imminent threat to the world of greater magnitude than the Worldwound signatories will extend the Worldwound treatys provisions for coordination to that automatically and cease hostilities against each other you might want to look it up but I dont think this would need to interface with that There are other agreements Ill make you aware of if you seem to be on a path to discovering the vulnerability they guard against

Please do I am not as I understand it Good but I do have business ethics that forbid destroying other peoples private property or the entire planet they live on Are there other provisions to be negotiated or should we start writing up

Im prepared to start writing up an agreement along the lines we have just outlined 

I expect your speed to exceed mine and am happy to have you do so May I have your assurance that you will not write with intent to include terms phrasings or conditions which would be interpreted by any relevant entities in ways that would surprise me or have consequences favorable to yourself and unfavorable to myself which you mostly expect me not to notice

There are six people on the planet with the Sense Motive skill to notice that this devil feels this is the most egregiously joyless contract condition ever devised clearly devised by people with no sense of honorable competition

That is very reasonable Of course You have my assurance that I will not write with intent for any of the contracts conditions or terms to be interpreted in a way that would surprise you or in a way counter to the agreement that we just devised or with detrimental consequences to you that I expect you not to notice 

All right lets go

She plucks a feather off her wing sharpens it with her teeth and starts writing She writes very quickly apparently just limited by the necessity of pausing every line to blow on the ink so it dries She has very beautiful handwriting 

Keltham comes from a world whose fantasy novels developed in such fashion as to not include any tropes under which writing a contract with a devils ichor would have supernatural effects Contracts are shadows of the one irreplaceable Algorithm and breaking them might get powerful supernatural beings angry at you for peeing on the Algorithm but this would be totally unrelated to the ink in which those contracts were written History has been screened off and the best guess shared false historical world fiction that developed afterwards doesnt include the best guess that people used to use feathers as pens thats not a trope either

Keltham is staring at this trying to figure out whether she is an artificial organism designed in such fashion that her anatomy just happens to include better pens than could otherwise be supplied on short notice to a Government negotiation in a secure facility

She regrets the necessity of not answering this question for him because shes not acknowledged to be reading his mind 

The contract is three pages when shes finished it She hands it to him 

Keltham reads it over in a relative hurry mindful of the expensive time of the Very Serious Alien sitting across from him He still takes time to carefully scrutinize three important looking sections and randomly samples two innocent looking sections for scrutiny Its not written like a dath ilani contract would be but that hardly surprises him the point of a contract is to be written in a standard language for the locale in which it will be interpreted to have predictable effects on the arbiters who will interpret it Dath ilani contract language would not be predictable in this region

It basically seems to be what they discussed

Sorry but just to check Was this document indeed completely authored by you just now and was it thereby covered by the assurance I heard regarding an absence of detrimental terms you expect to surprise me Keltham says He did notice having had a few moments to think about it that if Somebody else stepped in and wrote through her the given assurance wouldnt hold

I wrote every word on those three pages and the assurances I gave you are intended to hold for everything in the contract

 which could always be an auditory illusion but then she could also just not be a Lawful being in the first place if theyre lying about that At some point you have to notice that these eight million doomy possibilities are all highly conditionally dependent on each other meaning that the world in which theyre all false has a decent enough probability

Keltham signs

She signs as well

She sets the quill under its own power to producing a copy it does this even faster than she wrote the first version I will look forward to working with you in the future she says while it writes

This happens to not be a standard dath ilani business pleasantry prompting Keltham to start analyzing the statement for possible hidden meanings that shed want to communicate to him the obvious baseline interpretation that itd be of positive expected utility to have future interactions theyd both deemed to be of positive expected utility wouldnt seem to communicate much extra information

Shes not also flirting with him is she

If so Kelthams kinda got enough to worry about in that department already Maybe someday when hes got a lot more sexual self confidence

I hope and expect there will be future business opportunities worth your time Keltham replies with ambiguity leaning negative

She takes the second copy and walks out everyone in her path steps well clear of it

Now there goes a female entity who actually acts like a sane person Keltham says in Taldane You know I frankly dont understand how your planet manages to be so screwed up if people like her are even around Do you just have a custom of not asking them what youre doing wrong or what

No one is quite sure how to answer that question and it shows for a moment 

Well itd be stunningly presumptuous to talk to her which I guess is a way of saying yes What would you expect I dont know the Worldwound to look like if people listened to her about things

Didnt get the chance to observe it in detail remember But in broad strokes it sounds like the Worldwound military expedition is one of the most functional parts of your entire planet presumably because its backed by relatively more attention from highly intelligent gods Id expect the rest of the planet to have better coordination and more advanced material you know this is just going directly into the lecture on the basics that I can now start giving Anyone want to take a minute to get set up before I start covering like the basics of Lawfulness so someday you can be as awesome as her Oh and I shouldve thought to have said this earlier but I cant cast illusion spells yet so I need Taldane has no word for whiteboard or multipen Lovely an erasable vertical surface to draw on and if available thick erasable pens in multiple colors

Someday be as awesome as Contessa Lliratha is a very compelling pitch Hell does not in the typical case produce results that good and everyone gathers excitedly around Vertical surfaces are by default eraseable if you have Prestidigitation and pens in multiple colors can be found with slightly more scrambling than that

Keltham takes their scrambling time as a pause in which to think Its been a long time at least by the standards of his total life lived so far since the very basics were explained to him Keltham was stupider then hopefully stupider than these people are now because he sure doesnt want to spend years painstakingly teaching all that stuff with like a dozen dozen dozen carefully composed exercises whose exact details he cant possibly remember unless theres an intelligence enhancing spell for that

Maybe hell just like rapidly state as true all the things that are true and see if that just works for most things before he tries to do anything more difficult than that In accordance with the classic dath ilani proverb heuristic which says Try things the easy way first if you succeed you wont need to try them the difficult way if you fail youll know the first part that makes it difficult instead of guessing that in advance

The proverb itself puts Keltham in mind of the Watchers of Children who first spoke the proverb to him Mostly of course children learn from older children but there are adults who know more to oversee the process and prevent any semantic drift that might otherwise occur They are not full fledged Keepers those Child Watchers but they are in a profession that calls for an oath or three Children matter a lot what happens to them is one of the causal lynchpins of everything else that makes Civilization work And the Watchers who specialize in teaching foundational subjects are those who are selected among other qualities for being able to hold very basic truths in reverence and operate them with joy

Keltham is not usually a reverent person but it has never particularly occurred to him to question the attitudes that his Watchers took towards the deeper truths of reality and thought when Keltham was a child

Keltham remembers then how things are taught to children especially those ideas too important and precise to be entrusted to the teaching of older children alone Keltham draws those feelings about himself

And Keltham holds forth upon the Way

Even when you truly expect and anticipate that something will happen to you sometimes something else happens to you instead Beliefs are the name given to those things that control your anticipations that which gives to you your actual experiences is termed reality Sufficiently young children have not yet developed the capability to appreciate that their beliefs the beliefs of other people and reality are three distinct objects of thought they are not capable of distinguishing between what they know themselves and what other people know Comprehending this marks a threshold in what is taught to dath ilani children Keltham thinks everybody here probably understands that already so hes going to skip over that threshold and the exercises leading up to it but people should let him know if this starts being a sticking point

Reality possesses both overt order and deeper order surface appearances and facts behind them Deeper order can be obvious or nonobvious When you observe that Jennith resembles her mother Merwen you observe a surface seeming when you say that daughters often resemble mothers in general you are observing a deeper order If you could peer at things that were arbitrarily small like being able to look at a bug as though it were the size of a bird and smaller yet and you saw tiny twisting spirals inside Jennith all carrying the same very long intricate pattern and you saw that half of those tiny twisting spirals appeared also in Merwen and the other half of Jenniths spirals had come from her father Eveth you would have discovered a nonobvious deeper order something with the promise of explaining the obvious deeper order Baseline has a separate word by which to speak of the nonobvious deeper order the hidden order Behind a hidden order may lie another hidden order Even when you are not told about a hidden order even when nobody knows what the hidden order is it may still exist and be the secret factor that has organized the seeming chaos of the experiences before you

The understanding that reality is full of hidden order is the threshold that marks a minds readiness to apprehend the Lawfulness of reality Once a child becomes able to distinguish between what they know and what others know and what is that child can soon after apprehend that what seems to them like madness confusion noise or simply a collection of boring unconnected facts is only the appearance of a collection of unconnected facts the absence of knowledge of an explanation if one exists these children are ready to understand that their own bewilderment is their map of the world and that the territory itself is never feeling bewildered and that it is often full of hidden orders

It is possible to believe that something is a hidden order and be wrong about that maps of hidden orders are not thereby part of the territory theyre just maps of a supposedly deeper part of the territory Children are led through several exercises meant to help them appreciate this fact on a deep level that you in your own mind are really impressed with a theory of hidden order is not the same fact as that hidden order actually being present in the territory and able to control your experiences This has always seemed like a really obvious point to Keltham now that his brain is mature so hes just going to press on without doing a lot of exercises there but people should speak up if thats somehow torpedoing the rest of his lecture

It was the way of reality in the universe that Keltham knew that complicated things possessed the hidden order of being made of simpler parts and in dath ilan knowledge of this fact was power Hes not quite sure that the same also holds true of Golarion but Keltham did do some preliminary checks and was told for example that snowflakes have hexagonal symmetry Keltham knows the hidden order underlying snowflakes in dath ilan the tiny pieces that nestled together in sixfold symmetry there so hes guessing that snowflakes have the same hidden order in Golarion And by extension that Kelthams own body has the same hidden orders of the same kind rather than having been remade and rewritten on his arrival here There are a lot of hidden orders invoked within a dath ilani body It is a further guess though not a certain one that Golarion possesses all the same hidden orders of that kind that the things here that Keltham recognizes are ultimately made out of the same tiny parts that Keltham knows

In Kelthams world they dont have spells some of the hidden orders here must have been absent from Kelthams world In Kelthams world when you want to go from one place to another place very far away you get into a huge metal structure with fixed wings and powerful engines that push out air behind it thrusting that aeroplane forwards to fly across oceans and continents To build something like that you have to understand the hidden orders of metal in order to build sufficiently strong metal You have to understand the hidden orders of fire in order to find dense enough fuels that burn hot enough for the fuel on board the aeroplane to last for flying across the continent But these hidden orders are invariant within dath ilan they work for everyone not just spellcasters They arent truths about the people using the aeroplane theyre truths about metal and fire For a quarter of a days income you can buy a ticket for an aeroplane trip across a pretty large ocean going slightly less fast than the speed of sound in air and get to the next continent in a quarter day or half day Keltham is not sure how much it costs to teleport the same distance here but he gets the impression it is more expensive than that Artifacts that exploit dath ilan style hidden orders can be made without spellcasters They are economically scalable That is part of the change that Keltham hopes to bring to Golarion and driving back the demons of the Worldwound will only be the bare beginning of its consequences

But even if that part doesnt work out because the snowflakes it may turn out are only a misleading resemblance born of other pathways theres knowledge Keltham has which is more valuable than that and which is even more likely to hold here a collection of hidden orders that might hold even everywhere though it is hard to be quite certain of that without observing everywhere

This is the knowledge of the Laws governing attempts to think which have the character of wait Keltham hasnt explained the difference between empirical truths and necessary truths Does everyone here already happen to know the difference between empirical truths and necessary truths Hes kind of guessing not based on some previous exchanges about 2 2 5 if not he can cover that too The notion of Validity is as good a place as any to give an example of Laws governing thought

His audience is very attentive Chelish school emphasizes not being disruptive or wasting the time of the best students by being one of the worst ones no one has any questions 

No one knows the difference between empirical truths and necessary truths though from context one girl is willing to venture that empirical truths are those that can differ between planes and necessary truths must be ones that hold everywhere

Keltham is glad to see that anyone is paying attention Good for guessing he says which is a common phrase in dath ilan Now Im not quite sure how you define plane here but consider In dath ilan no other plane has ever to my knowledge interacted with our own To see a thing is to have it affect you weve never seen any other planes seen anything else that has shown signs of interacting with another plane and so on We are sensible people who prefer not to believe things for no reason How would we know that a truth was universal Why would we even have a word for that Even if you saw that something was true across every plane youd ever visited how would you make the jump from there to thinking it was true across all planes Does anyone want to venture another guess Its better to be wrong out loud than to be silent as the saying goes

Well if its better to be wrong out loud then theyll do that

Maybe you can figure out the set of all possible physical laws that could support intelligent creatures and then if its true in all of those its true everywhere relevant

You could like figure out the set of changes you could make to our plane where itd still be true and if itd be true no matter what you changed then itd be true everywhere 

Even if youve only got one plane youd still have multiple planets and they might differ on some things but not others 

The topic of which laws support intelligent life is a separate interesting topic we probably wont get to it today Were interested in things that stay true even in planes with no intelligent life Can you come up with an example of something that has to stay true no matter what laws of the planes you change

 all first circle spells have to be structurally isomorphic

Their world doesnt have magic

So they wouldnt do anything but theyd still be isomorphic

There could be a world with more dimensions for stuff to pass through itself

One equals one

Now theres something that might be true everywhere which you might think would make it an important fact and if its important then its important to know exactly what it is thats true everywhere So what do you mean when you say that one equals one

I mean Im not at all sure its an important fact its mostly just saying that we defined equals and the way we defined equals the things on both sides of it are the same and things are the same as themselves But it does seem like itd be true everywhere

Its something of a mischievous question but mischief is also important in learning so Ill ask One common way to ask what something means is to ask what you experience when that proposition is true If you say water is liquid for example and I ask you what that means you might tell me that water describes the clear stuff inside a glass you hold up and that liquid means that a substance tries to cling to itself but has no set shape and so conforms itself to the shape of its container and when I see you pour the water from the glass onto the floor I should expect to see it spread out across the floor while still locally clinging to itself and staying in contiguous puddles Now what do you see when one equals one

This is SO STRESSFUL 

If you use a spell to duplicate something itll have all the same properties as the original

You dont see anything its just a definition

Things exist at all thatd imply its not true in the Maelstrom though 

If you try to do math and you assume it your math will keep making sense

Positive reinforcement for continuing to be wrong instead of quiet Now really I only told you half of a proverb just then The real proverb says that to ask what a proposition means we ask what you should see thats different depending on whether the proposition is true or false Yesterday water was liquid tomorrow water wont be liquid How are yesterday and tomorrow different Well yesterday when I poured water from the cup it spread out over the floor in puddles where it clung to itself So if tomorrow I pour out water and it stays in the same shape as when it left the cup then tomorrow water is liquid is false Yesterday you used a spell to duplicate something lets say a small flower a dandelion and the duplicate dandelion seemed just the same as the original Tomorrow you use a spell to duplicate a dandelion and the resulting flower is blue instead of yellow Is one no longer equal to one tomorrow Yesterday one equaled one tomorrow it wont What will you see tomorrow thats different from yesterday

AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH

I dont think tomorrow sustains conscious life thats observing things

Thats a cop out whatever youre scrying the place where this is true

I still think you try to do math and your math doesnt work anymore

Tomorrow it wont cant be true

Cant be true Well if it cant be true that something is false that would make it a necessary truth I suppose Dath ilan might imagine that itd managed to deduce what was true in all planes if it couldnt be false But if for that reason you cant tell me what you expect to see what will happen to you as a consequence does your necessary truth really mean anything After all if it meant only some things could happen to you but not others it would cease to be true if you traveled to a plane where other things happened to you instead So whatever is true no matter what happens to you never helps you figure out what will happen to you and therefore is absolutely useless Now I have just proven to you that all necessary truths are absolutely useless And some of you have suggested that math is made of necessary truths So have you just proved that math is absolutely useless since whatever could happen to you that wouldnt make math false and therefore math can never say anything about what will happen

Otolmens is watching this classroom SO HARD right now The mortal had BETTER not be going anywhere weird with this Physics disasters are BAD but math disasters are SO MUCH WORSE

You can use math to derive how to move a spell and then the spell works or it doesnt

And target a catapult

And build a bridge

If I have one hat and one head one equalling one means that after I have put the hat on the head there wont be any spare hats or any spare heads It seems possible to imagine observing instead that if you have one of something and one of another thing it doesnt mean they match up to each other with none going spare

The group is divided on whether this is in fact possible to imagine 

Just to check Carissa Sevar can you describe to me in additional detail what youd imagine it to be like to observe that

Keltham has had a pretty strange couple of days and is in fact less sure of some things than he used to be

I mean if it happened Id assume someone was messing with my head or I was dreaming but well imagine instead we have five weapons and five spots on a weapons rack its not hard to imagine that you put a weapon in each slot but then theres still one slot left over and you go back and count and there are five slots one of them empty and you count the weapons and there are five all in a rack Its harder to imagine with one because in dreams sometimes counting to five doesnt quite work but counting to one still does

Saying those words out loud is one thing could you create a detailed illusion of it happening

Not a motionless one I bet I could do one that took advantage of how people cant look at a whole landscape at the same time and changed where they werent looking at it Youd just be tricking them though even if you did it perfectly you wouldnt have changed what one equalled

If its not possible to create an illusion of something being false you might not need to travel to other planes to guess it would be true there But I offer the same mischievous objection as before To say that you cant make an illusion of something doesnt narrow down what kind of future follows from the past we can make an illusion of a plane where jumping up puts you at the bottom of an ocean instead of off the ground Even if in all previous history jumping just lifted you off the ground a bit we can make a detailed illusion of a world where that happens the first trillion times and on the trillion and first time jumping teleports you under the ocean instead So if math is about truths we cant make even an illusion deny then why is math any good for building bridges We can make an illusion of a bridge falling down

They are so confused and varying degrees of distressed about it

Actual bridges fall down more if you did the math wrong

Making an illusion of casting a spell isnt the same thing as actually casting the spell sometimes the way to pass the test is to be able to actually do it not just to make it look like you can 

Keltham does not have the faintest chance of noticing that somebody who did well in a Chelish academy is leaking tiny signs of distress past their routine concealment thereof

Well I think Ive created enough explicit confusion that youll notice learning something that makes you feel less confused Keltham says and then makes a brief sad face about how this snappy statement sounds so ridiculously long in Taldane What kind of language makes confusion a three syllable word anyways One that has no idea what its nearly neural level cognitive primitives are presumably

Keltham goes to the improvised whiteboard and starts drawing squares and triangles red and green large and small inside some bigger blue circles

Consider each of these blue circles and their contents as depicting we would say in Baseline possible worlds By possible I dont mean its especially likely that youll find yourselves in them these possible worlds Im depicting are much too tiny to support intelligent life Theyve only got a few squares and triangles inside By possible I do mean that one could make a fully detailed illusion of the world given the ability to cast arbitrarily large illusions my using markers to draw a world in complete detail similarly shows that world to be possible Now consider these propositions 

Keltham writes in black marker

Z All triangular things are red
H All red things are large
Q All triangular things are large

Dath ilan has some different conventions for symbols to use in equations for example all the symbols should be as topologically and typographically distinct as possible

As you can see I have shown worlds where Z is true and worlds where Z is false I have shown worlds where H is true and worlds where H is false I have shown worlds where Q is true and worlds where Q is false None of Z H and Q then are necessary truths nor necessary falsehoods for they are all true in some illusionable worlds and false in others Then is there anything useful here for math logic and necessity to say

It takes a couple of minutes of muttering and frowning and guessing no and there are triangular things in all the world oh no not that one before well if Z and H are true then Q is you cant have any with Z and H but not Q

That took them longer than Keltham expected He frankly would not have expected that all the exercises he had to do as a kid were like required for getting that point instantaneously as an adult Not to mention they know topology but not predicate logic Right because you need topology for spells but not apparently predicate logic If hed realized he sure wouldve told them to learn that in yesterday evenings afterhours instead of calculus Oh well hell plunge on and see how far he gets

Keltham goes to the whiteboard and draws some conscious observers inside his blue circle worlds Much as some other world might indicate observers with smiley faces dath ilani convention calls for Keltham to draw a number of glaring eyes inside his worlds creating a tableau that somebody from a differently troped world might regard as eldritch

Well now Ive put some conscious observers inside these worlds Not that my tiny drawings embody real experiences of course theyre not detailed enough drawings for that so now these pictures are no longer being drawn in full detail which is something we might need to watch out for if this was a more complicated debate about conscious experiences

Some of these observers in the worlds where Z is actually true might see twenty triangles being red and zero triangles being green and hypothesize a general law all triangles are red They might be able to deduce without having to actually scry into other planes that Z was not a necessary truth they might be able to cast illusions draw on walls or just use their imaginations to see that So they would not be certain that all triangles are red For all they know the world might up and present them one day with a green triangle But the next time they saw a triangle even if their world made them slower to see colors than shapes they could guess even in advance of observing they would guess the triangle was red

Lets also suppose that you can tell whether an object is small or large but its an expensive measurement an observer has to actually wander over close to the object to determine its size because if theyre looking at the object from a distance theyre not sure if its nearby and small or large and far away These observers have only one eye as you can see no binocular vision for tracking distances Lets say they have to pay one labor one silver piece each time they want to move to an object

In worlds where H is true observers who pay to measure a few red things will find that of all the red things they have measured every one of those red things was large

Now let me ask again in case anyone has seen the point before I speak it How can knowing necessary truths save you money

Well if you know that triangles are red and that red things are large then you dont have to go check the size of triangles

To state it precisely some observers may have guessed the unnecessary truth that all triangles are red observing the redness after the delay They may have separately guessed the unnecessary truth that all red things are large after paying to measure some red things Maybe theyve never measured any of the red things that were triangles we can suppose for the sake of clarity Then the necessary truth Q is true in all worlds where Z and H is true can allow them to guess the unnecessary truth All triangles are large which necessarily follows from other unnecessary truths theyve guessed And even if theyve never measured the size of a single triangle before they can guess though not know for certain that every triangle theyve seen was large and that the next triangle they see will be large If its the kind of knowledge that matters but not enough that you need to be very sure of it they could use that guess in place of paying a silver piece to measure it

Of course it isnt a necessary truth that the observers are capable of figuring this all out that they can operate the necessity Z and H yield Q We could draw an illusion of a world where the observers totally fail to figure that out It would still be true across all planes and all illusions that could ever be drawn in full detail but the people in that illusion wouldnt know it

It isnt necessary that entities successfully operate universal necessities in order to see which new guesses must follow from old guesses which means that some entities do better or worse at this than others This is true when considering all possible worlds as a whole and also happens to be true within my homeworld and almost certainly in this one

So now we shall turn to the question suppose you were constructing a new entity from scratch How would you go about embedding in them an internal reflection of the interuniversal Law the ability to operate necessary truths correctly No sorry thats probably too much of a leap to ask in one go Strike that restart Suppose you were comparing two entities how would you say that one was doing better or worse than the other at being Lawful in this exact sense

 Keltham hasnt noticed but his teaching style clearly has half the class extremely panicked They are concealing it very well

 it really seems bizarre that you could teach Law this way with trick questions and guessing games and strange rules about how youre supposed to volunteer wrong answers if you arent sure you know the right one It seems like the habits of mind that would teach are well does she actually think that itd teach unLawful habits of mind or just horrendously ill advised ones there is a difference 

 if you built a military out of Kelthams it would not be a very good military which is a perfectly serviceable definition of Law the discipline and coordination required to win wars The Kelthams and plausibly the people taught like Keltham would be wrong a lot out loud and cheerfully theyd consider everything their business theyd ask questions they shouldnt ask 

 he did behave differently with Contessa Lliratha maybe theres a kind of distinction the mind can successfully maintain irreverent in most contexts but deferential where it actually matters but it seems like it would be hard to tell if someone will be deferential when it actually matters if theyve spent their entire life in contexts where it doesnt not being sufficiently deferential at all 

You could look at how good they were at making those guesses How often when they guessed they were right how often they missed a pattern 

Measuring how good people are at guessing final conclusions in reality whether when they say I assign 90 probability this triangle is large the triangle is actually large 9 times out of 10 sure is a metric of how much Law people contain and are using correctly But theres more than one kind of Law you need to build an agent and the piece of Law were trying to isolate is the one thats about using necessary truths correctly One way of looking at that part is that its about which conclusions follow from which premises To demonstrate 

Keltham has seen one or two fragments of algebra in his reading enough that he has some idea of what Chelish algebra conventions look like Though its a bit weird that they teach algebra without like teaching people what algebra means Hopefully its not a piece of knowledge thats infohazardous here but not in dath ilan

He sketches a series of equations

Otolmens is now in EMERGENCY PANIC OVERDRIVE which you would be able to distinguish from her usual state of being if you looked carefully This particular proof of an inconsistency in first order arithmetic is safely flawed but if the foreign mortal is plotting to produce a valid proof of inconsistency why wont they move the mortal somewhere prophecy still works

She cant trust Abadar anymore fellow Lawful Neutral god or not Abadar might not be useful in this emergency even if she could trust Him Hes scarcely better at decoding mortal minds than Herself 

Otolmens sends a message reading simply HELP tagged with a location

Now Im not so much asking What is the flaw in this proof Keltham is saying now that hes given the classroom the few required seconds to look over his derivations as asking How would you go about finding the flaw if you couldnt spot it at a glance or on your first try at looking

Irori has never once received an emergency summons from Otolmens that was actually important

He nonetheless maintains a habit of responding with alacrity just in case The concept of anthropic selection is not lost on him and zero urgent summonses from Otolmens is not quite as reassuring as a mortal might think

Yes

You USED to be a MORTAL I request you to read this mortals mind and inform me whether it is plotting to write down a series of VALID proof steps proving an inconsistency in first order arithmetic

Otolmens isnt sure for obvious reasons of resulting inconsistency but She suspects that She internally uses ordinal induction up to epsilon zero Theyd have to boot up Metatolmens to fix Her

Ex mortal or not from where Irori truly stands far above Golarion and other places it isnt easy for Him to look inside the mind of a mortal not pledged to Himself and praying Otolmens only needs to pay attention to relatively few things going on inside the multiverse and then She is a relatively materially focused entity on top of that designed to be able to check all the electrons in a room to make sure none of them have the wrong mass Irori if He hasnt formed an avatar and sent it into the room cannot read the writing on the whiteboard the way Otolmens can He can barely tell that these souls are in a library surrounded by books He definitely cant hear the sounds the pressure patterns transmitted through the air as vibrations

Still it is Otolmens who calls and the mortal is more Lawful Neutral than usual even for those that register Lawful Neutral

From the mortals general spiritual posture Irori can already guess what Hell see But just in case Irori expends the energy to take a very brief look at the surface of the mortals mind Its not as difficult as it would be at other times of this mortals life given his current endeavors

 hes not planning to destroy mathematics He only intends to teach of his Way to others

Irori shifts most of His delegated attention back to other aspects of His businesses leaving only a tiny fragment to look at the Chelish place a bit longer

 Irori shifts somewhat more of His attention back to that location

Carissa feels that she could grasp what Keltham is pointing at a lot faster if she were reading his mind but thats disallowed now hes a fourth circle caster and reasonably likely to notice She cant even ask him whether itd be all right if she read his mind because they havent acknowledged mindreading to be a thing that magic can do

It remains bizarre to think that Law has anything to do with formal mathematical logic You dont need to understand the gods to be Lawful you just need to obey them But but Kelthams world is more Lawful than hers and 

 so theres nothing heretical about the claim that humans are using a mediocre approximation of Law which is a god concept that doesnt mean quite what humans understand it to mean And theres nothing heretical about the idea that humans ought to use the real thing except that theyre too stupid and limited to understand it so they have to settle for their wrong approximations And theres nothing very heretical about the claim that actually theres a way to teach humans the real thing despite their stupidity and limitations at least to teach smart humans to teach humans in Kelthams world with a median INT of 16 or 17 and the people in this room have a median INT of 16 or 17 so the people in this room can learn it 

And the true structure of Law would be mathematical because its about regularities consistencies treaties among the gods arent promises so much as fundamental changes becoming the kind of structure of which the promise is true and there is actually an obvious parallel to math there even if she cant properly articulate it The way the gods are is inevitable in many ways they vary much less than humans because there is only one way to be right and many many ways to be wrong 

And the gods wouldnt be very suited to figure out what math specifically to teach to humans especially if it requires obnoxiously counterintuitive tactics like making everyone limp their way through the lesson guessing and perhaps too this wouldnt even have been worth trying anywhere in the world until quite recently you need a bunch of smart people in a room and Cheliax is the first society in recorded history to look for all their smart children and teach them math 

Well youd know there has to be an error somewhere since you got it wrong

You could check each line and see where the error showed up first 

Check each line to see where the error showed up first How would you check a line for error

 well theres obviously a problem in the eighth line where if you substitute in 1 for X and Y youve got the error already And theres not a problem in the seventh line because that one comes out to 20 10 Which is true

Keltham takes a quick look at the nametag of whoever that was Why the Chelians collectively aced this problem but not the predicate logic one presumably its just down to more actual practice with algebra

Precisely If we substitute in 1 for x and y and evaluate the left hand sides and right hand sides of each equation we get the following assertions

The tactics of algebra like being allowed to add 3 to both sides of an equation are meant to preserve truth not create it from scratch If an equation starts out true a tactic in algebra should not produce a false equation from that true equation

This way of thinking holds even if the elements of the equation refer to things in the outside world Let x be the number of people sitting in the brown chair 2 as it happens and let y be the number of people sitting in the red chair currently 3 It is then an unnecessary truth not a necessary truth that x 1 y as I have defined those terms to refer to the outside world In our world x 1 y evaluates to 33 which happens to be true but if you cast an illusion showing two people sitting in the brown chair and two people sitting in the red chair the equation in that world would evaluate to 3 2 which is false And if I said x 10 y that would be an unnecessary falsehood in our world it evaluates to the false statement 12 3

Now apply the rules of algebra add 2 to both sides and transform the first equation x 1 y to the new equation x 3 y 2 In our world this evaluates to 5 5 which is again true If we apply the same tactic to x 10 y it yields x 12 y 2 which evaluates to 145 again false

We term a step of inference valid when it is truth preserving when it transforms true statements into only other true statements It doesnt have to preserve falsehood multiplying both sides of an equation by zero will produce truth even where it didnt previously exist

What makes the tactic of adding 2 to both sides of an equation allowed in math is not that some Watcher or representative from Governance told you it was allowed This part got hammered into Keltham and his agemates a lot as a kid so it was probably determined to be important in practice to emphasize What makes it an allowed step is that if you have two weights balanced on either side of a scales and you add two identical rocks to both the left side and the right side the scales will still balance after that

If you look back at the original flawed proof that 21 it goes from a true statement in step 7 to a false statement in step 8 Then between 7 and 8 we must have applied some operation of inference which is not valid which has the ability to take in a true statement and spit out a false statement This tactic was canceling the multiplication by x y from both sides which is to say dividing both sides by x y Dividing both sides of an equation by 2 is valid if you have a scales in balance and remove half the weight from each sides of a scale it will still be in balance Here we see that division by 0 is not valid because it can produce falsehood from truth What makes division by 0 unlawful is not that your Watcher told you not to do it while doing algebra it is that division by 0 is not generally truth preserving We can find some equations that will still be true after dividing both sides by a term equal to 0 but it is not a safe step in general

Sorry if that part about Watchers seems overly obvious by the way Its just that apparently human brains by default try to reuse the part of ourselves that learns from adults not to steal cookies outside of mealtimes or well get slapped on the wrist in order to relate to the rules for manipulating necessary truths that existed outside the start of Time And these are actually quite different topics like rules change sometimes when Legislators vote on them but algebra doesnt So you want to be explicitly aware of the difference and not go bugging adults to let you divide by zero just this once

So the argument is that part of Law is the habits of mind so you only reason in truth preserving ways Meritxell who was also fastest on the algebra says 

I am still not entirely sure what the word Lawful means to yall Multiple different words in my native language all come out as Lawful in Taldane and Im mostly running with those Cheliax is supposedly a Lawful country but the books are written with what look to me like appalling jumps of reasoning and somebody seems to have taught yall algebra without teaching you what math is or why it works But Lrilatha whose job title I already forgot is supposed to be more innately Lawful and she did not talk with those appalling jumps in her reasoning Which suggests to me that the word Lawful is translating to me mostly correctly or that the concept I hear is at least a real part of what Lawfulness is and the humans here simply are not being taught about that part of Lawfulness or how to flow along with it on purpose instead of by accident

That said not being taught something is not the same as having none of it inside you Your eyes can see without you being taught how the part of the mind that handles vision is doing the work it does And if you could never see the implications of other guesses youd already made you wouldnt get far enough in life to reproduce Everyone here has bits and pieces of them that imperfectly echo the shard of Law about which conclusions follow from which premises I also happen to have studied that Law explicitly and went through standard training for not being quite as messy about it Thats part of the process that dath ilan went through to put together aeroplanes that could fly across oceans We arent perfect at it to be clear just better than whoever wrote the so called books in this library I really want to see what happens if we match up Lrilatha against a Keeper one of the people from my world who are actually specialized in being more perfect reflections of Law but I doubt well ever get a chance to try

 you think that in a Lawful country all the books should only use truth preserving arguments someone says somewhat dumbfounded

It makes sense though Mortals didnt have free will Now they do and it displeases Asmodeus but no one has a complete account of what free will is because theyre not gods and dont understand what exactly displeases Asmodeus But that might just be it Gods innately reason in truth preserving ways Of course they would Lying to yourself for self preservation is a thing you only have to do if you have wrong beliefs and cant argue yourself out of them because you dont know the counterarguments and so you have to stop thinking about them That is not a problem gods have Gods just reason correctly And in Kelthams world theres still the concept of infohazards things youre not supposed to learn presumably because youre only human and cant properly have the kind of mind that entertains that fact in a way that allows for continued useful functioning 

 something about that frame isnt quite right but despite that she feels like everything is coming together

Minds should reason in truth preserving ways Someone a long time ago robbed humans of that and Asmodeus is angry Carissa is angry That was her birthright and she wants it back And Asmodeus thought until Keltham arrived that the scars theyd wrought on human souls could only be corrected in Hell or at least could most cheaply for Asmodeus be corrected in Hell but in Kelthams world where humans do not magically reason in truth preserving ways they figured out possibly over many thousands of years of careful experiments how to teach it And Asmodeus saw that and immediately told them not to hurt Keltham because 

 okay that line of thought shes going to tuck away for later it seems maybe ill advised Sufficient that Keltham got Asmodeuss endorsement immediately

Minds should reason in truth preserving ways The books ought to have good arguments Devils are masters of propaganda but arent convinced by it Carissa doesnt think of herself as convinced by it the books are really presenting their conclusions not their arguments but but thats because the books think humans arent doing reasoning well enough to be persuaded by argument and humans can learn that At least smart ones And if they knew it then you could just argue everyone out of all the heresies their minds wouldnt possess the weaknesses that make that strategy doomed that make it necessary to present them with conclusions they wont be able to understand Or at least less of it Keltham did have the concept of things he was not meant to learn 

More things that suddenly make sense what the Starstone does to you why it changes some people more than others Godhood even more than devilhood would preserve you to the extent that you are worth preserving to the extent that you have learned the processes of reasoning Irori ascended just by becoming perfect and everyone writes that off as a strange one off that only Irori could do but in dath ilan they teach it 

It has to be done all at once she realizes Theres a terrible middle ground where you are trying to reason things out but you are incompetent to do it and so you run right into all the heresies that you could have been protected from by not trying to reason You would absolutely fail a loyalty check in the middle of trying to learn how to think But at the end of it Asmodeus arrived at His beliefs through reason And He hates it that humans were changed so they cant and He wants them changed back

She rereads everything on the board though theres not much written on the board The new thing shes learned here isnt that there are necessary truths and empirical truths or that you shouldnt divide by zero its that it is possible for humans to learn how to reason well enough theyre better off trying it

If you found yourself in an unfamiliar country and you opened up a book and it was like The sky is green How do we know this Because teddy bears are cute My dad once bought me a cookie would you suspect you were in a Chaotic country or a Lawful one Now I admit this example is unrealistic generalizing from my reading experiences a Chelish author would never explicitly ask How do we know this And yes Im sure places outside of Cheliax are even sillier but your book authors are still all very silly and if Lrilatha had infinite free time I would lock all of them in a room with her until they learned better

Thats kind of what Hell is someone offers The other people who were totally thinking that but not sure if they were allowed to say it giggle 

The Worldwound isnt in Hell its here And I dont know why you cant have people train in Lawfulness in the whole post life thing for a few years and then resurrect them here if thats a thing in the first place or why Lrilatha hasnt been able to train teachers who could train teachers who could train you But the Worldwound isnt in Hell its here and its this world that needs to become saner and wealthier and better at repelling demons or die 

Those questions dont sound like theyre meant to answer them Instead they nod vigorously 

 no actually she thinks theyre meant to answer that Or she thinks they ought to regardless of whether theyre meant to Becoming a devil in Hell takes centuries she says You cant be resurrected after that long Its been widely assumed there just wasnt any way to make a useful amount of progress on being Lawful the way devils are in a human lifetime Or in time to close the Worldwound But it seems to me that the reason Asmodeus intervened directly to tell us to make this a priority is that the way you know is a lot faster

Asmodeus would also bet significant resources on that even if he only estimated a small probability of it working so lets not get overconfident But yeah I dont know how long dath ilan took to get where we did starting from scratch and baseline we had to screen off our history for reasons that are apparently also infohazardous to know about But the pieces all fit together and you should be able to complete the whole thing once you have enough hints from me Even if theres no spell to give me perfect recollection of all the training I went through Im hoping it should be possible to get like 80 of the benefit from going off my memory of hopefully the most critical parts Not to mention youre not all 8 years old and that should count for something when it comes to learning this part a little faster

Keltham turns back toward the whiteboard completely unconscious of any effect the declaration about 8 year olds mightve had on the rest of his audience who are all concealing their reactions anyways

When it comes to algebra over continuous quantities Keltham says gesturing at the tactics written between the steps of the equations we have rules like being allowed to multiply both sides by the same quantity or divide both sides by the same quantity so long as it isnt zero If you imagine building a mind to reason inside a universe that was full of hidden order that could be described by algebra if it was an observer surrounded by like piles of fruit containing twice as many cherries as apples that sort of thing it was just how that world worked then you could imagine building that mind with rules like If I believe an equation I should also believe that equation with both sides multiplied by the same quantity or If I believe an equation I can believe that equation with both sides divided by the same quantity so long as I already believe that quantity isnt zero I say this to introduce a new topic the concept of hidden order within the rules of reasoning themselves There are hidden patterns and deep explanations to be found in this subject matter as in my world there was a reason why snowflakes had sixfold symmetry

As a very simple example the rule You can divide by nonzero quantities can be seen as a pure special case of You can multiply by any quantity To say you can divide both sides by 2 is the same as saying you can multiply both sides by 1 2 The reason you cant divide both sides by zero is that zero is the only continuous quantity which lacks an inverse Once you see things from that angle in fact you might say that its a simpler viewpoint to say that theres just one rule to use there about valid inference in algebra the rule that you can multiply both sides by any quantity Say just that and you dont need that darned rule with the extra complication about Oh well you can divide by anything unless it might be zero You just have the rule that you can multiply by anything and the rule that everything except zero has an inverse You could also add the rule about division nothing invalid would happen to you if you did but it would be redundant the mind you were constructing could reach the same conclusions either way Through perceiving hidden order in the rules of reasoning you would be able to simplify the minds thought processes and arrive to the same ends though it might also take longer to reason that way it might take extra steps if you eliminated the extra rule

But meanwhile back in the real world we deal more with the equivalent of triangles and red things than the equivalent of numbers and addition I mean this world has both but still lets go back to shapes and colors and sizes What sort of truth preserving rules analogous to you can multiply both sides by any quantity in algebra might we use to combine beliefs like these

Z All triangular things are red
H All red things are large

All triangular things are large

Why are they so inconsistently math

Thats the conclusion you want yes what rules did you follow and what road did you walk to get there If you were making a child from scratch and you stood too far back of the childs future situation to know exactly what situations they would encounter or what conclusions they would need how would you make the child to reason to Q from Z and H

This question is somehow really confusing to them

 well if all triangular things are red and all red things are large then you cant have a triangular thing that isnt large thatd mean something was triangular and not red or red and not large

Ah well that is a very persuasive argument I am totally persuaded But what rule are you using to find this persuasive what shard of structure embedded within me leads me to find it persuasive Is it the sort of rule that has some important exception we need to know about like not being able to divide by zero Does it only work sometimes and sometimes give wrong results Is it maybe a bit of complete nonsense that somehow got embedded into both of us causing us to both arrive at the same wrong conclusions If we dont even know what rules were following how could we begin to tell Imagine getting to Hell and being locked in a room with Lrilatha and now she has to explain everything youre doing wrong only you dont know what youre doing at all and she has trouble empathizing because Im guessing all the nonsense in our heads is contrary to her own nature Think of how much of her valuable time you could save her not to mention your own time locked in the room if you actually knew which rules were operating inside you to cause you to be persuaded by arguments like that one So what renders persuasive Z and H implies Q or your own statement for there to be a non large triangle implies either a non red triangle or a non large red thing how would you construct an entity from scratch to be persuaded by a statement like that

These people are stunningly motivated to skip through as much as is possible of the being locked in a room with a frustrated devil once they die They are very aware that it will suck and they are so eager to get to do less of it They do not understand Kelthams question at all 

An entity that wasnt doing that kind of reasoning would be really bad at inference and waste a lot of time

Kids will just naturally pick it up they actually tend to overgeneralize I have a kid sister whod say things like all boys have long hair after shed seen three 

I think itd have an exception for like cases where were using the words differently in different contexts like if we say all criminals are punished and all punishments are painful that doesnt mean all criminals are painful 

Even Keltham has managed to pick up on the rise in energy levels in the room Hes not sure why this math marketing tactic is so much more effective than other marketing tactics in Cheliax but hes willing to roll with it Though he should probably also be careful not to overuse it whatever the ass it is hes doing especially when he has no idea why its working He sets aside a question about what kind of game theory criminals use here and what sort of bizarre equilibrium results to an enormous ill organized heap of similar plaintive questions

Keltham goes over to one of the few remaining empty spaces on the wall whiteboard hed rather not have it laundry magicked clean just yet

Z All male objects have long hair
H All long haired objects wear shirts

When youre confused one of the macro reasoning strategies is to find the smallest simplest problems that still contain your confusion Can you state a general rule like Its okay to add 2 to both sides of any equation that covers how to combine Z and H which also says how to combine Z and H without explicitly mentioning Z and H Like stating a rule for adding 2 to both sides of an equation which doesnt mention the particular equation youre using That takes on some of the challenge of creating an agent wholl reason in the world when you dont know which particular equations or statements that agent will encounter

You mean like change the sentences to all somethings have a trait all things with a trait have a second trait 

Well yes You dont have to work out the entire hidden order all at once in order to make progress on it a piece at a time speaking of macro reasoning strategies Before youve worked out that its okay to add any quantity to a balanced equation its fine to start by noticing just that its okay to add 2 specifically to any balanced equation Thats a legitimate step towards starting to put the pieces together for yourself

Require Z generalized All objects with trait 1 have trait 2
Require H generalized All objects with trait 2 have trait 3
Conclude Q generalized All objects with trait 1 have trait 3

When you build an entity with a rule in its mind that looks for a case where it believes any instance of Z generalized and H generalized and concludes Q generalized youre building an entity thats operating a much broader necessary truth than the very narrow universal truth that connects If all triangles are red and all red things are large then all triangles are large You might be able to build a few dozen fairly general rules like that into a mind whose outputs feed into each other as inputs and have thereby given it a noticeably sized shard of the Law that connects premises and conclusions instead of just a very narrow guideline about shapes and sizes in particular

Does anyone want to try naming another candidate for a belief manipulating rule like that

 theres the opposite like no objects with trait 1 have trait 2 Or uh I guess youd want no objects with trait 1 have trait 2 All objects with trait 2 have trait 3 No objects with trait one no that doesnt actually hold 

No objects with trait 1 have trait 2 All objects with trait 3 have trait 2 No objects with trait 1 have trait 3 another girl says a little too competitively for this to sound like helpfully supplementing the first ones train of thought

Well Im starting to run out of room on this wall so forgive me if I write that down in dath ilani shorthand says Keltham

 z t1z t2z
 h t3h t2h

q t1q t3q

Now this is a valid reasoning rule to be sure says Keltham but just like dividing over a balanced equation can be seen as multiplying by an inverse I think we dont need to add this whole rule to our entity The form of this rule looks really quite similar in some ways to that earlier rule about Z generalized H generalized and Q generalized I think we can add a smaller new rule to our entity which already has that previous rule and get this rule back out as a special case like adding the inverse operation to an algebra that already has the rule about multiplying over a balanced equation and automatically getting out the power to divide over a balanced equation

I dont predict based on your past performance that you can derive the missing rule on your own but beliefs like that ought to be tested rather than just assumed Wanna surprise me

Theyre so upset not to get it Theyre not getting it though Theyre distracted by trying to follow the dath ilan notation and theyre not quite generalizing far enough proposing variants on the rule that arent actually simpler 

Its encouraging that his students arent showing any visible sign of emotional disturbance at the prediction or at failing to overcome it they have some traces of dath ilani dignity at least Keltham was wondering whether a lack of training in dignity would require him to back off a little on challenges like those but his students dignity is unperturbed so far as he can see

 h t3h t2h

h t2h t3h

So long as we have this reasoning tactic in our tactical repertoire go ahead and take a moment to convince yourself that you couldnt cast an illusion violating it we can combine it with our previous rule to get the combined rule we wanted

1 z t1z t2z Premise
2 h t3h t2h Premise

3 h t2h t3h one persons modus ponens is another persons modus tollens 2

4 q t1q t3q syllogism 1 3

Anyone want to propose yet another universal rule Heres some shorthand language to help you express yourself

bluek redk k is blue or k is red
bluek redk k is blue and k is not red
k bluek redk for every k it is not the case that k is blue and k is red
bluek smallk if k is blue then k is small
bluek it isnt wrong that k is not blue

They take a while just to figure out how the symbols work and then theyre full of ideas

k bluek V bluek

bluek bluek

bluek bluek That doesnt count Yes it does its like the 1 1 thing

Except were not really using blue to mean anything right we can just write those with t like dath ilan does it

Now theyre thinking with average intelligence While theyre doing that Keltham will helpfully write down some statements for them to decide on as valid or not valid

p q p p

If p then q if its true that if p then q then p if its true that if p then q then p then p Uh I think thats not true Like if p isnt true then 

Its basically just saying is p being true required from the fact that if its true that okay p q p is not necessarily true it could be like say p is men are immortal and q is they will all become ninth circle wizards so obviously you can have p q but p is false 

Thats not what its asking Its saying if p q does imply p then does that mean p is always true

 nooo Like okay whats something where p q implies p Im just not sure thats a thing at all

I think I see the problem The Taldane word implies probably means all sorts of vague things besides anyways Lets use material implication to narrowly denote the particular kind of implies I used here Now were going to have to erase this wall soon but lets look back at the blue circles In particular lets look at this blue circle containing a large red triangle a large blue square a small blue square and a large red square The way I define material implication we can take the statement For all z z being triangular materially implies z being red and say that its true of every object z including the ones that arent triangles We could look at this small blue square and say of it truthfully if a small blue square is triangular then a small blue square is red the way were defining material implication that symbol I wrote like this Keltham points to a symbol that would be a true thing to say Why define it that way So that the statement over here Keltham points to h redh largeh can be true when we evaluate it at every object h could refer to including the objects that arent red at all If we said that red h materially implies large h was false whenever h wasnt red putting a blue square in the world would mean we could not say of it for every object in the world the redness of that object materially implies its largeness

Now wanna take another shot at if p materially implying q materially implies p then p True across all possible worlds or false in some of them

So pgtq implies p if there arent any p

Well p isnt quantified here its not ranging over possible objects p is here some proposition that could be either true or false not an object with a property like redness So its that p materially implies q whenever p is false whether or not q is true

That seems 

No that makes sense thats like I read a theological argument like that once 

Its very hard for Keltham at this point to predict what Chelish practical topologists will get instantly versus not at all Maybe once hes had longer than a day to experiment and figure it out

Hell give them another couple of half minutes on p q p p but if they havent gotten it by then hell leave coming to a definite decision about that as a homework problem and tell them to get back to inventing other logical rules

p q if p is false and also occasionally if p is true and the world happens to be that way so p q p if the reason p implies q isnt that p is false

Well if p is false then pgtq doesnt imply p it cant since p is false So if pgtq does somehow imply p then that would be because p is true 

No itd be not because p is false but that doesnt mean p is definitely true we just dont know

Theyre still all to external appearances without a lot of experience reading Chelish people very calm and unbothered by this

Ill leave that one as an exercise to try to solve afterwards come back tomorrow with your own best guess even if you havent proven it about whether its necessarily true necessarily false or neither

Now let me present you with a different puzzle one that starts to lead into a higher lesson I was constructing an agent but oops I forgot to give it the or concept Keltham points to where was written Its got all the other concepts here like forall and not implies but darn it I just forgot to give it the or concept Can you form a statement thats equivalent to for every object h h is red or h is blue out of the concepts I did remember to put in So I can explain that important fact to my poor confused entity

 h redh blueh 

Sorry for making you clean up my mess there Keltham adds but the entitys already created and I cant redesign its mind now

Giggles 

For every object h h not red implies h is blue someone calls out almost instantly

Why can they but not nevermind Keltham glances at that nametag

Correct Wait oops I forgot to give them the implies symbol too anything you can do now

That was Asmodia

A implies B is the same as for all h where A is true B is true if I try to write that out I use the implies symbol though 

Kill them and start over

Sorry I screwed up even more theyre already sapient and Governance would take a dim view of killing them Or its Golarion and they just end up in an afterlife anyways and Hell will be annoyed if you made extra work for them

A implies B is the same as not B implies not A that doesnt help 

Construct a C where C is everything that is in both A and B for all h in A h is in C says Meritxell

Where are you getting a both A and B

 I havent sketched out how Id do it yet but Im sure I could its obviously the sort of thing thats not hard to specify 

Without implies though

x is in C if x is in A and x is in B No implies

You do have the and symbol And the forall symbol and the not symbol and the parentheses And the object variable symbols of course and the red and blue function symbols Thats all youve got though you cant bring in Taldane language for describing things beyond that Keltham taps again where the whiteboard now shows with its last gasp of open space h redh blueh 

 h redh blueh redhblueh Patxi ventures

Carissa is being a bad student This is in part because she is no longer in school and no longer feels with aching intensity that the entirety of her being as a person is her perfomance in school and being lashed for inattentiveness doesnt hold the soul consuming horror it once did either It is in part because her mind keeps running ahead she cant always see the answers to the specific questions and probably she should focus her attention on them at some point to crystalize the skill of turning all her thoughts into the crisp precise symbolic bounded versions of them but she can see the broad outlines of what the questions let you do Everything maybe if youre a god If youre a human 

How would you express the best outcome a human can reasonably get is to live such that when they die and go to Hell they are useful For all humans but no shes not really making a claim about all humans shes really only interested in the implications of this question for one human and the other ones are relevant because she knows exactly how exceptional she is there exists a human such that in the space of all eternities for that human ordered by how strongly preferred they are the most preferred is well no it wouldnt be Hell because of all possible eternities there are certainly some better ones 

This is of course not an argument against Hell its not like she could formulate any other important claims about the world either It is an argument against sucking at thinking It is an argument for if there were a book that tried to convince you what would it say 

Indeed or rather we just need the second part a red object counts as red or not blue we dont demand that only one side be true

In that last bit of improvised whiteboard Keltham extends his last equation and then writes down one more on the edge of the wall below

h blueh redh h redh blueh h blueh redh
h blueh redh h redh blueh redh blueh

Now given that if you have not you can make and out of or or make or out of and or make either one out of materially implies why not just design an entity that thinks in terms of implication Why bother making an entity that tends to think in terms of P is true or R is true instead of if P is false then R is true This is not a theoretical question if your mind works anything like mine does your mind sometimes thinks in terms of or and not just implies Youve probably thought using and too Why is a human mind which includes your mind designed so inelegantly

Nervous glances

 because humans were given free will and it was done very haphazardly and made us worse at reasoning like the gods says Tonia when no one else has said anything for a moment

Actually theres something of a questionable assumption Ive been making which is that your biology is a possibly modified version of biology that got copied off of a branch of time I dont think Taldane has a word for it thats very close in branching time to dath ilan I think dath ilan cant see your world cant be affected by it but I did manage to show up in this world at all even if thats a very rare phenomenon So your world can see my world be causally affected by it even if my materializing like this very rarely happens And your bodies look a lot like mine and more importantly I can eat your food without immediately falling over dead which implies a lot of shared hidden order between our biology which wouldnt exist without common ancestry If its possible for me and somebody from this world to have kids which is mostly what Id expect that would absolutely prove the point

Where the point is that while some stuff may have modified you relative to where a dath ilani starts and dath ilan may have developed and diverged some from whenever your biology was copied from our cousin or ancestral world remind me of how old human life on Golarion is again human biology on Golarion is I would strongly guess basically a copy of dath ilani biology Some of my distant ancestors or cousins got materialized here and had kids maybe Or some god read the heredity code for one of us and materialized some entities like that

If all of that is true then the reason your underlying mind design looks like it was slapped together by monkeys on drugs is the same reason our baseline mind design looks like it was slapped together by monkeys on drugs I wasnt born like this we have to give people extensive training to get them to work at all correctly instead of them just working correctly straight out of the womb the way we would if we were designed by sane designers instead of well the thing that actually made us A weird pseudo nonentity that had literally no idea what the ass it was doing Frankly its sort of a big topic here though it sure is a fundamental one so Ill probably get to the details at some time The point is I fully expect that by the time were done in class here you will be looking over your mind design and thinking that you could accidentally sneeze a better mind design than that Im not quite sure what the given free will thing was about the Taldane term free will doesnt translate well into Baseline so we may not have whatever you were given but trust me your speciess mind design was horrible crap even before then You can tell this because I had to go through lessons similar to what youre going through now Though if free will makes you even worse at sanity which sure is plausible given this total mess of a planet I probably need to have that explained to me at some point I dont suppose its easy to describe

Horrified silence

She does not want to interact with this but she has the twin qualifications of being particularly unlikely to be executed for misstepping itd be conspicuous Keltham can definitely tell her apart from everyone else and having spent the last half hour dwelling on it

I dont think I have ever encountered the theory that the gods were copying she says but it does seem odd for there to be a world with a longer history and humans that came about some other way I think that these lessons have helped me make more sense of the free will thing actually It used to be that humans didnt make mistakes of reasoning but also that they didnt have their own goals just the goals of the gods they served It sounds like you think maybe those necessarily went together that it wasnt possible for humans to stop making mistakes of reasoning while being more than automata 

Yeah thatd make its own kind of sense The event your history has down as humans suddenly acquired free will couldve been a magical template superposed on human biology producing agents working for gods and then somehow that magical template stopped working and suddenly you had the original humans again I do not know nearly enough of your history to guess what parts of the template versus original human nature were locked together I am guessing at a lot here Id ask if the magical template made people nonconscious nonexperiencing but I wouldnt expect you to have any way of knowing that given the general fuzziness of your prehistory That whole scenario would actually be a pretty optimistic result from my standpoint It means you dont have additional features making you crazier and dath ilani training should still work on people here with high baseline intelligence

The scenario you described matches all our histories but we dont know details of the magical template aside from that the gods were divided over the change that made it stop working

Yeah Im not going to say details like that are unimportant theyre obviously hugely important and at some point I want to know everything thats known about it but theyre not obviously urgent details especially compared to the general project of me transferring knowledge Golarion will need for industrialization and scaling up to fight the Worldwound

So back to where your mind design actually comes from Ill endeavor to be brief because this lesson is mainly about Validity but now were talking about how shards and reflections of Validity even got into human minds at all and soon were going to ask whether theres maybe something better than the version of Validity we have and Im not sure how you could reason well about those topics if you had no idea where your mind design came from in the first place

This part is actually a pretty simple idea If anything you should be careful not to overthink it You know how a pair of tall parents will probably though not always have a kid whos taller than average And a pair of short parents will probably though not always have a kid whos shorter than average It may help for the sake of concreteness to know that inside you there are extremely tiny extremely long spirals of stuff Taldane doesnt have a name for but capable of encoding information Like imagine theres four kinds of tiny parts that can make up each bit of spiral labeled 0 1 2 and 3 so a section of the spiral might read 1032 that is itd be the second kind of bit connected to the first kind of bit connected to the fourth kind of bit connected to the third kind of bit Each spiral is around three billion of those units long but the parts are so tiny that even three billion of them curled up in spirals are still too tiny to see Your body is full of identical copies of your version and it carries the information that told your body how to develop fingers and toes and a liver and so on when you were forming in your mothers womb Variations in that code between individuals might cause some to grow up taller and some to grow up shorter You got half of your spiral sections theyre broken up into twenty three pairs of sections from your father and half from your mother which is why a pair of taller parents will tend to have taller kids

Now suppose that taller parents tend to have more kids than shorter parents Then the next generation will end up taller than the previous generation the variations in codes that tell bodies to construct taller bodies will be more common among the next generations inner spirals

Pile on one change after another after another after another that contributes to some couples having more kids than another Even though each change is a single alteration if you iterate that process thousands of times millions of times it can build whole complicated parts But it builds them without foresight without planning Every part of your body is made up of a cumulation of changes that started as copying errors in the tiny spirals theyre mistakes that happened to work Thats also where your mind design comes from from the copying errors and from some of those copying errors leading parents to have fewer kids and those errors dying out of the population and a few copying errors accidentally constructing people who had more kids and those variations spreading throughout the population If I was actually focusing on this topic properly Id sketch the design of an eyeball on the wall and show how it can develop in tiny changes starting from a single light sensitive spot on the forehead of some tiny crawling creature a hundred million years ago

For now the key thing to know going back to our actual current subject Validity is that your mind design accreted on the ability to think using and and the ability to think using or and the ability to think about stuff implying other stuff and the ability to imagine facts being true about all the objects inside a collection Its not all quite as redundant as it looks the human native ability to reason about or isnt quite the or that appears in very simple logic were more likely to say an object is red or blue meaning that its either one or the other but not both and less likely to say that this table is brown or not green considering that in fact it is both brown and not green We are in teaching ourselves to reason using the sharper simpler forms of logic repurposing bits of our mind away from their original contexts and stripping off real functionality along the way But thats part of the story of why we have such redundant facilities for thinking logically and and or and implies all at the same time

So would you like to guess now as to whether Im about to tell you about some new connectors that would let your mind expand to even more powerful ideas represent ideas that native human concepts cant represent at all

Is he going to do that That would be so cool

When I was a bit younger and learning this stuff for the first time I went straight to the Watcher the adult who was there to make sure the older kids werent teaching us anything too wrong and demanded that I immediately be taught the most powerful kind of logic there was The Watcher told me that the logic I was learning was the most powerful kind of logic on offer that it was in fact the most powerful kind of logic that could exist I didnt see how anyone could possibly know that even if it was true so I figured this was another of the lies they tell children or maybe that the best kind of logic was probably being kept secret by the Keepers Those being the people who would learn a more powerful kind of logic if it existed and was too dangerous for everybody to have I wanted that for myself so I tried inventing other kinds of logic with more powerful symbols in it symbols that could connect three or even four propositions together instead of just the one or two symbol connectors the older kids were telling me about

But before I tell you about the results of that particular journey of thinking and whether or not it did turn out to be a lie they tell children in the end let me pause and ask another question first In algebra we have rules for producing new equations from old equations or combining old equations Here we have rules for producing new statements from old statements if those statements are written in a particular language Both algebra and the statement rules obey the higher principle of Validity we have ways of comparing equations and statements to worlds to see if theyre true or false and if an equation or statement is true in a world the rules for manipulating it should produce only more true equations or true statements In the world of statements we managed to reduce or to and and not In the world of algebra we reduced the rule divide both sides by a nonzero quantity to multiply both sides by an inverse Can we in some way combine the rules of algebra and the rules of statements since they are both born of the same truth preserving principle Can we reduce algebra rules to statement rules or reduce statement rules to algebra rules and so simplify our mastery of truth perservation

This ones actually quite hard to solve from scratch at our intelligence level I didnt get it as a kid and wouldnt expect myself to get it now if I didnt already know it But it is important to know your own emptiness before trying to fill yourself so go and speak aloud any really bad wrong answers you come up with here

I mean you could write the rules of algebra in statement logic is that what you mean Like a b c if and then a bunch of stuff that correctly defines what plus is I dont know what stuff but I think thered be stuff Merixtell says

Show me your shot at it Ive been wrong once or twice guessing what you all cant do

Uh okay a plus b c if uh oh I think I actually only know what Id do if a and b and c were all whole numbers 

Ill take it

If theyre whole numbers theyre made of ones a plus b c if uh the process of taking ones from each side gets you zero on both She bites her lip but then you still have to define taking one I guess

Go ahead and define it then Dont worry too much about doing it wrong the first time this one is hard and Im impressed youre even trying Actually Im wondering if youve encountered something reflecting the correct answer from somewhere else in Golarion mathematics because if youre literally doing this part from absolute scratch its seriously impressive

She beams at him Minus one is 

 maybe you could do something with a contains one more thing than b if for every thing in b theres a thing in a and for every thing in a theres a thing in b plus one no now Ive just needed to invent plus maybe I can do that a is b plus no sorry I dont know 

If you dont know the right answer make up a wrong one Maybe youll be able to see why its wrong and correct it so long as you think it out loud And saying things out loud is a straightforward way to learn to think them out loud

I dont even know a wrong one

What is it exactly that you dont know again Try to tell me out loud what it is that you want to do and cant see any way to do

I want to say heres what it is to add one to something using just and and not and implies and for all And you can go for all numbers this number plus one equals something but I dont know how to say what the something is

Hint desired or undesired

What kind of fucking question is that

Maybe hes just very sadistic and this is all an elaborate game he is playing with them 

I think I might need one she says very lightly

If you take the hint now youll never know whether or not you needed a hint or just more time but were trying to industrialize a planet and thats probably more important than you ever knowing whether you could have punched above your measured intelligence level and discovered the deeper orders of Validity from scratch so yeah hint You cannot build add one out of only and not implies for all I previously showed you a system that had predicates like blue and red which took in the kind of object that forall quantifies over and spat out truth or falsehood depending on whether the object was red or not Theres no way to build add one out of only those materials because add one takes in an object a number and spits out another object

This doesnt mean your system has to start out knowing what add one means It does mean that youre going to have to conjure up an add one symbol that maps objects to objects and then start describing what it means But that description needs to talk about add one as a hypothetical function whose properties will be described not build it purely out of the predicate symbols and logical connectors You are also going to need a symbol for equality between two objects that one is usually assumed primitive that even if the system starts out knowing nothing else about the objects it describes it knows how to tell when two objects are equal takes in two objects and spits out truth or falsehood

Theres a more sophisticated trick you can pull to not need to introduce a special symbol for add one roughly you say for all functions from objects to objects if that function has these properties this stuff follows but that would involve quantifying over functions which we can skip for now So to reiterate You get to conjure the symbol for add one from nowhere you get to declare by fiat and premise that it takes in an object and spits out an object you dont however get to assume that it has any behaviors beyond that or means anything in particular except for whatever statements you make using the add one symbol Same for two object functions like add or multiply You can declare that theres a plus symbol and that it takes in two objects and spits out a third object but anything about which objects has to be described by you and thats what makes the symbols meaningful

Okay she says shakily I think I need time to think 

Anyone else want to try what she tried doing at all Trying something and failing is more impressive than not trying at all

Carissa is too busy worrying about whether things can be both true and heretical to pay this the amount of concentrated attention it clearly deserves but I think you want to start by saying what zero is and what one is Im not sure what that is mind I was thinking maybe zero is for all things not that thing but that doesnt seem quite right

Well indeed If it was the case that no object was zero there wouldnt be a number called that What does make zero special among the numbers If you have any ideas here say them informally first saying it formally is usually harder and its usually wiser to solve the easy problems before you tackle the hard ones

Well its what you get if you take a away from a for any a

Can you say that formally

I dont see how to until we have defined addition or subtraction which is the thing we were trying to do The thing Id say is k k 0 k but I dont think thats meaningful if I havent said what plus is yet

Remember how we managed to build or out of implies and not And that wasnt even set up on purpose by anyone or anything its just the human mind being thrown together by a design process that included more structure than the strict minimum Each time you say something like k k 0 k you constrain the meaning that and 0 can have Imagine looking at these blue circles each a possible world imagine that instead of colored shapes inside them there are objects that might be numbers a function that might be plus Every time you make another statement like k k 0 k you kick out some of the worlds and mappings where the function you mapped onto and the object you mapped onto 0 didnt always eat an object and 0 and spit that same object back out again Make enough statements like that and maybe you can narrow down the possible worlds to ones that only contain objects that look like the numbers you know That from a certain perspective is what it means to define numbers and arithmetic to find statements such that anything they are true about must be numbers and arithmetic Got any more statements like it Somebody wipe this wall please well want to start writing down the statements like forall k k plus 0 equals k

 oh She thinks of it before hes halfway done Zero is the only number where zero plus zero equals zero I said that poorly but 

By all means say it better then

0 0 0 k k 0 k k k

Progress But 0 isnt a thing in this language not takes in propositions which have the values of truth or falsehood and spits out falsehood or truth Not four isnt a number or if you wanted it to talk about the collection of all numbers except four wed have to start introducing collections and thats a big ol subject isnt already a symbol in our language either and in fact you dont particularly need to define a new symbol for it Next rewrite 

k k 0 k k k k k k 

She writes this rather than saying it because it seems like itd be quite unpleasant to say and harder to tweak while speaking She writes it with Prestidigitation because she has better control and precision than a student and they ought to remember it

Good try but your statement doesnt quite narrow down the possible worlds to where you wanted it includes worlds where k k k is true of every number including the one you called zero Can anyone see how to fix it

Cant you just add k0 to the second part

Works unless Ive missed something myself but do you want to write out exactly what you mean there to make sure its not just my own imagination supplying the answer I think is correct

k k 0 k k k k0 k k k 

He supposes its good that people are finding so many detailed ways to be wrong exhibiting them early and getting them out of the way

We havent said anything about adding outside the system up at our level rules for adding in parentheses that werent in the written formula So that could mean either of 

k k0 k k k k0 k k k
k k0 k k k k0 k k k

Second one the girl says

Then it looks good to me Keeping in mind that these dont exactly match standard forms I learned since were making them up as we go and my own intelligence is not at the level where I will reliably spot errors on the first pass Im not sure quite why I feel the need to say this it seems like the sort of thing that should be obvious but if Im the one who makes an error or it just looks like that speak up If youre right you get to be impressive and if youre wrong you need to know which mistake you made

Keltham keeps prodding the group for a while dropping hints as needed until hes pretty sure theyve written enough random rules to yield in their combination all the constraints of first order arithmetic except for the induction axiom schema If anybody from Cheliax brilliantly pulls the induction axiom schema out of their ass hes going to be sure theyre getting it from somewhere maybe dath ilani geniuses can pull that kind of shit at their age he doubts it but the geniuses of this world are only as smart as him unless theyre wearing intelligence headbands

They do not brilliantly pull the induction axiom schema out of their asses or out of his mind which they are not reading They do mostly manage to follow along through all the rules of first order arithmetic and they seem to be having fun about it

Once theyve got a nearly full set of rules Keltham remarks that the last puzzle piece for identifying the numbers as well as they can ever be identified in a certain sense hes not going into right now is one he really doesnt expect them to get unhinted

And then he drops on them the infinite axiom schema for induction trying as best he can to explain why youd need it to pinpoint the numbers

After clearing up any misapprehensions about that as best he can Keltham is ready to move on to his next point

Were running through things a lot faster than I went through them as a kid and Im probably accidentally leaving out important ideas along the way all of this would take more like a month if you were eight years old and doing the exercises even if you were doing nothing else But you may recall that some time earlier I posed some puzzles about asking for examples of necessary truths and why they were ever good for anything and what it means to say that one equals one is a necessary truth what you ought to expect to see happen as a result especially given that a necessary truth should still end up being true no matter what happens to you if it could happen inside any illusion depicted in full detail

We now have a language in which I can give some of my own answers there But before then does anybody want to take a renewed shot at saying what it is were talking about and what we should expect to see happen if we say that one equals one is a necessary truth

 that if its not true we just cant do any reasoning in a formal system at all

Does reality need to care what you cant reason about Perhaps you can depict an illusion in full detail in which one does not equal one and we will need to construct a new logic which does not take as primitive the assertion that every object equals itself in order to describe that illusion

 you cant depict an illusion in full detail in which one does not equal one

What about clouds drifting across the sky and sometimes separating One cloud equals two clouds it doesnt equal one cloud Divide both sides of the equation by cloud and there you have it

They stare concernedly at him

More to the point how would you depict one the successor of zero inside an illusion You can depict one cherry in a bowl of fruit in an illusion How would you depict one the successor of zero as it appears in our collections of statements

 youd just have to put the symbols

Then we have merely depicted the symbols talking about one in our illusion not depicted one itself Thats like making an illusion of a piece of paper with cherry written on it and saying you made an illusion of a cherry

Some particularly daring girls in the middle of the discussion of the induction axiom sent around a crumbled piece of paper as girls do it flew between desks as wizarding girls do its text was in Infernal as Chelish wizarding girls do It read is Keltham a sadist y n

The vote leaned yes

Kelthams audience squirms anxiously at this question

Keltham does not have the sharpness of unaided vision let alone interpretation capacity that would be required to perceive these nigh imperceptible squirms He lives in a mental universe very far away from this reality a mental universe where uncomfortable or unhappy students will of course speak up and tell you this fact as soon as they realize it themselves Though he has noticed his researchers apparent lack of any visible emotions besides competitive enthusiasm and is starting to wonder if they used a magical spell thats the equivalent of a mind affecting drug that made them fixedly enthusiastic

Well at least this time hes about to say some words where enthusiasm seems appropriate Keltham tries to channel the demeanor of an appropriately specialized Watcher as best he can the sort of Watcher who tries to make sure that kids get the full impact of things and arent cheated out of awesome stuff by older kids mistakenly trying to act like its no big deal

In my language wed say that the subject matter of our discussion when we talk about math is which conclusions follow from which premises When we discuss numbers and say 2 3 5 it implies that if we observe cherries and come to believe that our number axioms describe in reality the operations of combining bowls of cherries we will expect to see in reality that pouring a bowl of two cherries into a bowl of three cherries yields a bowl of five cherries If we get six cherries instead we might think we made a mistake in the math Or we might suspect that watching the bowl closely would let us see an extra cherry popping into existence In the latter case our beliefs about which conclusions validly follow from the addition premises would have been right but our guess that the addition premises applied to combining bowls of cherries would have been wrong Being the fragile creatures that we are and sometimes making mistakes in our reasoning when we do math about a bridge and then the bridge falls down we might be observing that the bridge disobeyed the premises about which we did math or we might be observing that we made an error about what was a necessary connection and our conclusion didnt follow even though all the premises were true

All of this is to say that we can observe the consequences the shadows of necessary truths when we watch the empirical world even to the point of our observations leading us to suspect errors in our own reasoning about what was necessary But observing the number 1 itself At best maybe somebody could make an illusion of an object representing zero not the successor of any other object connected by a successor relationship to the object that would therefore be one and Keltham draws some green dots connected by red arrows to other dots This would give us an illusion that would map very directly in our external interpretation onto a partial model that fits the number axioms But it doesnt make sense to say that the illusion is depicting the number one there isnt a single thingy like that out there floating in the void just a set of premises that actually existent things might obey in which case wed expect them to behave like the number one

The facts about which conclusions follow inevitably from which premises cant be said to be older than the temporal universe because theyre outside of time entirely its not that they existed before the universe began or that theyll last after the universe perishes but that they are somewhere above or below that Temporal and physical processes draw on necessities mirror them but cannot change them between one time and another Theres a certain sense in which in controlling our own decisions we are controlling links between premises and conclusions we are controlling given the premise of a person like ourselves the conclusion of which decision we come to but this doesnt mean we are changing mathematical facts between one time and another An alternate plane of existence or so I would suspect can obey different premises in its physical behavior it cannot alter which conclusions follow necessarily from which premises Those facts are not eternal but outside of time entirely This is one of the ideas invoked by a word in my language which translates into your word Lawful the concept of drawing on and mirroring the level of existence where certain facts may be viewed as absolute and unalterable

You have seen now how we can start with two apparently different concepts of validity one that preserves truths about properties of objects connected by and or implies one that produces true numerical equations from true equations and at least for the case of whole numbers reduced the equational subject matter to the predicate logic subject matter Just like we were able to reduce and to or or or to implies I will tell you now a point that you will not be ready to prove yourselves for a while the system of predicate logic Ive introduced to you is one of several systems that are complete in the sense that all mathematics can be translated into them The topology you learned as wizards unless it deals with some phenomenon absolutely foreign to dath ilan whose mere existence refutes this entire philosophy which I am mostly not expecting to be clear is just another kind of math that could be translated into this system or translated into several other systems I havent shown you all of which could also be translated into this system and into which this system could also translate moving between them as freely as we rewrite an implies connector as an or connector

This is one reason I could pop into another dimension and expect to have a reasonable conversation with Lrilatha who belongs to a species that doesnt exist in my world If different formulations of validity can so freely translate between each other it would seem more reasonable to hope that I to the extent I had those concepts right would use a version mappable to Lrilathas who is a Lawful being so that her arguments would make sense to me and my arguments make sense to her Either a conclusion follows with necessity from its premises or it does not Only mistakes about that subject matter could differ between people between factions between planes The right answer is the same everywhere And this is also part of the concept in my language which the translation spell translates into your word Lawful

It is probably optimistic to before she has even properly learned this herself conclude that Cheliax could be teaching it so much better but Cheliax could be teaching this so much better that it suddenly hurts to realize how badly she learned it before 

There is a right way to be Devils are it mortals arent Mortals were for a while at least controlled by gods who are but the control broke and now mortals just wander around missing the concepts that make up the right way to be for the most part not smart enough to learn them Cheliax emphasizes that this is disappointing to Asmodeus that it makes mortals less valuable to Asmodeus and of course thats the angle from which Asmodeus cares about it but the angle from which the humans ought to care about it is that they are worse It is in their interests to be perfected not because some god will get them when they die and the other gods waste even more of them but because there is a commonality among all perfect beings a shared language that the perfect can speak across planes across time 

How is it that Chelish children learn theyll be perfected and are scared instead of learning theyll be perfected and are joyful impatient full of the longing that filled Carissa when Contessa Lrilatha spoke why arent we teaching it like this but the answer of course must be that Asmodeus couldnt divine the result of thousands of years of experiments across an entire other world at least not more cheaply than He could grab someone from there 

Keltham pauses at least partially to catch his own mental breath He should probably call a break sometime soon but he was working around to a point some time earlier before the whole digression into Validity and first order arithmetic and he feels like it would be only polite to actually finish the digression and work around to what he meant to say before then Theres still some distance left to go before he can pop the stack he wasnt actually expecting on some wordless level that it would take this long to teach grown teenagers first order logic and how to axiomatize arithmetic

In saying all this Im jumping ahead in a dath ilani education and skipping over a number of exercises required to actually understand everything and a dozen dozen precautions we were given against common mistakes some of which now seem pretty silly and obvious to me but which might turn out to be a lot more necessary to otherwise unprepared minds I dont know

For example if somebody throws a ball and you need to catch it trying to translate your thoughts into predicate logic about the ball having the property of flying and this implying an eventual fall given gravity is going to utterly fail to help you You would be first of all better off thinking in your minds native wordless language that tries to visualize the balls fall and run to there because your native language is faster and the ball will fall before you can think of anything logical You would second of all be engaging in a particularly naive kind of jumping ahead of your real capabilities by trying to translate your thoughts about the ball directly into a logic with a falling predicate What you would actually need to predict the balls fall using serious math is calculus and not simple calculus either it would include terms like how the resistance of the air to the balls flight changed with the balls speed If you try to summarize all that by saying that the falling predicate on the ball was true when that falling statement would be equally true if gravity was pulling on the ball a different amount or if the air was more resistant youre throwing away details that actually matter in order to try to squeeze down the issue into predicate logic an amount of predicate logic that you find easy to handle which is too little to actually solve the problem You also wouldnt be absolutely certain about the balls position or trajectory and managing uncertainty inside of mathematics is a whole separate topic I havent broached to you

Actually solving the balls flight using a full written on paper account of how conclusions about whats probably true follow necessarily from some unnecessary premises you already believe about whats probably true would require setting up a complicated problem in calculus and probability that would describe how to infer the balls trajectory from what your eyes had seen of the ball And if you wanted that said in pure logic with all premises spelled out youd have to axiomatize that calculus problem into the more universal language of logic It is a whole lot easier to just run and catch the ball by thinking about it in your native brains native style

I mean maybe if you were a god you could solve the whole problem using explicitly valid reasoning or not Im not sure how mentally powerful your gods are exactly And if you were a god and you could do that then you could get tossed into another plane of existence where gravity works differently and rapidly recalculate how to catch flying balls from scratch and do that successfully on your first try instead of having to relearn the rules your brain uses through a lot of trying and failing But I am not a god yet and you are not gods also possibly yet and I doubt that any intelligence headbands we can afford in the foreseeable future will let us do it either

So dont get ahead of yourselves just because logic is absolute timeless and universal If you cant think fast enough to solve a problem using explicit logic or if it would require humanly unmanageable huge problem statements even in principle or if you simply dont know how then all that absolute and timeless stuff wont help you The fact there exists a better method that gods or super gods could use to solve a problem doesnt mean that you can solve it that way or that you can get closer to the super gods solution by using bad clownlike and tiny imitations of the outer forms of the ideal methods theyd use Gods seem like a surprisingly useful metaphor for ideal cognitive processes now that hes in a world that has gods Keltham is a little surprised it wasnt a more common explanatory metaphor used in dath ilan

I dont know if any of you actually needed me to say that to be clear But its the sort of thing they tell you when youre 8 years old and you get into your head the idea that if logic is so great you should be able to use it to crush your opponents at sportsball by making only sharply logical muscle movements I mean actually they just let me make the mistake and lose the sportsball game but then afterwards that was what they told me when I asked what Id been doing wrong and how to do it correctly

His audience nods seriously 

With that warning aside Ill try to give you more of the dire warnings I got as they come to mind and I remember what they were theres a final thought that runs deep in the dath ilani conception of Law which is why when I heard that Lawful was a godly concept rather than a human concept I immediately thought Heh I bet I know what thats talking about then and not Oh its probably something humans cant understand at all

If you start with a logical language that already has implies you can add on the new connector or and then though youve made the statements a little easier for humans to understand you havent made the language any more expressive your new innovation or turns out to be reducible to the same old implies combined with not After trying out a number of innovations of this type you might repeatedly find that you were unable to extend the real power of your language and so venture a guess a guess based on mere past experience like seeing that every triangle tested was a red triangle that you had reached some natural limit of logics power

But when I asked my Watchers as a child they did not tell me Were guessing this logical system is as good as it gets They told me This logic you are learning is the most powerful form of logic that can exist The Watchers where I come from are trained by Keepers and entrusted with the teaching of children they are not there to set a poor example by just making stuff up nor by taking great blatant invalid leaps nor by saying with certainty what they have no right to be certain of Its not something that gods told us either theres no gods where I come from remember So how did my Watchers know what could they possibly have known how could they possibly have obtained a piece of knowledge like that I do not expect you to guess this correctly I couldnt have done that without being told but Id like somebody to say out loud a wrong answer for its easier to fill yourself with knowledge after youve explicitly noticed yourself not being already full

An equivalence proof of some kind someone says after a moment That any kind of logic that does anything useful is the same as that one specifies the same things

It continues to be disorienting to Keltham each time his audience of empirical topologists throws around guesses built out of much more mathematically sophisticated language than you would associate with a dath ilani kid too young to know how p q was defined

Thats about the most plausible wrong guess I can imagine so congratulations on that But no They didnt tell me right away why they knew that time the Watchers left it mysterious so Id have some motivation to learn stuff myself And I apologize if Im correspondingly wrecking your own educations most optimal ideal form under ideal circumstances but we have a planet to industrialize so Im going to plow ahead anyways and just tell you maybe someday your kids will learn it the right way What my Watchers secretly knew was a completeness or idealness proof built from more powerful and sophisticated methods I wouldnt be ready to use myself until late in age 12 They defined the most you could possibly reasonably ask for out of a logic then proved they already had that

Consider again our worlds of blue circles containing red triangles and green squares and objects related by successorship and multiplication and all the rest We have said that the subject matter of logic is necessary connections from premises to conclusions Then the perfect or ideal logic would be one which given some collection of premises could derive through its permitted steps of inference every possible conclusion which actually followed from those premises

Well with some fairly high powered techniques you can prove that first order logic does in fact have this property which means that if you created a new logic which is a single sentence more productive in the sense that it says even one more thing follows from a premise set which the logic I showed you cannot derive through its allowed steps that new logic is making non truth preserving leaps there will be some model some world where all the premises are true but that extra derived conclusion is false

The key to that proof incidentally I sort of feel like I ought to say this both to give you some hope that such a proof actually exists and to make reconstructing all this reasoning easier if it turns out that the food here is poisonous to me after all and it gets too expensive to keep resurrecting me is a compactness proof Oh nice you have a word for that so Im guessing you used a similar concept in topology The compactness proof shows that if an infinite set of logical statements has no semantic model if there is no depictable world or illusion in which all the premises are true then some finite subset of those statements has no model We further prove that if a finite collection of statements has no semantic model we can syntactically prove a contradiction from those statements in a finite number of steps Then if Q follows from a collection of premises in every possible model of those premises we can adjoin Q as an additional premise to the collection yielding a collection of premises which has no models and obtain a contradiction in finitely many syntactic steps and from this by double negation we can syntactically prove Q in finitely many steps So whenever Q follows from a collection of premises we can prove it from those premises syntactically

Thats the final reason I expected Lrilatha and myself to reason in ways that were not quite so different even though she wasnt human and possibly hung out with gods Assuming the whole dath ilani philosophy was true across all planes though I wasnt quite certain of that and Im still not it wouldnt be surprising if Lrilatha could see some conclusions following from premises faster than I could But it would be surprising considering the proof that logic is literally as good as it possibly gets and gives us everything we could possibly want if Lrilatha could make premise conclusion leaps of a qualitatively different kind that I could not follow even in principle using new rules of deduction and permissible derivation that no dath ilani had ever encountered

That said if you introduce the ability to directly quantify over functions or predicates the proof I described no longer works but most philosophers of mathematics in dath ilan claim that this cant really be improving the power of the logic because anything you can actually derive in the syntax of a second order logic that quantifies over functions can also be derived inside some corresponding first order system that doesnt like this one doesnt I mention it because Im now in some totally other plane and ought properly to be less sure of some things than I was yesterday and if Asmodeus does show up using genuinely valid reasoning I cant follow even in principle thered be an obvious immediate guess that he was taking advantage of physical principles that dont exist in my universe but let him directly access the semantics of quantifications over predicates We were pretty sure that was physically impossible inside our own universe but this plane might or might not be another story But again I am mostly not expecting that to be the case and if Lrilatha could do that she politely didnt do it around me

Thats the final piece of the concept that Lawful translates into my language the ability of human beings even if its only a little even if they have to struggle and work hard at it and often its just faster to run and catch the ball instead of overthinking it to sometimes know and make a more deliberate use of Laws that are timeless universal and even sometimes knowably optimal

And thats why I heard that Lawful was a god concept and thought to myself Heh I bet I know where thats pointing to on at least some things There are in at least some parts of the Law a single best way you can possibly do it and then you cant do any better than that There may be more aspects to god thought that I cant understand at all for all that I presently know But if Validity is a part of the god concept of Lawfulness at all then I can take a pretty good guess at which version of Validity the gods are using which rules they use to decide which arguments follow from which arguments Namely any one thats inside the huge equivalence class of possible rules that allow deriving all the consequences of the premises you have but not deriving any more than that

To be clear I just popped into another dimension I am guessing at some things rather quickly I could be very wrong about all of this and any more Lawful beings around are welcome to show up and tell me so before I mislead the lot of you any further I do think I have enough dignity not to take offense at being told I made some wrong guesses within my first two days of materializing in another world

But it is the obvious thing to suspect when somebody tells you that Lawfulness is a god concept One at once suspects that the gods and smarter Lawful beings will be using forms of the Law that are optimal within certain dimensions in some cases where I already know which kind of optimality to look for and that it isnt a very impossible kind of optimality to have if your brain isnt as completely messy as a human one

It seems likely that Asmodeus is doing something that this isnt Both because it seems heretical to say He isnt and because theres a discontinuity right its not that entities get more powerful and then some of them are debatably gods and then some are more unambiguously gods either youre a god or you arent and it feels intuitively right that that would be because gods have access to an entire form of valid reasoning mortals dont

She is uncomfortably aware that none of those previous steps were valid reasoning She thinks maybe she needs some practice at compartmentalizing so she can do well in logic class and not be aware of the validity of her reasoning all the time while shes trying to catch flying balls Keltham specifically warned you shouldnt try using logic for that sort of thing

And remember again its not that humans contain nothing of Validity You have concepts like or and and You have in fact more concepts than you need in order to make first order logic complete and some of them are redundant The human problem is not so much what we can never manage to derive in infinite time as that we are too slow and even more than that we tend to derive an awful lot of stuff that doesnt follow In dath ilan the Very Serious People used to complain a lot about how we were all being terrible at this and I used to think of myself as being willing to pursue even riskier and wilder lines of reasoning than that but now that Ive read a book in Cheliax it really puts a lot of that into perspective

But I digress Humans contain shards pieces of the higher mathematical structure we call Validity the content of necessity the rules governing premises and conclusions whose optimal answer is pinpointed by the completeness theorem Without these shards of Law humans couldnt function at all These shards of Law within us are not manifested in a centralized single engine whose voice we sometimes ignore rather there are bits and pieces and shadows and correlates of Validity glommed onto us by mistakes retained in the tiny spirals specifying the starting biology of our brains Its not that theres a perfect engine of Validity inside us thats corrupted Its not even that the parts of the perfect engine are distributed here and there inside us The human versions of logical concepts like our version of or often implying exclusive orness which isnt the logical version I showed you but sometimes not being exclusive either are more like weird shadows or correlates of pieces of Law Same goes for the human native version of Z implies Q In the human version it feels stranger to say that if Im naked that implies Im wearing a shirt is extremely true about me because Im not naked and I am wearing a shirt You can make logic out of the human pieces

But for all that the human pieces were sloppily thrown together its no coincidence that you can make a valid logic out of them Generation after generation for millions of years there were slight advantages in reproduction to the ancestors of humanity who we call hominids when they could do a better job of deducing unseen truths from the truths they already knew or guessed The human versions of and and or and implies were built into us in order to do jobs including that job And because there is only a single complete structure of Validity in the realm of math because there is a Law and a best Law and its not that hard a Law to find all the bits and pieces of Validity that made their way into us could have enough coherence and overlap in their messiness that a shadow of true Law could be born inside them

Validity is not the only principle with messy shards embedded into humans in whose overlap and coherence the shadow of higher Law can be seen Another such principle is the one my people name Expected Utility singled out as a unique answer by what we call coherence theorems If yesterday you trade two apples for twenty cherries and then tomorrow you trade twenty cherries for one apple youve gone around in a circle and ended up with fewer resources than you had when you started This is the bare start of a gesture in the direction of proofs that say If you do a lot of deals with apples and cherries in ways that inconsistently value them relative to each other youll end up with strictly fewer of both apples and cherries than you couldve had by doing different deals If Im rolling a die that must show either an even or an odd number youd be foolish to buy for eight silver pieces a gambling ticket that pays seven silver pieces if the die shows an odd number and six silver pieces if the die shows an even number This is the bare start of a gesture at the proof that when you weight the probability of paths through time inside your mind you should not weight a sub possibility of a path more highly than you weight its whole

The principle of Expected Utility has indeed a sub principle which we call Probability with rules and coherences of its own You may have noticed that a great number of conclusions that we need in everyday life do not follow with necessity from any facts that we are highly confident about but there are also proofs about the best guesses you can extract from a state of uncertainty and how you cannot do better than those without adding more data or more certainty into your premises

Validity Probability Utility Things being more or less likely encountering new evidence and revising old beliefs deriving the consequences of what we already know wanting things making plans Its not so much that humans have bits and pieces of the Laws glommed onto us as that the shadow of those Laws within us explains in a certain sense why we function at all why we can do even the little that we can do One of my pending questions about Golarion is whether Chaotic gods are still like mostly Lawful on a deep level and are just pursuing surface goals that are about humans behaving chaotically in social situations or something like that because otherwise I have a hard time imagining what it means to be a god or intelligent if your nature is contradictory to all Law The partial coherence that exists in the noisy bits of Law embedded in us creating somewhat larger shadows of bigger pieces of Law is what lets us form larger thoughts that make enough sense for us to ever figure out anything That all these bits and pieces of Law are bits and pieces of this larger coherent thing is part of the story behind how we can put together the human versions of or and implies and make larger useful thoughts out of them If Chaotic gods dont have that much Law embedded inside them if they reject every bit and shard of Validity because its Lawful and therefore never think I guess that either Z or H will happen I cant begin to imagine how a Chaotic god would work Which is one of the reasons why I wonder whether the concept Lawful is translating correctly for me after all

But thats me being confused about this world which is not our present priority

Our present priority is the industrialization of Golarion

And the reason I say all of this to you is to make a certain point about our most important tool for doing that

Our path will be relatively simpler easier more direct though still not easy if a lot of the particular hidden orders I remember about dath ilani steel and dath ilani biology are also true here albeit with some new hidden orders about magic that were not in dath ilan

But if that isnt true If snowflakes have six sides here for other reasons If my body was remade anew in Golarion so that I could eat the food

Then the valuable knowledge I have to teach you will be the knowledge of how to discover hidden orders And this knowledge in dath ilan is said to be attained by using and operating shadows of Law that are purer cleaner more complete than humans just throwing themselves at a problem with their own instincts The explicit math is mostly reified Probability but the internal mental challenges are mostly those of being a little more Valid in which conclusions we jump to and which assumptions we mark as necessary

I am a lot more confident that Validity Probability and Utility are still singled out mathematical structures whose fragmented shards and overlapping shadows hold power in Golarion than I am confident that I already know why snowflakes here have sixfold symmetry And I wanted to make that clear before I said too much about the hidden orders of reality out of dath ilan that even if the things I am saying are entirely wrong about Golarion that kind of specific knowledge is not the most important knowledge I have to teach I have gone into this little digression about Validity and timelessness and optimality in order to give you some specific reason to think that even if the stranger proves to have no idea how Golarion is ordered some of the knowledge he has to teach is sufficiently general that you have strong reason for strong hope that it will work in Golarion nonetheless

My memory is not perfect and I was never a specialist in metal and fire To industrialize Golarion what we must primarily use is not the recipes of dath ilan and its knowledge of hidden orders for those I do not all have with me even if they would work here What we need to do is operate the principles of thought and investigation by which dath ilan found the hidden orders and recipes that worked in dath ilan and with those interplanar shards of Law find the hidden orders and recipes that work in Golarion If I can accurately remember some of the recipes and hidden orders from dath ilan and they prove to carry over here I expect that will give a rather substantial boost compared to starting from scratch But I also expect that it cannot carry the day unless we do a little or rather a lot of saner thinking of our own

It is said also in dath ilan that there is a final great principle of Law less beautiful in its mathematics than the first three but also quite important in practice it goes by the name Coordination and deals with agents simultaneously acting in such fashion to all get more of what they wanted than if they acted separately Here too I considered myself relatively wild in this regard compared to dath ilani standard but that was before I came to Golarion and read about what all yall were getting up to around here I expect I will have something to say on Coordination too at some point or another

Ill pause here so we can all take a break for meals and washrooms and resume in four third hours in one and a third hours Though I can also stick around here for another two dozen half minutes twelve minutes if anyone wants to ask any immediate questions that you dont want to let fall out of your memory I mean you can write them down but I appreciate that there can be important messy thoughts that are hard to write down full notes to yourself about and if so I can manage to stick around twelve minutes while you blurt them out before you forget them

Meritxell wants to know what makes people able to become Keepers while theyre still alive Are they the smartest people The most careful Can you tell at age ten

Not the question Keltham was expecting but Okay Fine

Id guess the smartest the most careful we have a specialized term for that as a usually mostly stable quality of a person maybe conscientiousness would be the best translation here I expect theyd look for things you can test in childhood that somebody has shown to correlate with keeping oaths in adulthood later and being very unlikely to go unstable under stress I mean the real answer to your question is that we have prediction markets people betting on outcomes with which a lot of people betting operates as a kind of summary of everyones best guess at the probabilities of definite observations being made later And I would strongly expect the Keepers have secret prediction markets that only Keeper institutions can bet on because its a secret what exactly theyre betting on because they dont want parents pushing their kids into faking their way into joining the Keepers But I imagine the secret prediction market topics say is this person going to end up passing the following competence tests will they end up measurably mastering the Way that Keepers keep will it be recorded that any spilled secrets get traced back to them will they ever be observed to have broken an oath they took Are they going to get along with other Keepers the right amount neither too conforming nor too iconoclastic Will they end up being promoted are they going to report enjoying their work and be happy at it in observable ways now that I say it out loud I feel like theres probably more in the secret markets than that Thats the kind of market you run to find out if a kid is going to be a good matchmaker or doctor not to find out who ought to be a Keeper The thing is prediction markets are ultimately betting markets and they have to resolve in definite observations at some point So theres some sort of observable thing that would happen to you over the course of your career as a Keeper that a bet would have to be about in order for it to ever pay out In terms of your local system I dont quite know if theyd qualify as Good they do get paid for what they do in both money and reputation but they definitely lean further Good than average they are in the end spending their lives taking care of other people

Ive always felt weird about the aspect where Keepers are significantly more Good than I am to be frank Even if you nod respectfully at them and pay a tiny fraction of their salaries theyre still doing you this huge favor that you didnt ask for some of which probably has to be done in order to make society livable for you at all but theyre doing more of it than Id ask for if it was up to me supposedly on my behalf And they arent doing it wrong that I know about or hurting me in any way that I know about But theyre still doing more of what they do than Id have really asked for though Im not a typical dath ilani the typical dath ilani probably feels more on median average like theres the right amount of Keepering going on Though actually by the nature of their jobs theres got to be more of it going on than we really know a specific reason for So some reasons for the Keepers existences are hidden and maybe my own first impression feelings are closer to average and Im just failing to adjust for predictable updates on the hidden info if I could see it the whole Keeper thing is probably one of the objectively weirder institutions in dath ilan from an outside viewpoint along with the Surreptitious Head Removers the Official Government Con Artists and the Planetary Emergency Rehearsal Festivals All of which have completely logical and reasonable reasons behind them and are still understood and acknowledged even by Civilization generally to be some of the weirder things they have talked themselves into doing

Though I mean I dont disagree with the reasons I can see why something like the Keepers need to exist Very stable geniuses can extensively develop thoughts that will wreck less stable peoples minds often without them even meaning to do that Even pursuing Lawfulness too far can sometimes end up that way Human beings are not designed to work great when we push ourselves harder and harder in the direction of Lawfulness I mean were not designed at all but I doubt its something our distant ancestors bred themselves to be able to do safely I imagine that Keepers are people who by nature are smart and resilient and exceptionally stable in the face of internal insult able to tolerate weird stuff going on inside or outside their own heads and what they spend that internal resilience on is going way further in the direction of Law than their ancestors a million years earlier were pseudo designed to do

And I mean Im sure the Keepers have got a pretty good idea about who can do that by age ten But thats not because I could take one glance at a ten year old and figure out whod be a good Keeper Its because I confidently predict the Keepers observe a lot of facts about ten year olds and they keep excellent records of long term outcomes and they train people with very high measured intelligence to make good predictions about it Come to think I wouldnt be surprised if the Keepers had a secret prediction market about me somewhere in their systems saying exactly what my chances were of succeeding at my life goals and people like me arent told those predictions because thats exactly the kind of information that can be a bit more Lawfulness than were really happy having in our lives And if you can predict that actually a kid is going to be totally okay with knowing that information then maybe you try to make them a Keeper Or maybe what they predict isnt so much kids starting out imperturbable as that youll end up driven to face down whatever kind of internal bumps you face in order to be able to face any kind of disturbing truth and not allow your potential to be limited by the disorder of your own mind I dont know I didnt want to be a Keeper They werent the kind of weird I wanted to be

She nods And if smartness is part of it then probably our world just doesnt have people smart enough to be Keepers yet

I genuinely couldnt guess how much you need Keepers and if maybe you should slap some intelligence headbands on your top geniuses and have them do their best with whatever Law they can reconstruct from what I remember Maybe your society does really badly without that and does better with some Keepers that are the best Keepers you can make Dath ilan bred itself for intelligence over time they didnt always have people as smart as the smartest people now and there must also have been a time when the Keepers had much less knowledge of Law and had just started out being Keepers Or maybe you can get by on having a couple of advisors like Lrilatha or building some kind of interplanar communicator that you can use to talk to axiomites Lrilatha called them though she didnt think they could live here and Im not sure if they could do the things that a Keeper could do Look I think this question is in an important sense premature Lets get some Chelish geniuses thinking and talking in terms that dont sound like total nonsense first and if anybodys really good at it maybe theyll start up the Keepers here

The girls are so ready to get back to work on that

It seems odd to think that the Keepers would be motivated by Good by wanting to help people It seems like you could run something like that off the pure selfish want to be more perfect more like a god held to the standards of gods surely thats a drive in most people strong enough to matter far far more than the question of whether being like that benefits other people

Keltham admires and is quietly starting to feel a bit concerned about their apparently infinite well of drive and enthusiasm but he needs to eat lunch and frankly allow his brain to cool down a step before resuming the Golarion Industrialization Project Hes not going to stop them from talking about it with each other but he needs to not talk about that during lunch and would like something like ten minutes to himself before he talks about anything at all

Irori has not been spending nearly enough energy to decode the actual words being exchanged on the material plane but He has continued looking in this direction whose spiritual position and velocity is looking increasingly relevant to His interests

Would you look at that somebody from this benighted corner of reality is thinking in a surprisingly non clueless direction about what it even means to be a god that isnt about touching that damnable Starstone

Why this quite interesting event is happening inside Cheliax is not something Irori can deduce from the information he has but He should perhaps do a little about it 

Irori sends a brief information packet to Asmodeus requesting conversation under certain terms and conditions

Asmodeus does not get a lot of requests from other gods that he commit to non intervention on the information They would like to bring to His attention for a negotiation If it happens twice in 28800 time units then there is a single underlying cause

Asmodeus suspects He may already know what Irori is asking about He does not disclose this

He agrees to the conversation

Irori sends a potential contract to Asmodeus regarding the treatment of a certain mortal identity to be revealed after contract is signed

A current mortal inhabitant of Cheliax seems to have set one foot upon the Way

This mortal is not to be particularly hindered by Asmodeus or His deliberately dispatched agents

If the mortal continues upon the Way their steps shall no doubt take them beyond Cheliax in due time No devil shall accept sale of their soul as Cheliax sometimes demands of its people before allowing them to leave Should such an event occur in Cheliaxs due civil processes any such devil is to instruct Cheliax that this mortals soul may not be bought but that the mortal is to be allowed to leave Cheliax regardless and not hindered in going where their footsteps take them

The mortals current teachers shall not be killed by Asmodeus or His dispatched agents for a period of at least one year If Asmodeus wants to wipe out their teachers after that Irori shall not interfere His Way is not a Way of rendering a mortals path easy and such events have not uncommonly spurred others on their Way

For this boon Irori offers a relatively small amount of energy in payment the request doesnt call on Asmodeus to make any urgent costly revelations If the mortal falls before Cheliaxs ordinary challenges then so be it Indeed Irori is offering an energy payment barely more than the cost to Asmodeus to thus instruct His relevant soul buying devils to refuse a certain contract Irori would offer a greater fraction of the gains from trade if not for Asmodeuss barely Lawful tendency to selectively accept contracts on which He can screw others over a tendency which Irori needs to take into account when offering prices

That squirrel Everybody sure does love that squirrel 

It is a cheaper ask than Abadars and in fact wholly encompassed by it already Hes already not allowed to keep that squirrels soul Which Irori does not know because this is the fun kind of negotiation that isnt occurring with mutual access to all relevant information

He observes that Cheliax has departing persons sell their soul for reasons mainly that it keeps them from endangering Cheliax in ways that require costly intervention and that the cost to Him of a troublemaker running around exceed in expectation the cost of informing His devils not to take the contract And that the sort of soul that might find Iroris Way is an unusually valuable one to Him too The price isnt high enough 

Irori would probably abandon the negotiation at this point if the squirrel were only a normal amount of promising but Asmodeus has the secret information that this is in fact an EXCEPTIONALLY BIZARRE squirrel and so He predicts Irori is actually willing to pay more 

Irori will go as high as the expected cost to a god of a mortal troublemaker as well as the expected cost of informing His devils in due time plus a bare margin of profit to make the contract beneficial to Asmodeus at all Asmodeus will wantonly wreck this soul for no good reason in the afterlife if Asmodeus gets it so Irori does not accept that argument

It would be a higher price but Irori needs to take into account that Asmodeus is much more likely to accept this contract if it is in some way cheaper to Asmodeus or less beneficial to Irori than expected That is as high as Irori is willing to go if Asmodeus wants different prices He needs to become a different kind of being Irori would be overjoyed to explain the relevant changes if Asmodeus is interested in correcting His flaws

Deal Pleasure doing business What squirrel

Irori transmits the identifying info for one Carissa Sevar and goes about His Way

Seriously That one 

So what kind of group lunch facilities do they have around here

The grand dining hall has a spread of various foods it is very abundant by Golarion standards The girls are mostly eating and sometimes speaking quietly to each other

It is not traditional at Chelish schools to talk much about your classes After all your classmates are your competitors not your friends sometimes it is mutually beneficial to collaborate on some problems because two people are smarter than one but itd be stupid and pathetic to try to build friendships out of that 

These classes are hard not to talk about though They are compromising by talking about their teacher This constrains them to things its fine if he overhears or to speaking Infernal which he might think is odd some of them have bland conversations with innuendo that should be hard for him to catch and some go for Infernal and wait to see if theyll get slapped for it 

Conversations physically more distant from Keltham get steadily more interesting

I think it must be taught very differently in Hell because most people couldnt learn this way at all

I think Hell is doing something different shaping the way your intuition brain works instead of teaching you how to override it with formal precision there are devils that dont have high intelligence and they still have it 

And shaping the intuitions requires suffering because its the language our subconscious speaks But teaching how to override it with formal precision doesnt necessarily 

Were still going to have to get the intuitions later though

Keltham quietly eats his food for at least the first ten minutes Insofar as his brain isnt just plain resting its going back through what he said to check whether he said anything spectacularly stupid

He notes absently some Chelish girls having conversations in a language he doesnt speak It doesnt seem particularly worrisome by comparison with people in Chelish Governance wearing intelligence headbands having conversations where Keltham cant see them at all His research harem is probably just discussing strategies for seducing him or something

 should he briefly rapidly cover genetics and deliberate heritage optimization next Its got a long time lag before its useful but that might be all the more reason for Cheliax to get started on it early

She gives him the ten minutes he asked for eleven to be safe and then sits down across from him which no one else has quite dared to do Is the connecting all the lessons to the fundamental structure of the universe a dath ilani thing or a you thing

Dath ilani they do a lot of stuff there and I am wildly guessing which parts are most important No thats vastly overstating my competence Im flailing around going through stuff as it seems relevant to something that comes up You know what I totally forgot to do that whole time I forgot to make occasional deliberate mistakes so that people would pay attention to what I wrote and compete to find the errors first

Awww thats so mean to them but its probably a great idea

Mean to them I mean I suppose it is easier on them per half second if you dont do anything that requires them to pay close attention but if they dont want to expend effort to learn why arent they just goofing off somewhere instead Mean would be making them expend more effort per unit of learning and the fact that dath ilan does this suggests that at least in dath ilan its been measured to net improve learning per unit of time or effort Unless thats different here I think I wouldve been bored if the older kids and Watchers teaching me werent making occasional errors and I wasnt competing to find them

Theres a case for concealing this but she doesnt buy it somehow You can only lean on acting ability so far and if hes going to fix pedagogy in Cheliax he has to know some things about whats wrong with it

In the school I went to youd have gotten in trouble if you called out the teacher for an error and were wrong for being disrespectful and wasting their time and interrupting the lesson so itd be scary to point out a mistake not being sure if its a trick youre meant to call out or your mistake youre admitting I would definitely expect it to be an effective teaching tool Effective teaching often involves putting people in situations that they feel scared of so they notice its fine

But it sounds like even you could see the problem with that Im a little puzzled about how a Lawful country as a whole ends up doing something where it sounds like a prediction market would straightforwardly predict that you could do it differently and get better results Like by putting in deliberate errors so that students would have to take the scary step of potentially exposing that they got their own understanding wrong and let the teacher actually know that and be able to correct it If even you could see that as a kid the people running the school should be able to see it or at least see the possibility And experiment with a changed policy so if it worked they could adopt it more generally do better on their metrics and pick up whatever performance bonuses theyd get for that Or did you only notice there was a better way after you noticed me acting differently and then it clicked for you

I noticed just now The prevailing philosophy of education is that it is more efficient if the best students arent held back by the worst ones and that means students shouldnt interrupt much or ask questions since itll be disproportionately the stupid ones doing that and wasting the time of the smarter ones So introducing deliberate errors and overall encouraging more discussion of errors isnt obviously wise its obvious effect would be more errors and its thought that the cost of that in holding back the best students is higher than its benefits

It seems like an obvious answer would be to sort your kids by their current progress in the class cross talent so everybody in the room was in roughly the same place going at roughly the same speed its been a while and I was a kid then and I obviously never had my own kids so Im not sure But I dont remember a sense that anyone in particular was holding others back or being held back and I do remember that wed learn different things in different groups My guess is youre going to say the student population is divided by region since travel is more expensive and the regional population is too small for sorting

We sort by ability as far as we possibly can we know its important but it might be a lot less than you need to sort in order to not have this problem Ive heard of kids who have to walk eight miles to school but not more than that I think past that point there are diminishing returns because theyre tired and cant learn as well Do you send people farther than that

Walk eight miles crap on a stick Yeah kids in an especially low density area might travel eight miles to school Which would take them roughly a dozen half roughly six minutes by self driving ultraspeed carriage If you live in a real city like my parents did eight miles would Im losing track of the conversions in my head and need scratch paper Eight miles or six minutes would take you from the outer edge to the center of a city with around ten to the seventh around ten million people in it

Theres around twenty million people in all of Cheliax and were eight hundred miles from the western to the eastern edge And were more densely populated than most places

Lets optimistically call that plenty of room to expand All we need is to hold back the Worldwound for one more generation while yall learn how to farm more efficiently and then couples can have six kids on average and throw three times as much resources at the Worldwound in twenty years Well call that Plan 2 and see if theres any faster methods for Plan 1

 people do have six kids just they usually lose half of em but I think the argument still holds just youll have to teach us what your society does for illness as well as famine

Yeah Keltham feels an unfamiliar twinge suggesting to him that information here should be given away for free even though its not part of fundamental universals He tells that twinge to go away Cheliax should be happy enough to pay for valuable info like that

 non Chelish factions are a thing

Maybe this information should be given away after all

 Chaotic factions are a thing What if the info about curing childhood illness is easier for Chaotic countries to master than improved agriculture

Sometimes Keltham wishes he was someplace that was Not Golarion He looks down at his food Am I guessing implausibly when I imagine that a local Very Serious Person like Lrilatha would tell me to make certain that any information which spreads about curing childhood diseases must be harder to use than information about growing more food because if the reverse is true Chaotic countries will grow twice as many kids as they can feed and then try to storm the Lawful countries and take all their food to feed them

 I wouldnt actually expect them to do that because it still requires coordinating if youre spreading the information about how to prevent pregnancies youd need to get all the parents to have far too many children for the national good and thats exactly what Chaotic countries are no good at there are a bunch of places that dont do agriculture at all just piracy and raids on civilized people but I dont know how to think about how theyd be affected by there being less illness Illness is contagious probably whatever youve got for that itll just be better to tell everyone in the world But I havent studied international relations

The Chaotic countries wouldnt have to plan it Theyd just need to have six kids the way people here usually do and then half of the kids dont die because that part was easier than growing twice as much food

And then theyre more populous than us yeah I guess that could happen I would expect Asmodeus to intervene in a dynamic where Chaos is triumphing over Law by virtue of being more willing to have kids they cant feed but its better not to count on that when thinking about policy Why is the crops part harder than the illness part

Because you need many ordinary people with incredibly low intelligence to do correct complicated things to their own farms for half a year instead of a few above average people who are slightly less stupid to be doctors and do correct complicated things to kids I guess I wouldnt be shocked if Chaotic countries just cant do either He still needs to check with somebody like Lrilatha before he starts spilling specific info about this topic to someone like Carissa or so Keltham suspects a more Serious person than him would tell him to do

I think probably what youd get is good doctors in cities and not out in the countryside where most people live Cheliax can get good doctors out to the farmers but were richer than most places and trying harder most rulers dont actually care how many baby peasants die I dont think

Is the whole thing with rulers something that can be quickly explained to you know never mind I think this general topic trend is tiring out my brain again and I should be letting it recover faster What do people in Cheliax do for fun if thats not too broad a question

In Corentyn where Im from they go swimming at the beach or anyone with a bit of wizardry climbs the cliffs and then jumps off using magic to safely land Some people train and race horses or hunting dogs or falcons People go out drinking People go to public executions Shes going to elide that one People fight bulls or watch other people fight bulls Theres theatre

How much wizardry does the cliff jumping take because that I have not tried before Also go out drinking what

Its a first circle spell Feather Fall Theres a special technique that lets you tie it off even closer to complete than most spells so you can activate it just by clenching your fist its recommended to do it over the water though so if you manage to fuck up at clenching your fist you just get a very unpleasant splash landing

Yeah noted Drinking

Consuming alcohol in order to get drunk which is an altered state of consciousness where you are gigglier and more reckless and like people better though the effects vary a lot by person Often accompanied by hooking up with people which is having sex with them

Huh We use mind affecting drugs mainly to teach young adults how to go on thinking well when their brain gets mildly challenged how to notice specific impairments and work around them or back off and not try to do things their brain isnt working well enough to do I dont think Ive heard of a drug that makes people like each other better and enjoy sex more though it wouldnt surprise me if you could get it in a Shop of Ill Advised Consumer Goods Dare I inquire what procedure a Lawful sensible country like Cheliax must have used to test the long term effects of this drug on people both physiological and psychological before approving that drug for unwarned general purchase

 I mean mostly Asmodeus would tell us if we should be doing something else I guess without that itd be really hard to know

If I were Asmodeus Id tell you how to set up prediction markets for that sort of thing instead of you having to bug him all the time is Asmodeus just a sufficiently strange being that he cant easily calculate what bits of simple advice could make humans be more competent and less weird

Lately I have been assuming that giving us that advice would be more expensive than uh summoning or copying you from your universe But setting that aside it seems rather likely that you might need smarter people than we have or more production surplus to be able to have them surpass just having experts study an issue and come up with a recommendation to the Queen And that while weve only got a limited number of smart people youd want them on something else Also the gods have less information than mortals about most things happening on this plane but theyve specifically got really good information on all the souls that made it to their afterlife so its easy for Asmodeus to answer questions on anything thats been around long enough that lots of people in Hell experienced it while living And alcohol has been around thousands of years So Id expect Asmodeus has at least checked whether drinking it more or less makes you more or less Lawful and smarter or stupider and more or less able to adapt in Hell

Yeah I think I see Maybe prediction markets assume lots of people who can make predictions and you need to know what to think of all their different opinions collectively not that youre struggling to get even a single person to predict anything Which is a problem that dath ilan also solves by starting a prediction market to be clear but maybe thats based on the assumption that if you subsidize the bets a hundred people will immediately show up and bet

What does happen in Hell exactly 

Oh boy 

You turn into a devil gradually one as cool as Lrilatha if you are very dedicated and smart and willing to work at it people get sorted and the exact process and kind of devil depends a lot on what suits you and whats achievable with you as a starting point I think it doesnt involve any logic lessons in the median case which is sort of confusing but my guess is that the median person isnt smart enough to learn that way A lot of it based on what you said I would say its aimed at changing how human instincts and intuitive processes work to be more Lawful instead of teaching it explicitly My great grandfather complains about it but my great grandfather complains about everything It is pretty common for people to say that it hurts at various points like seeing something very very bright when youve only ever seen dim things or stretching your legs when youve been sitting on them for a thousand years It is not at all common for people to say that they regret it or want to stop halfway through

I get the impression that becoming a god happens to rather fewer people but do you know how that compares

Four peopleve become gods with the Starstone none of them described it usefully rather than poetically I think its instantaneous instead of taking centuries so thats a pretty big improvement all by itself Id definitely go for godhood preferentially if I thought I could swing it Lrilathas really cool but probably Asmodeus is so much cooler

Im not at all sure Id take instantaneous over gradual even if something ended up more powerful at the end of the instant Theres not much point if the thing that becomes the god gets changed so fast that theres no continuity with the old you Are there non Starstone gods

Irori reportedly ascended by achieving mental and physical perfection which is definitely gradual I think his holy books probably have a fair bit of detail but I dont remember it Because theyre illegal for her to read Hes big in Vudra across the continent from here but my mother was always fond of him she said he was a good god to have in mind for having high standards for yourself Presumably someone can get you a book if you ask

Huh Not sure if Id go that route but its not an instant no Whats different in other afterlives besides Hell

Abaddons the one that eats souls The Abyss is infinite and the one the demons at the Worldwound come from and reportedly you start out there as a sort of grubbish larval demon and if no one kills you first mature into a demon eventually The Maelstrom is full of energy and magic but nothing reacts in a consistent way to external forces I guess the laws of logic would still apply there but you couldnt really do any inference and eventually it turns people into chaos beasts which arent possible to interact with and which cant interact with the world not the physical world or magic or anything else anyone has tried They are by all accounts happy and think this is cool but it seems awful to me Elysium Chaotic Good is an infinite wilderness The kind of people who go there seem to like it They just wander around exploring Usually never run into anyone else Nirvana turns you into an animal as part of a journey towards Neutral Good which is very non partial Not caring more about you or people you know than about anything else And somehow being turned into an animal helps with that Heaven makes you an angel like Hell makes you a devil Devils are perfectly Lawful Evil and angels are perfectly Lawful Good I guess theres nothing wrong with it but I dont want to be perfectly Lawful Good you know

Thats missing Lawful Neutral Neutral Neutral

Right sorry Neutral Neutrals the Boneyard its where Pharasma sorts everyone Its uh overrun with babies because like half of people die as babies and most adults have alignments but babies generally dont Abaddon used to sneak in and eat the babies but now Hell defends it so they dont I have never heard anything very good about the Boneyard Once you start demonstrating any inclination towards an alignment you get kicked out of it to there instead 

Lawful Neutral is Axis It sounds fine Its a big city unimaginably big The thing you turn into is called an inevitable And theyre just pure Law Axis has a lot of trade with Hell their gods and ours get along

Ill take a closer look at all this someday when Ive got time How hard is it to improve stuff up at that part of existence Not sure any of that sounds Keltham optimal and I have a god who should theoretically be about people doing their own stuff without stepping on each other Do gods carve out their own sections of the afterlife or is it strictly nine to all customers

Gods carve out their own sections which can vary some from the general scheme There might be a spot for your god thats perfect for you that I just havent heard of if your god doesnt talk much I think improving the afterlives without buyin from the relevant gods would be hard and improving it in a way the relevant god likes is a highly encouraged way to spend your afterlife

I wish I could talk to my god or even any of my gods other clerics if they exist Ill mark it down for now as something that is not known to me to be imminently on fire though the whole setup youre describing in dath ilan you could take any large object or institution made by intelligent people and ask exactly why it was the way it was and get a sensible answer about the ways it was optimal To the point that I found it annoying Why is the city eight miles across but not nine miles Because the property prices in the core would increase like so and the benefit at the edges would decrease like so market forecasts et cetera et cetera therefore this way was optimal The thing with the afterlives seems not that

I think it is not that Maybe parts of Hell and Axis are like that but no ones told us about it if so

But the gods are smart or at least are supposed to have very high measured intelligence compared to a human in whatever system youre using and it sounded from other things you said like they had some coordination Is there a metagod with even more alien desires who built the afterlives It doesnt sound like that either and it doesnt sound like the afterlives are as simple and non functional as mountains or rivers Theres something the afterlives are doing but I cant think of anything a smart entity could be trying to do such that those afterlives are doing it optimally given their resources That kind of halfassedness can be a signature of hereditary selection the process I was talking about that built humans systematic accretion of errors according to a fitness metric which in biology is reproduction but it doesnt quite sound like that either 

You asked if my trying to situate my lectures inside of everything was a dath ilani thing or a me thing Its both Were used to knowing where we are inside a larger reality and where all of the order is coming from and why its there Theres pranks that get played on us as children which try to teach us to operate when were wrong about things when we dont know why things are happening so we wont end up mentally fragile and unable to deal with confusion But the fact is that Im used to knowing to within 01 exactly how old my universe is and the names and qualities of every kind of tiny part of reality that we havent reduced to tinier parts Not knowing that does feel quite disorienting like Im walking on air constantly trying to figure out whats holding up my feet

Whereas I am not used to having the slightest idea why anything is happening unless its a magic item

Youre stronger than an average dath ilani would realize from a first glance arent you Its not that you dont know those things because youre not curious but because the answers simply arent available to you and you take for granted that you can operate in that hostile cognitive environment

Well its how did you put it The organisms that cant operate in their environment die the ones that are around are the ones that happened to be better at handling it

Youre handling yourself pretty well for having lived all your life in a place so much safer than this one

Safer yeah But also much less full of opportunity to be the person and take the role that I wanted I wouldnt step into a portal back if you opened one in front of me Neither a Good dath ilani or an Evil dath ilani would do that in the end only a weak one and I dont aspire to be weak

You know its very rude saying things like that when you still havent worked out a payment agreement with our government so people can fuck you

More direct than hes used to but not unpleasant Embarrassingly I think Im blocked on figuring out how to calculate the actual benefit to your breeding program of tossing in a huge batch of new intelligence alleles given that you do already have people as smart as me Theres a theorem about how the speed of improvement goes as the covariance of reproductive variance with the variance of the quality selected on and that means I need to figure out how adding a batch of different alleles increases the variance its not as simple as adding on some more intelligence I also feel a need to know something about how my kids would grow up Its not the Good answer because my kids would be displacing other kids that would exist and I dont see how my kids would be expected to lead worse lives than the stupider people whod otherwise exist in terms of how that affects total utility but I think I feel some Evil attachment to my own personal kids

He cant come right out and say this next part it just feels too weird not to put some level of indirection in it where he doesnt come straight out and become the petitioner for sex

Dath ilan has also figured out some alternatives to reproductive sex besides the standard methods of contraception and even people with contraception have been known to use those alternatives For much the same reason that wizards here fling themselves off cliffs or have sportfights with ostriches I know it wasnt ostriches but I forget which animal you said it was That gives Carissa an out if she doesnt want to reply directly to the line of conversation about non reproductive sex

Bulls And I bet weve invented more of those than you have what with being under the much stronger constraint of not having contraception

I dont know if I personally know enough to take on your civilizations collective knowledge by myself I dont have much actual experience of variants and its considered mildly unwise to let your reading get too far ahead of your experiences there But I bet at strong odds that dath ilan generally has invented more sexual variations than Golarion Because we have more total people with more free time that they see nothing better to spend on than sexual variations who have access to better aggregated repositories of information about whats already been tried Unless youve got gods specifically of variant sexuality or magic opens up whole new spaces there that we cant access at all in which case all bets are off and also I should like to know more

I hope you meant me to take that as a challenge

Shes pushing hard Its clear that shes decided on Keltham

Has Keltham decided on Carissa becomes the question

Part of him is scared but its the kind of fear where its a reflex thought that the correct action is probably to overcome it Keltham has never aspired to be weak He has no intention of going around never actually having sex for the rest of his life Having just jumped worlds there are all kinds of reasons why itd be wiser to have sex with a relatively older woman first before getting involved with the younger women in his research harem Carissa is attractive on a purely physical level part of him is quite clear on wanting her physically

He doesnt know Carissa all that well But he feels any respect for her which is probably a good sign She was at the Worldwound in the face of danger and then dropped that to come here right away in the face of uncertainty You could make the case for her as a strong risk taking woman with goals But he doesnt quite know what those goals are or how her career was advanced by being at the Worldwound they dont really know each other that well Quick flings can work or so hes been advised but only when both sides know thats exactly what it is as hes also been advised

Oh its a challenge on at least some level What level exactly thats the question I suppose among other things a potential challenger might wonder what his new world would make of a stronger challenge like that being issued by him and taken up whether his new world saw any implicit promises as being issued in either direction Even implicit promises like somebody having already decided that theres a real chance of something longer term because that decision would require more information than I have right now to make one way or another I dont default on debts and that means I need to know when Im taking them on

Hes 

 asking whether he would be making a commitment Because he wouldnt want her to think he wants more than he does

Thats adorable 

Its also completely ridiculous but shes not going to laugh at him 

Where Im from promises are made explicitly and sex isnt one People do what they like and if they like it a lot they might do it again and if their wants are conditioned on the other persons attitudes then theyd better ask about those And be good at telling if theyre being lied to but somehow she expects Keltham would be distracted by the revelation that in Cheliax people lie to get laid I do not in fact want you particularly conditionally But the flip side of that is that if you have conditions youre going to have to figure them out

Conventional wisdom for some totally other world thats not this world has it that people our age having fun with each other sometimes find that spiraling into further events Sometimes it means they have more fun than they expected sometimes it means that theyve got to deal with some stuff that didnt work out or got unexpectedly broken and then move on It is said there that this is one of those cases where theres a big ol residual chance even after youve reasonably estimated it to be unlikely Im hardly going to be against young people being reckless investors and plunging into exciting new projects without total and complete information But another worlds conventional wisdom seems to hold it important that people both be on the same page about being like yeah we both know were being young here wed rather plunge ahead and deal with the residual chance of unpredictable consequences than spend our youth being timid and passing up on chances

Carissa is pretty sure that getting heartbroken is a thing that can only happen to you if you make the mistake of caring about other people or at least about what other people think of you and that dath ilan didnt suggest the obvious solution of dont care about other people or expect them to care about you because theyre Good She suspects though that this is an unsexy thing to say 

Were young she says And were playing games with very high stakes such that this isnt by comparison I wonder if the warning seems more necessary in a world where its not true of everything you do that it might hurt much worse than you expected But Id rather live in this world than in yours just like you would and Id rather have you than not even though I might get hurt on any given occasion and almost definitely will get hurt looking out ahead over all of them

The words hit harder than Keltham expected them to hit Its the kind of thing you might hear in a dath ilani science fiction romance spoken on a spaceship in assorted plot jeopardies but the words hit a lot harder when you are in an impossible scenario and a woman is saying those things to you

Consider yourself challenged Carissa Sevar

See overexcited batch of chattering wizard students thats how you seduce people I hope youre taking notes 

Theyre totally taking notes

She stands up I accept your challenge Keltham I have some logic homework and if Im not going to have time for it tonight Id better do it now Cant have anyone thinking I only get good scores because Im sleeping with my teacher

 Who would possibly design an institution where the same people responsible for teaching were responsible for scoring the learning metrics thats like an electrical diagram with the worlds most obvious short circuit
 Do people do that sort of thing here
 Possible priority within the Basic Stuff explain how education works literally at all
 He is not going to ask any of that right now he needs to come up with a witty romantic reply

Oh Im far too Lawful for such a thing by local standards Just dont expect me to be Lawful at all times

Whats Chaotic in dath ilan hair pulling

Surprises Shit now hes got to come up with something to back that up well hes got time

This is going to be so much fun if it doesnt get her killed 

She leaves the room to do her logic homework immediately go invisible and poke her head back in just for a minute

Keltham will be eating more of his food and wearing the fixed look of concentration of somebody trying to figure out which very standard dath ilani sex techniques in his very standard repertoire that he did not expand much because he had other life priorities would be able to cash in that Surprises promissory note An obvious place to start would be to figure out which bits of standard technique would have no corollary inside a mess like Golarion while still being executable by him actually that does narrow down the search a whole lot A vibrator would probably surprise Carissa but of course he doesnt have access to a vibrator Okay if he narrows it down from that angle theres an obvious possible surprise to try

Keltham is also trying to figure out what Carissa could have possibly meant by hair pulling If he just straightforwardly visualizes somebody pulling on his hair it could be a moment of spontaneously passionate embrace but mostly it would just yank his head back and if it was hard enough to hurt it would hurt Though oddly enough when Keltham tries to visualize the case where Carissa could have meant him pulling her hair if she hadnt mentioned that in a sexual context his unrevised first guess would be that it should just make her say ouch But when he visualizes that producing a sexual response from her instead that seems to be booping on some internal sexual part of him that hasnt been booped before

Yeah hes probably going to lose this contest Thats what happens when you challenge somebody older and more experienced It doesnt mean hes going to lose without dignity

Keltham eats some more of his food with the absorbed look of a horny teenaged male who knows he is in over his head and who is going to swim that fucking pool anyways

 okay she is not going to let this distract her from her main priority here which is becoming a perfect devil before shes even dead This is actually if you think about it not a distraction from that goal because the closer she is with Keltham the more incredibly annoying and difficult it would be to execute her for heresy 

She turns and leaves the room again and this time actually tries studying her logic homework

Keltham will eventually turn his thoughts back to further lesson plans if nobody has interrupted him yet he does not conceptualize himself as a man too thirsty to get important work done

He makes a mental note about sending a respectfully brief letter to Lrilatha mentioning his concern about lowering child mortality in a way that might run ahead of agriculture and if thats safe to discuss with Chelish humans y n along with a numerical scale brief question asking whether Keltham should be sending fewer or more letters like that in the future 21 01 2 And a mental note to ask about getting one of Iroris books on the remote chance that it contains a ton of useful exercises for making people less imperfect He doesnt think a handy guidebook like that should be a thing that already existed here given that Golarion is still Golarion but it sounds worth checking maybe they only got halfway and Keltham can provide the other half Oh he shouldve asked whether Irori counted as Neutral Evil or what exactly Keltham still isnt sure he has this alignment thing down at all

No one interrupts him for the rest of lunch though several girls look like theyre agonizing over whether to

Then Keltham shall eventually make his way over to the harem tables once they look to be past their hypothetical initial food rush and once he himself has eaten enough food to no longer feel imminently hungry plus 20 in case the unfamiliar flavors are causing him to underestimate energy demands or hes overestimating later food availability His set point is stable and if he accidentally takes in excess food its not going to change anything long term obviously

Hey Wanna tell me about anything Im doing wrong as a teacher Its been a while since I was an older kid teaching younger kids and this time I dont have a Watcher backing me up plus Im in another plane so Im not going to be surprised if youve got complaints

Having a date with Carissa makes it easier to go talk to the research harem about other stuff theyre not going to be trying to grab him for this night

 probably

They look baffled by this question

Im not very clear on how we are evaluated Meritxell offers after a moment of silence 

Thats very legitimate but not one I can solve in 5 minutes sorry I dont have all the measuring instruments wed have at home I cant just go to the store and buy standard tests for how youre doing at learning predicate logic or calculus and if Im going to have to improvise that Id better not do it right here on the spot Success metrics are hugely important on any operation I dont dare half ass them I cant even promise that Ill manage to find somebody other than myself to evaluate all aspects of your short term performance separately from my being the one who teaches you even though in dath ilan wed think it was hugely stupid to have the teacher be the student evaluator Like general issues of Lawfulness aside wed usually consider it to be a blatantly obvious matter of optimal institutional design that there be a separate student evaluator that students would theoretically have to sleep with in order to obtain better grades whos not the same person responsible for teaching the students in the first place And wed also be looking for forms of evaluation that were easy for a higher Watcher to spot check and catch out any lower Watchers whod done it incorrectly for sexual reasons or otherwise I cant promise you any of that it may not even end up being the practical priority and I ask for your understanding and forbearance about that given the incredibly weird circumstances

Though I mean in the long term theres an obvious team metric where we look at the gross domestic product of Cheliax and Golarion and see if we pushed it above trend or measure how much money we made by selling better metals and agricultural implements

Excited giggles 

Thats fine Meritxell says Anyway if youre sleeping with everybody then theres no question of it affecting anyones grades unfairly

Oh come on youre not going to all have the same skills at sex Keltham reflexively points out the obvious invalidity in this argument before his central monitoring loop has had even the slightest chance to think about it at all

Meritxell seems to think this a completely reasonable response I dont think the mechanism by which grades get altered by sleeping with the teacher is bias I think its inducement so as long as you think everyones doing their best theres no incentive to toy with their grades even if some people have a better best She nibbles her lower lip Even though some people have a better best

To be clear I think wed want to rigorously separate sexual performance from research performance and not get those confused into one metric over a person Id frankly expect both you and the Chelish government to be pissed about the performance hit to the world economy if I got confused that way That said itd be conventional practice in dath ilan to pay people proportionally to their apparent output not whether people are doing their best Its a lot easier to measure how well somebody is doing than to know whether theyre really doing their best And theres an implied incentive that seems really awful to me for people to be weaker for their best to be worse if you pay them to do their best Even very Good people in dath ilan wouldnt do that its not Lawful

Thats how Cheliax does punishments says Asmodia I have never heard it applied to sexual favors except informally because you can only get anywhere if you have something to offer but probably that is because we are insufficiently Lawful and havent thought it through properly

People mostly dont actually sleep with their instructors for better grades Gregoria clarifies Probably if it were widespread people wouldve noticed how to do it Lawfully even here

With punishments though theres some sense in scaling like you want to evaluate second years against second years not second years against fifth years in deciding who is underperforming because its just not informative if your process concludes that all the second years are underperforming

Okay yeah thats been puzzling me for a while the books referred to it too like there was this one book supposedly by a magic instructor who spends the first chapter telling you about what a great magic instructor he is where he mentions punishing students at the end of the day so it wont interrupt their learning If that was literally true and not a weird collection of lies Im so confused about this for multiple reasons that I dont even know where to start asking If Im like hey give me your shoes for twenty silver pieces and you value your shoes less than that it makes sense to give me your shoes If instead Im like hey give me your shoes or Ill put you in an armlock and break your arm and you actually do that because the value of the shoes is less to you than the value of the unbroken arm then the fact that you reacted that way is the reason why I made the threat in the first place right I mean assuming Im the sort of ideal entity who doesnt have any altruism or any inherent desire to behave in a coordinated way with others if I can go around collecting everyones shoes by threatening to break their arms why wouldnt I just go collect all their shoes So in the they dont have the word counterfactual lovely unreal branch of reality where I threaten to break your arm you fight and punch me in the face and dont give me your shoes even though it costs you a broken arm and since I know thats how it will go I dont actually threaten to break your arm and the branch of reality stays unreal

I mean I can guess that you arent trained in ways of thinking about real and unreal branches of reality and playing complex strategies over them But I would have thought it would be more like human instinct to punch somebody in the face if they threaten to break your arm if you dont give them your shoes I mean we get training thats about how we have instincts like that and we need to carefully refine them so they actually lead to optimal real world outcomes And then here it sounds like there is a whole lot more of people punching each other in reality and then youve got students supposedly paying somebody to punch them in the face and that I just do not get at all

The students are confused

The soul learns through incentives Asmodia says after a while Incentives like if I do this thing it works out nicely for me and I get a glow of satisfaction but also incentives like if I fuck this up itll hurt The way to teach children not to touch a hot stove is to let them once and then theyll know Because the soul is wired to understand feedback from pain faster than it understands feedback from anything else I am aware you may not have souls in dath ilan and I dont know if this still applies without them

No magical healing we try to avoid children touching hot stoves once I think if dath ilan could get faster learning by no thats not valid reasoning on my part they could attach enough disutility to the students experience of pain that they still wouldnt do it so its not much evidence that they dont do it already I guess Im still skeptical that youre describing a system thats actually locally optimal and that people arent messing up Because if you get an electrical shock for a wrong math answer thats a kind of pain we could inflict without lasting injury if we wanted to go that route then you dont just learn not to answer math problems wrongly Id expect you to also learn not to answer math problems and not to go to classes in some deep part of you that you cant consciously override And it sounded like from something Carissa mentioned earlier people end up afraid to point out what looks like an error by the teacher because if theyre wrong about that they might get pain inflicted on them That sounds like exactly the kind of incredibly obvious failure mode Id expect to develop if somebody had the bright idea of trying to use pain to teach things but you were also so bad at institutional design that students could get better grades by sleeping with the teacher I would have been a lot less cooperative with the older kids teaching me if Id been getting punched by them for errors instead of paid by my parents for successes

You definitely have to have the punishments arranged competently by people who know how to do it Asmodia says It sounds like the teacher in the book you read was arguing that the end of the day is a better timing in order to get the benefits without creating side incentives you dont want Though in practice I dont think its a very big problem certainly there are not students who are uncooperative so we cant be doing whatever wouldve caused you to be uncooperative

I do not understand how the system you describe is in equilibrium but that can probably wait for another day Are you going to be okay if my teaching style is built entirely out of rewards for success instead of punishments for failure Because I do not know how to do punishments competently

We were selected for this because were top students we can handle weird or limited incentives

And if we want someone to whip us to help a lesson sink in we can arrange that outside of class Pilar says with a glance at Paxti

Something inside him has an unusual feeling about that but Keltham does not know what it is and its not his priority right now

I should ask this explicitly are you using mind affecting spells to put yourself in an optimal state for learning It looked to me like during the whole lesson you only varied between the states of Attentiveness Enthusiasm and Great Enthusiasm even when I said things that I wouldve expected to put somebody into an angrier state if they hadnt been explicitly trained in dignity Not saying youre doing anything wrong there it just seems like the sorta thing a teacher should know about

 I think Cheliax also conducts training in dignity says Asmodia We werent using magic at least I wasnt

A chorus of other I wasnts

Well thats good the dignity training part I mean Though I should check how does the word dignity translate to you Whats some concrete examples of dignity

Keltham has just tried a mental experiment of his own and found that there are at least three different Baseline terms that all mentally translate to him as the Taldane word dignity

WHY is EVEN LUNCHTIME full of IMPOSSIBLE HIGH STAKES TESTS 

 dignity is remaining composed when situations are frustrating or frightening and staying focused on the situation and not on your emotions

Dignity is conducting yourself like a person other people can rely on to be serious not reacting childishly to things not needing people to accommodate your human weaknesses

Dignity is carrying yourself like youre important

All right I think I might have managed to put my finger on a quiet nagging doubt I had before Keltham says totally oblivious to any signs of INNER PANIC this might be producing unless somebody actually shows it to him

Theres at least three different Baseline words that translate as dignity in this language But the one I had in mind is not getting angry at people for behaving the way theyre supposed to or in ways they have a right to do Not showing outward anger not letting yourself react inwardly in a way that could lead you to subconsciously lower their grades later or the equivalent of that Its the quality that you display to others so that theyll know its safe to turn you down for sex even though youre acting as a manager and if you werent confident youd shown that much dignity youd be afraid to invite them for sex Dignity in the case of my relation to students as a teacher means that if I make my own mistake on the whiteboard and you point it out I dont even internally blame you for my mistake and give you a bad performance review later Nobody who lacked that kind of dignity would be tapped to give performance reviews Very few higher managers would be stupid enough to promote a manager who was visibly bad enough at dignity that employees would be afraid to tell them what they were doing wrong We go through training to avoid that being true of us even subconsciously where our conscious minds wouldnt notice

If youre not in a state of fixed enthusiasm produced by mind affecting spells then its very odd if I just started up teaching again after not doing that for years in another dimension across an unknown huge cultural gap in a non native language thats translated in my mind by spell and didnt make any mistakes I was wordlessly expecting somebody in the class to go wrong thats not how you teach Chelish students and that never happened It might locally pain me some tiny bit to be told that but its the kind of hurt thats intrinsic to learning not to do something again not what Id classify as the dath ilani word that translates as punishment in the Lawful sense of that the kind of hurt where youre deliberately making it worse because youre trying to influence my behavior by imposing costs on me

So if my concept of dignity is all about thinking and acting in a way that makes there be negligible real social disincentives for you to inform me about my mistakes even if I didnt ask and your version of dignity is about always looking cheerful and enthusiastic and not giving me any visible sign that Im making mistakes unless I ask there mightve been an inter cultural problem

The students still do not visibly display any distress Although maybe theyre supposed to This is such an unfair test

I wouldnt mind telling you if I think if something youre doing wrong Meritxell says after a moment somewhat truthfully But no one in Cheliax is going to tell you by being visibly distressed or confused thats not how people in Cheliax communicate things so you wont want to read anything into that We are competent to tell you with words thats not undignified

Yeah So asking in words now were there any memorable points in class where if Id remembered to ask you would have told me I was teaching suboptimally even though nobody was showing visible signs of confusion or distress

Meritxell will keep going with this even though it might be a disaster Well you were teaching really differently from how its done in Cheliax and if a Chelish teacher were teaching that way I would think they werent very good since it involved so much being confused but you said you were doing that on purpose and that its part of all the techniques were supposed to be learning

I sure was trying to bewilder you on purpose for reasons I was probably also trying harder and harder to bewilder you because you never showed any overt emotional signs of being bewildered

Im actually running into a small stumbling block about trying to explain mentally why its better to give wrong answers than no answers It feels too obvious to explain I mean I vaguely remember being told about experiments where if you dont do that people sort of revise history inside their own heads and arent aware of the processes inside themselves that would have produced the previous wrong or suboptimal answer If you dont make people notice theyre confused theyll go back and revise history and think that the way they already thought wouldve handled the questions perfectly fine

 well you definitely succeeded at being confusing

Do Chelish teachers just not ask questions unless you already know how to answer

 not usually If a question is asked that suggests you are supposed to be competent to answer it

Unless I am severely misunderstanding something that sounds like a truly basic mistake that could be crippling your entire process of education especially of the people who are supposed to be producing intense thought based products like research The most important hidden orders begin as questions you dont know the real answers are things you havent seen that may resemble nothing youve seen before they may require new instruments and new kinds of thinking to figure out Dath ilani are trained from childhood to answer questions they have no idea how to answer and on a really fundamental level that is why that civilization now knows any stuff

The students blink at him 

That seems important Asmodia ventures after a minute It might only work for smart people though

No kidding Dath ilan has enough scale a billion people slightly less that it can adapt different educational processes for different levels of intelligence If somebody took an educational system that was implicitly designed for average intelligence in this world and then just tried to throw a bunch of smarter kids through the same system Im wondering if I should maybe be giving an Early Basics talk on like how to teach and learn at all Or if I should be leading by example there for a while before presuming to write up how anything should work in Cheliax

My understanding says Meritxell is that if we turn out well theyll adopt it more widely and if we turn out terribly then they wont

I think if we start to get good results early they should figure out twenty variations on education and test those early Human capital accumulation is one of the classic examples of an input to the total production cycle that takes a long linear time and cant be shortened by throwing more money at it But sure I can wait to argue that part with Governance for another week

 Im sorry its just occurred to me that its lunchtime were talking about work things and I need to ask out loud in words if youd rather be talking about its not ostriches but for some weird reason my brain is repeatedly having this hiccup where it thinks that the sportfights are with ostriches instead of whatever it actually is

 probably we could get people to fight ostriches if you want Bullfights are traditional We usually work during lunch at school recreation is for holy days

Im sorry again I couldnt actually focus on this without more effort than I think wise My brain is repeatedly calling attention to the point that this has been your first formal learning experience with structural uncertainty Was it fun awful funawful I can go away if you dont want to think about work until we resume but it doesnt sound like thats your usual rule

It was really interesting

I think I learned a lot

Im worried it will have bad side effects but the direct effects didnt seem bad

Some of the warnings Lrilatha gave him make more sense now unfortunately which he maybe should have expected from talking to a Very Serious Person Her warnings suddenly sound much more like things that could actually happen instead of far flung failure modes

A lot of the warnings I got back as a kid suddenly seem a lot more like they might be necessary and important if somebody didnt have a lot of actual experience with what its like to usefully think weird and unusual thoughts pointing in odd directions Look theres a very basic warning which first gets told in the form of a joke about a patient who goes to the doctor complaining that his arm starts to hurt if he folds it all the way behind his back and the doctor says Well first of all if it hurts stop doing it If you start feeling like it is a perfectly logical and inevitable conclusion from the Law Ive taught that you need to destroy this universe talk to me talk to somebody who works fairly directly for Asmodeus and first of all stop twisting up like that just literally pause until youve talked to somebody because that is not supposed to be an inevitable conclusion from dath ilani premises Reasoning under structural uncertainty is legit harder and easier to screw up than reasoning when you already know exactly how youre supposed to think which is boringly easy by comparison Youre going to suck at it for a while If you arrive at the necessary truth that you must fling yourself into the sea dont

The girls nod fervently 

I need to think I may not need to think more than you need to have urgent questions answered so interrupt me if its important but I need to think Its I wondered how Golarion managed to be screwed up when it had Very Serious Lawful Devils and frigging gods but now Im visualizing dath ilan has put this massive effort by a lot of people with very high measured intelligence into optimizing everything important which I dont think I really appreciated before and in this world somebody put the childrens lessons together in a way where the person teaching them is also responsible for measuring the results And nobody else is checking on their measurements And all of the questions are supposed to be things the children have already been taught how to answer And the regional numbers of children are too small and travel is too expensive to sort each lesson by current knowledge and velocity of learning so the people I consider to be of average intelligence are just being thrown into a scaled up version of whatever has to teach people much dumber than them how to do ultra basic algebra and Im realizing that every single aspect of Golarion must be that screwed up simultaneously

Keltham is visualizing what Lrilathas day must be like She probably walked straight out of this villa and teleported directly to somewhere else where she had to stop somebody from being a massive idiot and plugging all the outputs of the iron factories back into their inputs and then teleported again and then again and does her species even get to sleep and how many of her are there in all of Cheliax three she cant fix things on a deep level because the human problems arent her problems she doesnt know how to tell people to do it systematically better because the current educational system wouldnt hurt her the same way and Kelthams god isnt talking to him and theres some massive communication barrier that made it easier for Asmodeus to point vaguely in Kelthams direction than to give detailed instructions to anyone and this whole situation is so much more messed up than he previously realized

Youre really going to hate all the other countries in the world says Asmodia 

Carissa and Lrilatha both warned me

Keltham waits to see if anyone has anything urgent to add to that and then goes off to think by himself A few seconds later he comes back and asks somebody to actually tell him when his stated time for lunch is over because he doesnt have a wristwatch anymore

He gets several volunteers to get him when its time

Keltham thinks He also takes small bits of additional food and arranges them in weird patterns on his plate without eating them so he has something to distract his brain when it overheats Keltham does not think that food is supposed to be valuable particularly not food on this level of elaboration

Pros If this hypothesis is correct there will be lots of things that Keltham can very very easily say how to improve
Cons Many dath ilani solutions will not work out of the box because they rely on other stuff already working

Three girls come over to get him at once when its the end of lunchtime

Keltham has managed to rally himself by this point Fine so instead of having the metaphorical opportunity to take over a company in a green field with no competition he has the metaphorical opportunity to take over a company every single part of which is simultaneously wrong in a green field with no competition So He just has to repair enough things and then theyll work Whats he going to do give up on that without trying No Is he going to complain when his immediate prospects include a date with Carissa tonight and hes been assigned a research harem More no All of his no What kind of reply would that be to Chelish Governance providing him with large opportunities He just has to rise to the challenge make all the money fuck all the women and fix all of the universes deficiencies

All thats changed is that he now has some idea of the actual scope of the problem Off to the library again he goes

Keltham continues to have no idea of the actual scope of the problem The horrifying planetwide disaster of universally awful institutional design that Keltham is currently envisioning is somewhere around 1 as dysfunctional as say an alternate Prime Material with a roughly equivalent tech level to dath ilans but the modal social outcome for that He continues to not be mentally on the same page as Golarion nor indeed the same book same language same library same city same planet or same laws of physics as Golarion

Carissa has a plan for the afternoon which is to pay attention to the actual lesson She recalls from her days in school that this was usually a good idea And shes pretty sure she should wait before she tries to completely reform the teachings of Asmodeanism on the Material Plane 

To make sure everybody starts out on the same page Keltham will quickly summarize earlier conversations for the benefit of any harem members who might not have been in hearing range for it He still isnt distinguishing them all that well and didnt actually count them if somebody was in the washroom or something He definitely knows Carissa was absent for some of it

Things Keltham summarizes

 Keltham is not sure how important it actually is to understand where everything you know is situated within the order of larger reality but dath ilan sure does situate all of it and maybe thats important he doesnt know Hopefully he doesnt have to burn more than a couple of hours here and there on situating things
 Most adult dath ilani are running around thinking that they know the universes age to within 01 and all the names and qualities of its tiny parts that havent been reduced to even tinier parts The very smart people of dath ilan actually the prediction markets but hell explain that in more detail later have predicted how this could otherwise make people weak and unable to handle mental adversity which is why the adults play a lot of confusing pranks on children in case they someday end up in Golarion or something Like they werent literally anticipating this exact event or theyd have gone a lot harder on his pranks But it sure is why Keltham is hitting the ground running instead of curling up in a ball whining about structural uncertainty
 And similarly Even ordinary life means sometimes facing questions you dont know how to answer Doing basic research means facing questions whose answers are very unlike all the questions and answers youve studied before Keltham regrets to inform Cheliax that only asking kids questions they already know how to answer seems like it would obviously leave them weak and unprepared for real intellectual challenges Hes pretty sure this is true of people at their own intelligence level less sure about people with average or below average intelligence for Golarion
 Keltham does apologize for presenting his students with confusing questions when they werent used to that had no idea why he was doing that and also didnt have any meta idea of why hed be doing stuff they didnt understand
 Keltham will try to remember to check in verbally about how people are doing since Chelish pride permits verbal answers about that but seems to prohibit overt visual displays of confusion If Keltham seems to be forgetting to do this he hopes somebody will remind him in words even if Cheliax considers that slightly undignified As an older kid teaching younger kids he expected the younger kids to give much more overt signals of how well he was doing as a teacher
 Dath ilan doesnt have magical healing and they sure dont have resurrections Hence despite all their intellectual toughening procedures they dont have any equivalent of like teaching kids how to walk on broken legs so that they can mentally divorce physical pain from long term damage If Cheliax trains its kids to be strong in that particular way Keltham has not gone through this training yet and this is probably not the right time either
 Correspondingly if inflicting physical pain is considered an important element in Cheliax of training subconscious intuitions Keltham has no idea how to do that professionally and hopes theyll excuse him from it Keltham separately may end up making a case that rewards often work better than punishments because you can scale rewards directly to performance instead of a problematic notion of are people doing their best plus the brain learns from forgone rewards similarly in many ways to punishment but hed have to understand this entire system better before he started feeling confident about critiquing that element specifically
 It does seem specifically worrisome to Keltham that in a punishment based system youd have to worry about people taking safer less challenging lessons and trying not to give outward signs that their potential was high enough to do better if their subconscious was learning to avoid pain inflicted for doing less than their best Maybe hes totally off base in worrying about that and Cheliax has already solved it somehow But the reason Keltham is bringing that up immediately is to emphasize that he is going to continue throwing confusing questions at them and this is not meant to be a threatening overly difficult problem whose painful failures they need to avoid its meant to be an overly difficult problem they can safely hang out around and safely fail on without that hurting
 Itd be particularly dumb if Keltham started throwing more difficult problems at them they got hurt more for failing or just got scared of failing and some deep part of their brain learned the lesson that facing actual confusing cognitive problems is scarier and more painful than facing easy fake cognitive problems That is why Keltham now emphasizes the point that whatever problems they were trying to solve in their education before this object level failure will be punished less because this is new to them and their best is worse than it was on easier problems also because Keltham doesnt know how to teach that way at all and above all success on these new harder problems is more valuable and during equity negotiations he will ensure that it is accordingly better paid

That all seems reasonable They think that probably Kelthams teaching style will be fine for them it would also be silly if learning how to focus with broken legs meant you couldnt focus without broken legs

If theres a mistake it has to be less obvious than punishment not working as well as rewards for humans no shes going to not think about this and focus on the lesson

Also shes never skipping lunch again

This afternoon Keltham is going to try conveying some of the absolute basics about population heredity dynamics which was on his mind during lunch today for reasons which need not be explained Keltham actually says this part out loud These basics are not all of the knowledge Keltham has out of dath ilan about heredity there are advanced tricks hes deliberately not going to cover until theyre bought from him but hes wondering if even the basics will be self evidently useful enough that it gets him enough credit with the Chelish government to cover things like Detect Magic goggles

Also after his experience with how Chelish education is configured and having been told where the average Intelligence on this planet has ended up he feels some degree of concern and a need to check that current heritage optimization programs are not being run like backwards Keltham says this out loud too

Before he launches into his own lecture whatre Cheliaxs current knowledge or hypotheses about heredity and how have they set up whatever current heritage optimization programs theyre running for crops domesticated animals and people

Cheliax knows that children inherit traits from their parents The dominant theory is that girls mostly inherit psychological traits from their mothers and boys from their fathers based on how it works in the species of marshbirds where a famous wizard did a bunch of seminal breeding experiments but some people think humans are more like dogs in inheriting from both parents certainly in skin and hair humans can take after either parent Humans hybridize with elves drow orcs sylphs and hybridize inconsistently offspring rare often sterile with angels devils and elementals polymorphed humanoid and dont hybridize with halflings or gnomes or catfolk or gnolls or giants or goblins or merfolk Human hybrids with elves are half elves and with orcs are half orcs but human hybrids by dwarves if they live at all will fully resemble dwarves and be sterile

Cheliax is divided on whether to try to reduce the percentage of children who die of disease for reasons related to heredity toughness is heritable and if you start saving the half of kids that currently die possibly youll be raising a generation of adults with fundamental weaknesses in their blood which theyll pass along such that future generations get weaker and weaker That seems like one way you could run a heritage optimization program backwards and theyre not doing that

Cheliax pays students who graduated with good grades from wizard school to have children though talented wizards usually have lots of ways to make money and its more about communicating that theyre doing a thing valuable to Cheliax than about shifting their financial incentives much Wizards actually have fewer children than other people because they can choose whether they become pregnant and other people cant but Kelthams reportedly going to introduce technology to let everyone do that which should help on that front

Okay yes Yes if smart people have fewer children because they have better access to contraception and nobody is like doing anything about that that could be a problem yes This is frankly something Keltham has never even imagined as a catastrophic failure mode of a civilization but that could have been over past generations a very large cumulative problem yes How good that anyone on Golarion has finally potentially noticed this is an issue The good contraceptive technology that dath ilan uses is unfortunately not trivial on the tech ladder but Keltham can explain how to research things ever and they can hopefully find some better makeshifts than whatever people are doing now Cheap makeshifts Which a sensible government will subsidize

That interbreeding stuff is fascinating from a seeking hidden order perspective but Keltham will explain why in more length later

Does Cheliax have any kind of thinking thats about like why are there equal numbers of men and women at least among humans Assuming there are If there arent Keltham is going to have to check a few things and then potentially back out a number of his assumptions

There are equal numbers of men and women except in countries that kill baby girls which is definitely some of them but not Cheliax because Cheliax doesnt suck They are not aware of thinking thats about that specifically Its also true of most animals its not just a human thing

Why would it be true of humans and most animals Theres a reason for it a hidden order behind it

Guess wrongly this is the dath ilani way of education and you are not always expected to know when the teacher asks a question because you will not always know the answer when real life asks you a question and in both cases you must gather your scattered and inadequate thoughts and manage to say out loud your first guess so you at least know what you dont know and where your current thoughts point If all your thoughts are wrong and you know it say both your best seeming current thought and the reason it must be wrong Much discovery of hidden order begins like this do not refuse to venture forth

There are some nervous giggles at this

Then they start speculating

There might be some agreement of the gods about it though thatd be less likely to cover animals

Children are made from a boy and a girl so maybe their making involves getting boy and girl inputs and then drawing at random which turns into a child which would get you half and half

Maybe souls come out half and half and then bodies that dont get a soul die so you see half and half among live births

Suppose you were designing humans from scratch Would you make them to have equal numbers of men and women Dont consider as constraints things like the balance of male and female desire for sex or mates you could if you like say that there would be twice as many men as women and women who on average desired twice as much sex as men if you were designing the human species from scratch What would be the consequences if you were designing the species from scratch and you said there should be twice as many men as women or twice as many women as men

Well a lot of peopled have a hard time getting laid is the main thing But you wouldnt actually go for equal numbers if you were optimizing for that because men generally want sex more than women youd go for maybe two to one or three to one

 actually observes Meritxell mostly women seems better You can increase your population faster because more people can bear children and the men can get around and its easier to attract foreign men than foreign women anyway And she thinks women are better citizens on average Lawfuller

Less likely to be adventurers and a country without adventurers is dead by a thousand cuts no matter how many babies theyre having

Ah well those are interesting puzzles in their own right arent they Why are women Lawfuller Why are men more likely than women to become adventurers Keltham knows the answers already even though hes a stranger to the planet because it was the same way in dath ilan Hes not going to tell them the answer just yet theyre welcome to try to see it on their own if they can and maybe they even will before he gets around to giving away the answers If so he will be duly impressed

But return back to the original question Suppose again you are designing humans from scratch Why not twice as many women as men and also have the women be as likely as current men to become adventurers Wouldnt a group like that be able to increase faster because more people could bear children

 possibly you need some scarcity of women to motivate the men to be adventurers and if they had girls either way then theyd all just lounge around doing nothing no offense to present company who is admittedly a counterexample But the average person might be motivated by it being the case that they can have sex if they work hard and not otherwise best achieved by balance 

It seems like youd make people as Lawful as you could if you were making them and its not clear why thatd be Lawfuler for women than for men And same with propensity to be an adventurer no well you dont want everyone being an adventurer some of them have to stay home making the institutions function 

 maybe theres a tradeoff in human psychology between Lawfulness and adventurer tendency

In countries where people kill their daughters they do it because men are more valuable under the local cultural regime where women are hardly allowed to do anything And presumably if enough people did that then eventually daughters would become valuable again as the men wanted wives So youd end up with as many living women as made daughters as valuable as sons Or with across the board infanticide if no children were valuable to have

Keltham reminds himself again that the whole afterlife thing is obviously going to lead to different local mores about death just as the existence of healing magic has led to different local mores about pain killing babies here does not mean the same thing that killing or cryo suspending babies would in dath ilan It wouldnt be surprising if the whole pre afterlife world operates as a tiny adjunct to a much larger afterlife only of note to gods and a higher economy because its the part of reality that provides the afterlife with its intake feed Some of the attitudes ascribed to countries outside Cheliax definitely give that impression

Keltham also notes that Carissa seems to be able to follow the thread of an argument better than others here Hes not used to thinking of that as an adult capability per se but maybe it takes a lot more life experience to follow threads of argument if you have like very little formal training in it

Ah well if you value having more of your own children then if the human species had been designed to birth ten times as many female children as male you might wish yourself to have more male children It would not necessarily be any better in terms of producing a functioning species the species could get along fine with each male having to do ten times as much work of fertilizing women It doesnt take that long well if youre doing it right it takes longer but not so long that a male couldnt fertilize another female the next day Still if the rest of your species gave birth to ten times as many women as men and yet you could manage to birth only men yourself you would have a lot more grandchildren than the average women

And yet what difference does any of that make What difference does it make as to what some woman wants to herself when it comes to how the human species works as a whole At least in dath ilan women cannot choose the sex of their child by just an act of will Then how can their wants control the balance of female and male births across the whole species Ill tell you right now the answer isnt that there is some mysterious channel by which the emotions of women collectively control the balance of births you might have to look at things a little sideways to get it But even if you cant get it guess anyways 

Oh and dont forget if you can guess why your guess might be wrong say that part too Youre not trying to convince me of your guess this isnt like wacky Chelish books youre not trying to tell me just one side of a story like youre selling me your guess as a product and trying to get a higher price on it by concealing information while hoping I dont realize youre concealing information I mean if you want to sell me anything in real life sell me on how good you are at reasoning That means when you tell me your best guess you should try to figure out how your best guess might be wrong if you can see why its probably wrong if you can already see something that doesnt fit with your guess tell me that part too Remember when real life hands you a problem it wont tell you when you guess wrong the way a teacher in a classroom tells you when youre wrong In actual real life its your job to figure out why your best guess might still be wrong Dath ilani teachers let kids stay wrong about some things for years and older kids are forbidden to tell younger kids about them

Well people cant decide what overall population ratio makes the most sense but the gods probably can The problem with that theory being that as far as you know dath ilan doesnt have those Asmodia says

If you had a family that only threw daughters and one that only threw sons Tonia said theyd do about as well for themselves Id think Its not like throwing only sons is an advantage Men dont have more children than women on average since theyre having them with women The uh problem with my theory is I dont know maybe you could imagine it being two thirds to one third and still somehow working out so that no one had an advantage I dont know how you would prove you wouldnt

Why does it matter whether some family has an advantage What do the forces that created humans care about that

Tonia bites her lip I feel like it should but I dont have a good explanation when someones got an advantage then the situations not stable And if no one has an advantage then the situations stable

And if its not stable then it moves until it arrives somewhere stable only how is it moving here With national politics the way it moves is that other countries deliberately counterbalance ones that are growing With wars the way it moves is that the side thats more powerful wins But with babies its not that some people throw all girls and some people throw all boys where one would increase its numbers until it didnt have an advantage Instead everybody throws a mix thats just a confusion without even a theory

How they manage to know one thing around here but not another probably the concept of an equilibrium appeared in wizardry even though apparently wizards dont already know calculus At least at their level

Right Any time youve got pressures on something moving it itll keep moving for so long as the pressures arent balanced Half male and half female represents a balance of something which is why its like that but what is it thats balancing We have thoughts like well if it was ten times as many women as men or ten times as many men as women then a women who had all male children or all female children would have more grandchildren But that doesnt explain how its a pressure how it would be able to move the systems mix of men and women if that mix wasnt already one to one How can we get from in a country with ten times as many women as men one woman with all male children would have ten times as many grandchildren to there is a pressure that will move the average ratio of men and women if it isnt already 11

This takes them a while Theyre more willing to show confusion on their faces at least 

Eventually well say you throw only daughters and those daughters also throw only daughters and some other people throw only sons who also throw only sons no that doesnt work because theyd have to have children with each other 

No I think youre onto something Meritxell says I mean not in the case where some people only throw sons and some only throw daughters but in the case where some people mostly throw sons and some mostly throw daughters and pass that along then if you start out with mostly women the people who mostly throw sons will have more grandchildren until theres not more women anymore and they havent got an advantage Uh Im confused about how youd pass along a tendency to throw sons Im not sure you can do that

Youre on the right track Remember some things I told you earlier about tiny spirals inside people remember that those hidden orders are real and not just stories or at least they were definitely real in dath ilan and probably also here given that the food hasnt already killed me Inside every human body there are tiny spirals that code how a body works themselves divided into twenty three pairs of packages One of those package pairs is the sex package pair or chromosome pair in Baseline 

Keltham sketches out the sex chromosomes XY for male XX for female A child gets one chromosome in each chromosome pair from each parent allocated by the parent at random

But if you imagine a new genetic alternative mutation which influenced the ratio of sperm containing Y chromosomes or X chromosomes or a mutation in the mother which influenced whether male or female pre infants were kept and gestated that mutation wouldnt have to be a mutation in the sex chromosomes in particular A man could have sons that were more likely though not certain to have more other sons and even the daughters of those men might still have male children of their own that had more sons The force of possible heritable mutations that would throw a different mix is the pressure that only ever reaches a balancing point at one to one males to females

Or rather to be precise the balance is one to one parental investment in males and females If females were half the size of men and required half as much parental attention and grew two to a birth so that you could raise two females at the same cost as one male the balancing point would be two women per men you wouldnt be able to do better by birthing more men because men would be more expensive If you see an animal species that isnt half male and half female the first thing to ask is whether the males or females are bigger or smaller or fewer survive to adulthood or theres otherwise some big difference in how expensive they are to birth and raise to maturity

But theres a larger point and a more important one The balancing point isnt the point thats good for the species the country as a whole Its not the point you would pick if you were a supergod making the species from scratch If you were doing that as a supergod youd probably have ten times as many women as men and then just make it incredibly biologically difficult to ever birth all men try to design the people so that no mutation could possibly affect the balance of ten women per men More members of the species would be able to birth children Or to look at it from another angle you might also wonder whether a group or small faction birthing mostly women would have an advantage over a group with half men and half women if the mostly female group could grow faster because more of its members could bear children or because it didnt have to pay the extra cost in food of supporting men too But then a group like that would also be vulnerable to an invading mutation that birthed more men that mutation would rapidly spread within the group You can look at the sex ratio in humans half men and half women and say things like Oh I see that the balancing points between competing genes do not settle at the place that is good for groups having more children it settles in the places that are advantageous for individuals having more children

And then everything else you see inside a human should settle in a similar kind of place or it wont be stable against the pressure from mutated alternatives Thats why you want to prosper for yourself instead of being full of unselfish desire to see your whole country prosper Its why I need to offer you money to work for me instead of you just working for the benefit of Golarion or Cheliax A faction full of individuals all working for the common good would grow faster obtain more resources and have more kids and you might think a mutation which built people like that would soon take over the world But as soon as that faction was invaded by a mutation in an individual that worked for their own benefit that mutation would soon become more common it wouldnt be a stable balancing point in the sort of species that ends up with half males and half females Insect species like ants if you have those here which you probably do if theres a word for ants have lots of worker ants all laboring for the benefit of an ant hive they dont have equal investment in males and females Ants can be balanced in different places because ants reproduce differently and workers share more genes with their queens

I wouldnt be surprised if the event that you remember historically as humans gaining free will was the gods trying to modify people to work unselfishly for gods or maybe the gods factions like ants but over time mutations accumulated in the human population that made them resistant to that magical template and restored the old balancing points where people cared about themselves instead Or maybe the gods stopped doing it for some other reason I dont know Im new around here Oh and I should say the balancing points arent purely selfish You share half your genes with your parents half your genes with your children and an average of around half your genes with your brothers and sisters you have some instinct to help them though not quite as strongly as you wish to help yourself My point is that if you know how all the pieces of reality are woven together if you know the hidden orders and secret stories behind them you can take one glance at the statistics of women giving birth see that its half male children and half female children and guess I bet the people in this species mostly want pay for their work and dont mostly work unselfishly for the good of the group like ants I bet they care a lot about their brothers and sisters but not nearly so much about their second cousins The pressures on heredity in this species must balance at the point where individuals and small families cant easily get more grandchildren with a different strategy not at the point where larger groups cant get more grandchildren with a different strategy And I could similarly guess very quickly that you hadnt been put together from scratch by gods or supergods just from the way you acted so similar to dath ilani at a basic level because gods wouldnt be bound by those balancing points the same way

I should probably pause here and check whether you have any questions whether you followed all that and whether Im currently committing any visible horrible teaching errors that make a Chelish students life less pleasant

The students are captivated 

It fits with what weve learned in theology class Meritxell says About there being deep reasons Evil is a natural equilibrium though not usually phrased like that 

A balancing point of pressures Very large amounts of reality in general are at balancing points of pressures which is why that aspect of reality sticks around in that form its a very common maybe the most common form that a hidden order takes Water is a balancing point of pressures in a way Ill either explain for free or sell later if water wasnt balanced in its own dimensions of reality you wouldnt see so much of it around Rocks too theyre at balancing points among the possible ways that the stuff making up rocks could be instead of rocks Likewise just about everything in the human body or mind is at a local balancing point of how individuals and families can have the most grandchildren because if it wasnt even a small mutation could move you to a better point along that local dimension and then that mutation would propagate Like people wanting to have sex say where if they wanted less sex theyd have fewer kids and if they wanted even more sex right away theyd do things that arent productive in the long term and end up with fewer kids If your body made a bunch more blood or a bunch less blood that would on average lead to you having fewer kids too The degree to which people are Evil on average however gods define that exactly will also be at a balancing point relative to how many grandchildren families have when theyre around that Evil or if the world has recently been thrown into disequilibrium the average degree of Evil will be moving away from its previous point where people in the previous world had the most grandchildren if they were around that Evil This would be even easier to see if youd studied calculus by the way so when you do remember to go back and rethink this in terms of derivatives equaling zero at the point where things stick around in existence

They take notes vigorously 

Spells you can cast happen at balancing points in ways that magic can be someone volunteers If you try to design a spell that does a random thing you thought of thatd be nice to have a spell for itll blow up in your face and the reason is that you didnt happen to stumble on a way for magic to be where the magic will be happy to be with no nearby state itll flow into instead So the way to actually invent spells is to understand where magic flows and then find places its flowed into and then figure out what spell that must be

Im frankly a bit puzzled as to why wizards dont already know calculus and not just topology But maybe if spell design is hard enough to require specialized ultra expensive intelligence headbands and calculus is only useful once you get to that part well thats a topic for another time Keltham is going to be so amused if the actual key to spell design is on the order of invert the matrix to solve for the balancing point and they just dont know how to invert matrices but he is mostly not expecting this to be the case though the incredibly bad design of Chelish schools sure has bumped up its plausibility

Anyways uh now that Ive said all that and just to check has anyone had a sudden horrible realization about how mutations for lower Intelligence would be propagating or why only what this world calls average intelligence is the way for a family to have the most grandchildren or why the Chelish heritage optimization program is doing something horribly wrong around there I dont have anything specific in mind here I just uh it seems wise to check

Well probably we should be encouraging wizards more aggressively

Maybe itd make sense to not let stupid people have children

Wizards are also more likely to die I think and were in school for longer and deployed when we graduate I dont see how youd change that though you need all that school to get good and you need the deployment to pay Cheliax back and keep the Worldwound sealed 

You could encourage wizards to have kids before they deploy and their grandparents and the daycares raise them while theyre deployed I think its hard to be pregnant in school right now but if it was good for Cheliax they could change the things that make it hard

Theres well theres specific details I should probably be selling not just giving away But in general Ill observe that one corollary of this whole theory is that if youve got a really excellent female wizard and shes got a brother you can potentially subsidize the brother to have an extra six kids Its not as good as her having an extra six kids herself but it beats doing nothing Anything more clever and optimal and calculated than that is probably a sale issue rather than a free giveaway though Im still working out which is which on that score

I dont know enough details about Cheliaxs situation to know myself what an optimal policy should look like Ive given you some of the knowledge youd need to think about it but if Chelish governance is considering a policy shift based on that knowledge it is probably wise to run it past me too I dont know how to balance the intelligence of future generations against any need for immediate wizards being deployed at the Worldwound and yeah asking people to be pregnant in school is a large ask But if you are currently losing even more intelligence to that sort of leak in the gene pool I would really seriously consider that an emergency I would not personally have expected a stable society to be possible at this level of average intelligence and Im not sure how much further it stays possible

His audience is so captivated and concerned 

Youd think raising kids in Cheliax would be sufficient to make them not stunningly naive but apparently it isnt Elias Abarco mutters through the telepathic bond with his colleagues The girls are hanging off Kelthams every word with a degree of conviction that they ought to realize is borderline dangerous at best trying to figure out how everything else theyve been told is compatible with what theyre hearing now instead of keeping in mind that maybe Kelthams just not Asmodean and wont teach them to be either Or theyre very good liars Probably for at least some of them its the latter though its a very good presentation optimized for Elias rather than for Keltham who is definitely missing nearly all of its nuances 

Keltham wont teach them to be Asmodean Thats obvious Presumably part of what theyre here for is to figure out whether theres a variant of Kelthams teachings that will teach kids to be Asmodean the obvious intelligence and societal competence distilled differently presented in a way that preserves the awe inducing sense of thats what its like for the world to be designed around principles that youd have to be much smarter to even begin to understand while also preserving the stuff thatd ideally go with it a sense of smallness and irrelevance which dath ilan clearly does not bother inculcating 

Maybe some of the girls can be set to coming up with the synthesis once theyve been nailed down The plan is to get them tomorrow before dawn possibly excluding Sevar who might spend the night with Keltham and if so can be got at breakfast This isnt Asmodeanism but it does seem like theres a better crafted more compelling version of Asmodeanism buried in it once you strip out the stuff thats plainly aimed at advancing the art rather than awing children into submission with it

Ione Sala if somebody were to look inside her head which nobody of Chelish affiliation at least is doing exactly at this moment would not be smiling as much on the inside as she is on the outside She is thinking about how it really is beautiful that you could look at a species of half men and half women and deduce so many other things from that because you know why theyre half men and half women which is a huge thought she only understands a fraction of but it implies so many other things apparently And with that you can just get tossed into another plane even though nobody from your home plane knew for sure there were other planes and by the time youve been there two minutes you know which parts of the theology lessons are more there because theyre mandatory for Asmodeans to believe and which parts are the other kind of theology it doesnt do to be too precise about thoughts like that But you can end up in another plane you had no idea existed and within two minutes you know the people there werent originally created by the gods

Ione Sala isnt smiling as much on the inside because shes regretting a little that her life is like it is She does well on tests its why shes here that and being passably pretty She carefully doesnt compete too hard in social contests she aims to end up safely in the middle She behaves just as it is safest to behave towards the students above her and below her including sexual favors as they are given away to those below her who are useful or extracted from her by those above her She passes her loyalty scans by being a cautiously obedient game player even in her own mind a sort of person that Cheliax considers adequately standard and predictable a sort of soul that Asmodeus considers to be an acceptably tyrannized slave It is the way that things have always been and will always be If any parts of her feel otherwise they are not allowed to voice their heretical thoughts in words though she also knows wordlessly in the back of her mind that if shes a good enough wizard someday Cheliax will ask her to sell her soul and after that it will be okay to think more freely

Still some tiny remaining fraction of Ione Sala even today wishes without words or inner acknowledgment that her life could be more like the greater reality shes dimly glimpsed inside a repurposed library in an Archdukes villa learning things knowing how one fact connects to so many other facts seeing how worlds differ across planes

But now onward to the next part of this topic which may be personally important to some of those present Suppose hypothetically that Cheliax discovers an alien visitor who well guess for now to be capable of interbreeding with Golarion humans who is about as smart as the smartest Chelish people without intelligence headbands actually can somebody remind Keltham of what the mean intelligence is around here in the local measurements He thinks he was told this number but hes forgotten it since Also does this language have any more standard way to talk about the square root of the average squared deviation from the mean

Ten and no thats how youd talk about that though with intelligence in particular people usually talk about a two step which is the same thing an intelligence of 12

So around sixty eight percent of the population should have an Intelligence between 8 and 12 Is that about correct

Yep 

All right then the Chelish government has just come across an alien visitor with an Intelligence of Keltham thinks he was told 18 though at levels like these the difference between 175 and 185 is significant but lets say his Intelligence is exactly 18 for now Though it feels funny to call himself Intelligence 18 since in dath ilans system the average g is 0 and Keltham is at 08 Somebody with a dath ilani g of 18 would have a dath ilani Intelligence of 46 But lets ignore for now how the dath ilani system is obviously better and closer to the underlying math

So anyways Is this alien visitor likely to be of any special benefit to heredity optimization in Cheliax and Golarion compared with just matching the same potential volunteers with a local man of Intelligence 18 Is he worth anything special from the Chelish governments standpoint

Pretend you were just collectively tapped to advise the Chelish government on this and cant ask Keltham directly Also try to pretend that youre a dath ilani whose life experience trains them to continue thinking in the face of questions your teachers didnt tell you how to answer including the part where you know and list the reasons you might be wrong

 well probably its easier to get girls to sleep with Keltham since hes cooler than their average male classmate If thats wrong its wrong because well you could just order them you could just pay them more

So says Tonia if someone reads 18 and their relatives also read 18 theyre more valuable than someone who reads 18 and their relatives are more like 14 because the score doesnt map perfectly to the thing we actually care about though its pretty good and someone who is an outlier is also likelier to be sort of a measurement error a case where theyre not actually quite as bright as their number suggests but if their familys that smart too then they probably just are 

And similarly if someones from a society where the average is 18 Asmodia says Its a realer 18 in a manner of speaking uh if thats wrong itd be because maybe the measurement system is actually meant to evaluate locals and fails on evaluating foreigners 

dath ilan is richer than us Everyone eats better We know that kids who dont eat enough are stupider Maybe none of us eat enough and were all stupider than our children would be if they were raised in dath ilan and so Keltham has less good heritable traits than us but a much better upbringing

Sure but wizard kids are mostly born to wizards and dont go hungry

We dont go hungry compared to normal people we might still be missing something or replace hunger with malaria does dath ilan have malaria 

Doesnt translate so if its there its not common enough to have a name I learned either that or this translation magic is picky about what it translates in ways I dont understand I know the theory of several things that will knock half a will knock a point off of Intelligence if youre deficient on them thats specific knowledge rather than basic general principles but the Chelish government should maybe purchase that knowledge from me sometime soon Im happy to sell it on a contingency contract where its only worth any payment if you run experiments and find later that kids were actually deficient Element 53 is in seaweed They need to see what happens if kids here grow up eating seaweed

Also credit for thinking of that at all I should have remembered earlier that intelligence here may not be as heritable as it is where I come from because weve eliminated the variation from non heritable factors like that There are also potential contaminants that can knock off a point of Intelligence or do other kinds of metabolic damage Element 82 Element 3 You should contingency buy my knowledge about that too Or would healing spells fix that already

Thats not the kind of thing that healing fixes Restoration might but your average person who isnt an adventurer has never gotten a Restoration it costs uh three or four years of unskilled labor

Theres a very obvious thing a dath ilani thinks immediately after hearing that Can you guess what it is

 that its worth it

Whats worth it depends on what you can afford Do you even have that many clerics who can cast spells from a high enough circle to get your whole population that way Its not the first thing a dath ilani thinks either Try again

 that we should at least check

Check what How

Try a Restoration on a number of random farmers that we can afford and check if their intelligence goes up afterwards If you tried it on five of them and it didnt do anything for any of them then its probably not a big deal at least

Why yes that is indeed something that this advisory panel might tell the Chelish government to do in order to help estimate the probable value of the alien visitor to their heritage optimization program and also you know check on general principles if there is anything that might be lowering your entire populations intelligence Since you figured that out on your own from being told the basics I will not charge for that advice in that form though there are some further refinements for sale if you would like your results to be more precise and more meaningful The other thing to keep in mind is that intelligence develops over time even if Restoration immediately fixes nutrient deficiencies or subtle contaminants it may not fix the way that intelligence already developed as a result of those nutrient deficiencies or subtle contaminants So the other thing a dath ilani thinks of immediately is to try giving some children a Restoration once every three months and seeing if on average those children grow up with higher measured Intelligence than would be predicted from the measured Intelligence of their parents There are precise subtleties we think of in the design of the investigation procedure like having any control group at all and any grasp of quantitative statistics and the required number of experimental subjects to produce enough expected evidence between possible effect sizes though I havent yet decided if those are for sale or free There are also ways we think of to start getting preliminary results faster earlier saving on time like experiments on rats followed by experiments on monkeys who have shorter development times and arent protected by sapient rights the same way as chimpanzees or humans But again I havent decided if specifics like that are free and they probably arent

And then if tests like that show an effect of routine Restoration on intelligence development you know that the general population has any kind of significant problem that Restoration cures and you can start trying to narrow down what the problem is and how to cure it without needing to spend precious cleric spells on Restorationing every member of the population

The larger attitude I want to teach you is that everything around you is an investigative tool Theres a famous dath ilani fictional character who spent too much time fighting and now thinks in terms of how every object in a room could be used as a weapon This is that but for figuring things out Your first thought was that since Restoration cured people maybe you could use it to solve your problem and cure everybody in the Chelish population Before solving problems comes figuring out problems and the first step there is to open your eyes and look Everything around you is a tool for investigation it is a potential way to poke other things and reveal facts about them Restoration isnt just a way of curing people of a set of problems its an investigation tool for seeing whether observable qualities of people are being affected by things that Restoration cures First open your eyes and look and ask how every resource you have and everything in the world around you can be an eye

Ione Sala has never deliberately tried to learn anything more about Nethys or any other gods who arent Asmodeus why run even a slightly increased chance of seeming heretical but even she knows that this is the most Nethys thing that has been said inside the borders of Cheliax since the change of administration She wonders if this was enough to catch Nethyss attention and if Nethys is now looking at this very library and will try to well no Nethys cant make Keltham a cleric Kelthams already some other gods cleric

But let us return to this advisory board and its report to the Chelish government on the potential value of the alien visitor The board has recommended some experiments that might shed light on the general state of the entire Chelish gene pool which perhaps should have been done already assuming they havent been Chelish Governance does seem to contain some smart people and Lawful beings but if not the alien visitor can sell some further refinements in those regards Anyways leave that part aside How is the advisory board thinking about the basic question of whether its especially useful to set up matches with an alien with 18 Intelligence Is it more useful than a match with an 18 Intelligence local Why or why not What are the different theories there what is there to say for and against those theories

It depends on which produces smarter children and grandchildren Presumably the government already has some sense of how valuable it is to them to have people of a given intelligence so if you know which match produces smarter children and grandchildren and by how much you know how valuable it is

You could maybe Tonia ventures compare marriages between Chelish INT 18 people to a marriage to say a Tian INT 18 person and if marrying out produces smarter or stupider offspring it ought to show up in that

An interesting thought Especially since if marriages like that already exist you could go look at those marriages already without needing to wait years to produce your advisory report But before you look at a result like that you should try to come up with some prior idea of which ways reality could be that could produce which results What are the different things that might be true What different results would they produce for Chelish Tian marriages

Well people hybridize with some other humanoid species by getting traits from both and hybridize with some species by getting traits from just one and hybridize with some by not turning out at all So it might be true that hybridization across ethnicities is like that where you get a mix or you might get something thats not quite in between like you get if you fuck a polymorphed air elemental the kid isnt half air theyre just something else entirely Youd be checking to see how people hybridize more or less

I can tell you the result of that one if a Chelish Tian mating is a human one and the human matings work anything like they do in dath ilan Twenty three package pairs of heritable information remember with each child getting their two packages one from each parent package pair selected at random So most things in a human mating will be a mix unless a trait is being determined all at once in a single package pair location the way that sex is determined by the sex package pair Intelligence is not determined all in one spot if its determined here anything at all like it is in dath ilan Therell be bits of heritage all over the twenty three package pairs that affect it positively negatively and subtly

Well and now that Ive told you that is there still anything you could find out from observing Chelish Tian matings What could you observe differently where youre not already sure of what you might observe What could those possible observations say about the package pairs and the heritable information coding for Intelligence What could it be saying about whats going on inside of those package pairs in Cheliax in Tian and in your guesses extrapolated from distant Tian to the far more distant dath ilan

 variance says Meritxell If you mix two eighteens you probably get an eighteen on average but but its much more valuable to get a sixteen and a twenty than two eighteens because the twenty can end up running the country if Chelish people and Tian people have the same bits making them smarter then theyll have the same variance mixed but if they have different bits then theyll have higher variance

You have slightly impressed me Be justly proud of this

She beams at him fiercely

Oh good After he said that Keltham started to worry that some dath ilani flirting tropes wouldnt make it across the vast cultural gap but at least that one seems to have landed

Now heres a harder question How valuable is higher variance in the intelligence of offspring if the alien visitor has mostly different bits in his package pairs that increase and decrease intelligence How much can the Chelish government gain from using that variance how much should they be willing to pay

Well depends how valuable smart people are But I think I mean one person with native born INT 20 is itself something theyd pay a lot for and the variance thing probably applies for a couple generations until its all diluted 

Hm yes how much youre willing to pay for one Intelligence 20 offspring does depend on what use you can make of them which in turn depends on how clever you are in thinking up potential uses This advisory panel of the greatest native experts in Cheliax on heritage optimization has been convened to make expert recommendations about heritage optimization to the Chelish government since that is what this advisory panel knows more about than anybody else in Cheliax or Golarion for that matter This may now actually be true about you in real life by the way Anyhow the rest of Governance will decide for itself how valuable an Intelligence 20 person will be for purposes of fighting at the Worldwound and such What can this advisory panel say to Governance or wildly guess with appropriate qualifiers about the clever use of any Intelligence 20 children from the alien for the purposes of heritage optimization in particular

 you probably shouldnt pair them off with their half siblings you get weird genetic defects that way and there arent any native twenties that Ive ever heard of 

And now I know you actually do have the package pair system around here The pairs of packages carry duplicates of a lot of the same genetic information for constructing a person that is if a package is carrying some of the instructions for building like fingers youve got the same information on both packages in the pair usually If one of the package pairs gets damaged in that particular the other element of the pair can often take over and make sure your fingers still get built If a brother and a sister mate their offspring has a one fourth probability of ending up with the same package twice for each of the twenty three pairs You are a lot more likely to end up with no information for building fingers that way In dath ilan the corresponding equilibrium is that people usually arent sexually attracted to other people they grew up with If people here werent also built from package pairs they wouldnt get the same deleterious effects from mating with half siblings

Anyways yes you shouldnt pair off my kids with each other in the first or second generations unless youve already developed other magic or technology for telling who got which packages from me Still what are they worth to the Chelish government Ignore the part for the moment about whether any of my kids are smarter than any other kids in this world they may not be for reasons Ill get into thats a fighting at the Worldwound issue anyways How would you guess the value of intelligence variance for the heritage optimization program or the value of having different bits of heritage that are increasing and lowering intelligence

They are pretty stumped by this You could have smarter kids but thats been said already You cant directly try to use the best bits because they have no magic that refers to things on the level of bits

Its not occurring to them that they could just Ah what kind of intelligence training games you dont have a word for them thats not a good sign what kind of complicated games do Chelish children play if any at all

People play Knights which is a two player board game with pieces that move in different ways and Spy which is a group game where some children are spies and some are soldiers and they have to figure out whos sabotaging their operations and it takes them a suggestive while to come up with a third though someone eventually offers that there are spelling bees

HOW DOES EVERYTHING MANAGE TO BE THIS BROKEN SIMULTANEOUSLY WOULDNT THE KIDS THEMSELVES SPONTANEOUSLY INVENT BETTER GAMES THAN 

Right then what we are going to do now is invent a new reality mirroring game That is one of the things that a dath ilani child would do as a matter of course faced with a question they had no idea how to answer whether that question came from an older child or a Watcher or from life itself they would try to invent a game corresponding to the question that they might learn something from playing

There is math that I know which describes in a quite simple way the value of variance for heritage optimization as it happens or the result of having the variations come from different bits of heritage But it can be hard to correctly derive the math that will give you the fully general answer right away Inventing games can be straightforward in a way that doing math is not

I did tell you how the twenty three package pairs work So why not invent a game with say four package pairs and four places in each package where heritages can potentially vary How would you make a game like that and play it to learn something about how heritage optimization might play out As an advisory panel to the Chelish government it may be worth your time to spend a whole day playing games like that if thats where youre generating your ideas and advice in fact you might even hire other people to play them for you and report back about the results Though here you cant do that yet even if you brought in somebody else to hire in real life because youre still learning how to invent and play relevant games at all

They set at this Somewhat abashedly everyone has four package pairs and four places where heritages can potentially vary and each spot can either be a smart or a nothing or a dumb and your score is the smarts minus the dumbs Everyone can trade with other people and you can drop the current person youre playing for any of your offspring and other people tell you their total score but not any components and you try to have the smartest person after twenty rounds

Would that be the right kind of game

Play it once and see what happens

They try it Its not clear anyone is having any fun but they work very effortfully at it Mostly everyone tries to do all of their trades with the highest scoring person around who has no real incentive to trade with dumb people This is probably reflective of life but its not very fun

This game is not even slightly reflective of how anything would plausibly work in reality and nobody has any idea of how fun game design or accurate simulation game design works and they are playing a game that would be cooperative in real life as if it is a competitive one and it is occurring to Keltham for the first time that they may not even consciously know the difference between positive sum and zero sum games which sure would explain why simple words for that dont seem to exist in Taldane or why no Chelish book or Chelish person has ever happened to use the terms around him yet

Right This is fine Everything is fine

All right lets stop there Keltham says trying to maintain the same calm demeanor that a Watcher would have in this situation I think this game isnt playing out the same way it would play out if Chelish governance was running a heritage optimization program do you have any ideas what went wrong and how you should modify the game

They noticed some problems

 high intelligence people cant get much out of trading whereas in real life people are pretty motivated to have sex even if they dont get smart children out of it

 you can only be one person so you have to ditch the person you were if you want to be a new person but maybe you should just get to add them to your stable thatd incentivize having more children though also the paperwork would get really annoying

 no one has any particular insight into how some people got better it seems like mostly just luck

I am genuinely not sure how to introduce this topic if you have never encountered it before but sometimes in real life a group of people have to work towards a common goal and at the end get some payout in common that they have to divide up according to previously agreed upon rules if they were smart Games can work like that too and should if theyre trying to mirror that kind of reality Chelish Governance is going to be trying to make the game work like that thats sort of the whole point of having a government in the first place

The other thing thats missing is that you dont seem to have a current notion of what youre trying to find out from the game you know I think I may be doing this wrong and not providing you with enough direction literally the first time youre doing this You play games with older kids leading before you get handed some problem that requires you to invent a game for younger kids to play with you Well I may just be motivated to think that because of my personal interest in having this particular topic taught quickly still the rationalization seems valid after having been invented

So Things you could be testing in this game include alternate rules that Chelish governance could give the players about subsidies and rewards which would lead players each trying to maximize their own score to do useful things for heritage optimization And now its occurring to me that maybe you dont already have this concept maybe people here just make up laws that sound like good ideas and dont play games to figure out what the laws will do in their effects on selfish people In which case I also have to at some point convey basic competence for figuring out what effects different legal systems would have and optimizing better laws which the complete wreckage of what my own people consider Lawfulness in Golarion should maybe have suggested to me earlier was also going to end up a Project issue but never mind one thing at a time

The other thing you were going to investigate was the effect of adding one person with different bits of heritage to the system So for now just make up some fixed rules about points that players score by having smarter characters in their hand lets say theres at most three characters you can keep in your hand at one time and your objective is not to score higher than other players its just to score as many points as possible for yourself Characters can be male or female at random men can have any number of children in a lifetime women can have only three children per lifetime When any two players mate their characters they have to agree in advance on which player will retain the resulting offspring Any time a mating occurs between two characters one of whom has over ten smarts the Chelish government pays an extra point to whichever player doesnt end up owning the resulting offspring Any time a mating occurs between two characters both with over ten smarts the Chelish government pays an extra three points to whichever player doesnt end up owning the resulting offspring At the end of the game everybody gets a bonus equal to total smarts divided by ten which mirrors the real life fact that smart people dont capture all of the value they create for themselves and that smarter societies end up generally richer even for the nonsmart people in them and remember your in game goal is to maximize your total points for yourself not worry at all about how many points other players are scoring Keltham goes on sketching some additional rules intended to make the game mirror real life genetics and real life incentives under conditions of government subsidy

Each player gets one free mating at the start of the game with the Thamkel character which is the only one that has any smart or dumb values at the fourth locus of each chromosome all other characters have neutral at the fourth locus Thamkel also has only neutral values at the first locus where other characters can have smart or dumb there This reflects the way that Thamkel has some different varying bits You cant legally mate two Thamkel offspring during the first two generations afterwards There are a few other characters as smart as Thamkel but only Thamkel has any variation in the fourth locus for each chromosome

And then Keltham observes what happens under the new game conditions Do they sort of get the point of the simulation now or the incentives At all

Yes once he spells it out they can follow how thats like the situation theyre trying to produce and they can try to fumble through it with all the new scoring rules in mind Theyre still not clear on how you learn from this how much Thamkel helps aside from playing the game without Thamkel in it

Well yes after theyve played this game for a few generations theyre going to score themselves and then play a new game without Thamkel in it

Right 

Theyre still evidently not having any fun but they do this very diligently and get better at it over a couple of trials and take down their scores They seem to find it hard not to track who has the highest score 

Hes seriously not trying to score them on their game scores First of all people were given randomized characters with uneven qualities at the start of the game just like life itself isnt fair in that way and second hes watching to see if people play according to their incentives not whether they get higher scores than other players

 hes not sure whats going wrong with the way that nobodys having fun Maybe just the sheer cognitive load associated with not really instinctively feeling whats going on and not having pre learned brain patterns for this complicated game He should maybe back off of this soon then and only re approach after playing simple games with shorter term intrinsic real rewards associated with good play like if theyre doing it on a playground or the adult equivalent of that He doesnt want to train his students that simulation games arent fun

So this game wasnt a very realistic one for example you knew all of your characters genetic information locus by locus where for a more realistic game we shouldve had some Game Masters who only told you a characters total Intelligence score didnt tell you anything about the specific loci and generated new characters for everyone after each mating Nonetheless for this unrealistic version around how valuable was Thamkel

Two games without Thamkel managed to take Intelligence from 10 to 122 and 128 over the prescribed number of generations Two games with Thamkel took Intelligence to 136 and 128 Its frustrating how slowly the game seems to progress

But still that suggests Thamkel is maybe worth a point over the next couple of centuries which is a lot if it were true on a population scale

Unfortunately I cant promise this scenario is at all realistic The results you got were ones that I knew youd get the game simplified things to where more or less the main thing driving the results was how much variance squared deviation you had to select on The games with Thamkel gave you four thirds as much variation to work with as the games without him and thats basically the answer you got That said though the game was simplified that part should be more or less true about real genetics according to the real math the real math says that the rate of selection on a characteristic goes as the covariance between the variance of that characteristic and variance in fitness

I could have just proved that but I thought it was more important to show you a methodology that works for getting a quick perspective on modeling something in an hour when you dont know how to prove a general mathematical result inside that hour Even the abstract math wouldnt take into account things like the division of the genes into twenty three package pairs and until we played this game with four package pairs it would be hard to tell from looking at the more abstract path whether that was a critical thing to model

Is it realistic that the game with Thamkel has four thirds as much variation to select on Thats the critical question and unfortunately that part I dont know I wish I could remember what percentage of population variance an average dath ilani is carrying or figure out how many alternative alleles besides that would have been fixed in your population versus my population over the unknown time since dath ilan diverged from whatever human biology got here With my own worlds technology we could spot check the tiny spirals directly see how different they were figure out how much theyd diverged and get a good guess how long ago it had happened chronologically But I cant do that and I dont remember even some of the relevant figures that Ive actually seen

The end result could be anywhere between Keltham is worth a five percent boost to how much heritage optimization we can get over a millennium to Keltham has most of a whole other planes worth of intelligence promoting alleles that differ from our own pool and that gives us twice as many beneficial mutations to work with or even though this would be extreme Keltham quadruples the amount of variance we have to work with because the cumulative differences between his plane and our plane are four times larger than the pool of important mutations we were selecting on locally and selection starts going four times as fast for a while a hundred years later

But lets be real here unless Im somehow worth much less than I look on the surface of the game the Chelish government cannot realistically pay me as much as my genes are worth to Golarion a thousand years later And also lets be real I didnt exactly do all the work of dath ilan that selected people like me into existence even if my genes would usually be considered to be owned by myself the percentage of generated value that I capture should maybe be legitimately less than if I was selling a book I wrote So this is mostly a situation of eh make me an offer for some unknown size but probably civilization level long term boost Plus maybe some unusually smart kids in the first generation if a lucky draw from the higher variance heritage bits that go into a Chelish woman with high Intelligence play well with half of a dath ilani baseline

Though I suspect the first generations results may possibly see a drop instead unfortunately if it breaks up some package combinations of established dath ilani genes that rely on each other Or if my kids dont get the right nutrition or if other kids start getting the right nutrition and catch up Youre not paying for a higher mean in the first generation than you couldve gotten with an 18 Intelligence person from Tian youre mainly paying for higher variance between smart kids over the next decades centuries and millennia Which is a lot more valuable than you might realize without doing the math or playing the game If the end result is that you get all of another worlds good ideas from its tiny spirals it really is quite valuable but most of the value wont show up in the very first generation of remixing the package pairs

Whats a fair value on that between friendly trade partners in a world otherwise dancing on the edge of imminent destruction by the Worldwound Good question really Unless your government tries to lowball the offer by an amount I consider insulting or silly I doubt thats going to end up the real sticking point I suspect a larger cause for hesitation is that I find myself selfishly concerned with what sort of life my kids will lead including the ones who only end up with Intelligence sixteen or even fourteen if thats how much variance is in play and the first generation ends up breaking important combinations inside the dath ilani baseline genome I mean the kids whod otherwise exist instead of my kids wouldnt be hugely better off unless youd otherwise have found mates much smarter than me so all fine from a Good perspective But Im not Good and I know very little about this place and it is kind of a gigantic flaming mess and theyd be my kids well thats the sticking point from my own perspective

But anyways I have now conveyed to you and so hopefully to Chelish Governance soon after that basic knowledge of realitys underlying workings which is required to guess a valuation over the genes from an alien traveler with 18 Intelligence including the elements of great uncertainty in models thereof I await your governments offer and perhaps more importantly testable predictions over my offsprings future circumstances

 nervous giggles 

 what about their circumstances do you want predictions about exactly That theyll get a good education That theyll uh consider themselves to have been done a favor by your creating them

 I frankly have not thought about this enough I thought I had several more years at least to think about it and when I contemplated it before did not expect this quantity of potential variation from baseline circumstances I would need to consider My kids considering me to have done them a favor by becoming their dad would be would be a start But also am I going to scream in horror every time I try to check in on one of my 144 kids and theyre being taught how to do arithmetic incorrectly in school and should I even let that stop me or is it just the kind of thing that somebody has to grit their teeth and accept if Golarion is ever going to be less of a giant flaming mess The prospect of having 144 kids here would be less of a funawful question if this place was less of a giant flaming mess Should I maybe at least wait until two successive waking hours have gone by without my realizing once again that in fact things in Golarion are much worse than I previously realized This at minimum would seem to indicate some basic level of achieved epistemic stability that seems valuable for making irrevocable long term decisions

My feelings about this are a bit disordered and Im not going to try to sort them out in two minutes I can tell I wont end up with a great answer if I do that

Theres a silence long enough it could be considered awkward

Golarions probably going to be a whole lot better in ten years anyway you can stall on this one for as long as you can bear to

Yeah heres another bit of knowledge Ill throw it in for free The little tiny spirals arent perfectly stable they degrade little by little over time thats part of the story behind how getting old kills you The tiny spirals in female and male reproductive elements are some of the most protected and best repaired in the whole body but parents getting old before reproducing is still not good for kids If a man does something really impressive at 50 people try to have his kids kids not that guys kids directly 

Unless magical healing or Restoration repairs that Thats something we can also check by measuring the childrens intelligence from existing marriages between people who have or havent had Restorations Though it also implies that adventurers should age more slowly so if thats not already known to be true maybe dont bother

But even if that is true Im not going to take ten shitting years to decide a thing A ten year delay is not a trivial cost to heritage optimization in Cheliax and Golarion Im not slow like a tiny cognitive snail Im going to have any idea how Golarion works before ten years pass Ill see how fast its improving When I try to predict my own future decision my first order intuition is 70 that I say yes and that means my real probability is more like 95 given the known direction of systemic error there Delaying ten years on something youre 95 likely to do eventually is downright stupid But spotting myself ten days that I may perhaps do

Adventurers age mostly normally wizards worth their salt cast daily aging delaying spells and make one thirty one fifty I have no idea if their later in life children tend stupider

Wizarding school is disproportionately firstborns though everyone knows that Moreso in other countries where it might just be parental investment but even here Jacme says

Does that mean people should mostly have children in school for that reason Meritxell says or is the difference between your teens and twenties not as large 

Twenties is considered socially fine default childbearing years youd only push it into your teens or thirties if you were planning to have lots of kids and your twenties werent enough Thats what our customs were but I dont remember what the numbers are on that you know as much as we train to operate under ignorance its really quite alarming not to be able to look certain things up on on the repository of all human knowledge that every dath ilani can instantly access from their house Uh thats high on the tech ladder and youre not going to be able to do that for a while

 how do you set that up

Same tech that Id use to talk to somebody on the other side of the planet Or get the statistics from a million runs of a game like the one we just played without anybody playing it Tools to make tools to make tools hidden orders beneath hidden orders beneath hidden orders if it was simple youd have figured out more of it by now on your own The tech ladder goes up You go look for bits and pieces of reality that can interact with each other from far away you look for bits and pieces that you can arrange and rearrange into incredibly complicated dynamic patterns using advanced tools and you take your books and turn them into patterns like that and let them interact with other people from far away If it wasnt for magic maybe being able to boost things in ways we couldnt do in dath ilan Id say that there was little chance wed live to see it ourselves not as mortals maybe from the afterlife With magic anything is possible so far as I know you of course may know better

Well need headbands says Merixtell very dryly

Keltham is not really the intended audience of that statement 

Also Meritxell must be really convinced its worth getting in trouble for it because there arent a lot of continuations of the conversation that dont involve nailing down how much theyre supposedly all being paid

Carissa respects the initiative honestly

Legit I should maybe prioritize learning about those more than Ive been prioritizing that previously within my incredibly rapidly lengthening long list of priorities How much social credit do I need with Chelish Governance to start getting headbands for everyone for that matter What does it take to impress them A direct price list for what it takes to rent stuff by the day would come in handy For that matter Ive got fourth circle cleric spells I can potentially sell resorting to that seems like it would reflect a process inefficiency but its sometimes okay to do inefficient things temporarily

I think its plausible today was enough theyll loan you all the cheapest kind of headbands which do two points the expensive kind is four times that and does four points and the most expensive time is four times that again and does six I suspect the Chelish government does not have twenty or even three of the most expensive kind theyd be requisitioning from adventurers and thats much more expensive than the materials price

I suppose if that wasnt true Golarion would look different from how it does theres one metal spellsilver thats the limiting resource I would have memorized a lot more about the properties of every known kind of elemental metal and how to mine them all most efficiently if Id known this was how my life would go Its unfortunately exactly the sort of knowledge most people such as me are too lazy to memorize if you have access to the universal repository But with any luck climbing the tech ladder on generating heat and turning heat into motion will suffice for moving and sifting greater quantities of any kind of ore

Spellsilver and enchanter time but the sale price is sixty percent just the price of the raw materials and if that were cheaper in the long run more wizards would train into enchanting wondrous items

And with more headbands even basic headbands we get more wizards who can train to make more expensive headbands When things go well thats why they go well in economies

We should probably break soon for the day after which I should take a brain cooldown rest and then try studying basic wizard magic I think Though before then I did have a couple of things left to say about the optimization of hereditary information and some of those points are cautionary and shouldnt be left off

What would you need to caution people about thats a fraction as bad as accidentally making your whole population stupider because only smart people can learn Alter Self

Theyre starting to trust Keltham to know where hes going though They listen

Ill start with a probing sort of question though if everyones too tired I can step back from probing questions On the other hand if only some of you are too tired that part can continue Ill see if I get sensible answers I guess Anyhow Optimizing your whole population gene pool is obviously not something youd want to make mistakes with How could you gain more knowledge about what you were doing in advance of doing anything risky

 do it with part of your population One duchy not the whole country

Better than doing it with the whole country possibly But heritage optimization takes time Every time you try something and see what happens you have to wait one human generation to see what happens and if you need two generations well that adds up very quickly Gonna keep the whole country waiting while you play around in that one duchy Doing nothing also has risks

Speed of discovery matters Its not enough to get there eventually How can you figure out what the ass youre doing with heritage optimization without spending twenty years every time you want to try something How can you learn about the sort of mistakes that only show up three generations later in less than sixty years

 do it with mice

 do it in a time dilated demiplane

 ask Asmodeus

Yeah you got some resources we dont got in dath ilan I assume that time dilated demiplanes are very expensive but I nonetheless cant help but ask how much we have to prove ourselves before we get to tuck ourselves into one of those and do the rest of this faster

The nearest known permanent one is in Nex on another continent and I dont think its listed for rent though maybe they have a price It wouldnt be very surprising if we had a secret one for emergencies but its probably tiny if so theyre cheaper if theyre tiny and the Queen has a necklace of adaptation so she wouldnt need it to have air if theres one just for her and Lrilatha

Well not step one then But you really might end up with some very nice things in a very short time if you can scale the technology and magic to where you can get a decent sized research team into a time dilated demiplane

But I digress In dath ilan sure you could use mice But why limit your ambitions to just playing around with mice Humans arent the only sort of biological organisms with useful heritages

This puzzles them orcs have a faster generation time than humans and are more like us than mice someone offers

Good case for starting with an orc duchy if theres one around here but remember that Ive been telling you the secrets of life itself in general Do you use life for anything around here

Corn says Tonia It grows every year and we do select it a lot for not getting weevils and having big ears

Yep Corns got two packages per package tuple the same as humans if I recall though not twenty three package tuples I dont recall the exact number Wheat if youve got that here which I expect you do because the word translated if its the same wheat I know at least has six packages per package tuple If youve been selecting plants at all and the people whove been selecting them have already made any effort to try things systematically and observe results theres a whole body of knowledge there that you might be able to apply to heritage optimization in general And if they havent been trying things systematically and observing results then thats the art youre here to learn and whatever wonderful theories and strategies you come up with why maybe you could try them faster and cheaper on a field of corn than on a duchy

Theyre systematic Tonia says Probably not the way people are in dath ilan but they know what kinds do well with what weather and how they all hybridize and they track yield per acre and they trade tips and particularly good strains

Heh thats an example of the good news bad news duality right there Its no doubt been good for Cheliax that they already know that much but bad news that theyll have already tried a lot of obvious stuff which makes it harder for us to stroll in and double corn yields on our first try Are there specialists who make particularly good strains or do people just trade them as they randomly crop up

I dont think theres a way to make them besides planting historically good strains and seeing how they do Not that I heard of anyway

Well if theyre already doing the obvious I think the steps beyond that are knowledge for sale not universal basics Still should probably get a book on that

But if we got that book and after reading it the notion of the tiny spirals and the package tuples gave you some idea that you thought people probably hadnt tried yet well What sort of precautions should you take when trying to create new strains of corn using a clever new method nobodys tried before Because in real life on really novel problems theres no teacher telling you which precautions you need to take or correcting you if you miss one

 pray for guidance I know thats not what youre going for but its actually the front line intervention for unexpected consequences really 

Maybe Asmodeus is sick of saving us from mistakes we could catch ourselves

Starting small like with one duchy except maybe even smaller one cornfield

Checking the corn for poison to make sure you didnt make it worse somehow

Feed the corn to mice before you fed it to humans sure But then besides asking What precautions should I take one should perhaps first ask What exactly could go wrong in the first place What could potentially go wrong with trying to create a new strain of corn How could there be a disaster not just a minor stumble from trying to create a new strain of corn

Otolmens wishes she had not been REMINDED of that Those were not GOOD TIMES

This is a question Chelish wizards are spectacularly good at answering 

It happens to be really good for a certain kind of pest and they grow to ten times their usual size and eat everyone in the village

It smells irresistible to dragons

It angers the fae

Its so much more fertile than all other corn that it gets carried away on the wind and grows everywhere blotting out all other life until nothing grows anywhere on the continent but corn

Its great for a couple years but its sucking all the vitality out of the soil and leaves only sand behind

It lures maneating rats from the Underdark and then the infestation is impossible to root out

It grows six hundred feet in height and angers the aerial dragons

Locusts that lay their eggs in it have an unnaturally high survival rate and so instead of occasional clouds of locusts we have constant clouds of locusts and they blot out the sun

Its addictive and once youve eaten it you cant eat anything else

It disrupts the flow of magical energies through the land beneath its roots and remaps all the ley lines in Cheliax which causes a bunch of adjustment hurricanes and strands half the towns on the royal line

It develops impossible geometry the kind where looking at it gives you a headache and anyone who wanders into the field come harvest time is lost forever

It requires so much water that it sucks up water for hundreds of miles around turning half of central Cheliax to desert

Its actually just mediocre corn but with mind control to make you think its really great corn and were convinced we succeeded and plant it everywhere at which point its powerful enough to enslave the whole country

The little mortals really have NO idea do they

Does that sort of thing happen a lot around here 

 I mean those would be unusually bad outcomes

Usually interactions between the natural world and surrounding magical geography are fairly bounded theres only a couple documented incidents of ley lines moving because of ecological changes alone

Something going horribly wrong with pests is pretty likely but thats what adventurers make a living handling

Plants are the category of living thing least likely to spontaneously develop spell like abilities or sapience there are only about a hundred known kinds that have

No one has the slightest idea what angers the fae planting a new corn crop might but not planting a new corn crop might too

And if the dragons are mad theyll probably tell us burn some villages first but then tell us

I am suddenly concerned about whether I have accidentally fallen into the trap of thinking I am a story protagonist instead of applying the principle of mediocrity When I landed near the Worldwound was I otherwise improbably being placed near the most important present disaster in the world or actually is most of Golarion like that outside the protected housing and the Worldwound was just number twelve on the list of worst disasters from the previous week

Kelthams first order uncorrected intuitive probability hell want to have kids here has now fallen to 65 not so much from this update about Golarions nature per se as what it implies about a predictable string of first order updates that have all been in the same direction so far

 I think the Worldwound is a reasonable candidate for the worst problem in the world Meritxell says There are a few other planar rifts but theyre much smaller Cheliax has most of our military deployed at the Worldwound we wouldnt do that if there were ten things as likely as it to destroy the world But there are a lot of places that are horrible on a scale that wont destroy the world

Well at least thats a slightly pleasant surprise about how nice a place Golarion is to live compared to where Id just sent my second order estimate

Keltham genuinely is relieved about this to be repeatedly surprised by the same observation indicates that the machinery making up yourself is not properly reflecting the idea of surprise A stable meta rule no matter how bad you imagine Golarion is it is actually worse implies some defect in you and not just the planet

A lot of people it has occurred to Carissa think Cheliax is the worst problem in the entire world Thats because theyre dumb and get really worked up about a little bit of torture though

So if this was dath ilan Id know how probable or in a sense typical the disasters you named actually were but I have very little sense of that here Being able to imagine disasters at all is step one Being able to refine your sense of which disasters are actually likely to hit you is step two Then usually after that you need a step three where people realize that even if they dont like a disaster and start hurling insults at it about it being super incredibly improbable theres a difference between the kind of disaster that ignores insults like that and gets you anyways versus the kind of disaster that really actually goes against the character of reality and almost certainly wont happen I cannot guide you through developing that sense for probabilities using realistic examples because I am realizing I havent a butts notion of where any of what you said falls on that spectrum

But if you have a sense of something like what is a typical disaster for Golarion that might happen to you personally while breeding a new crop versus things that happen often enough that you hear about them but rarely enough that they havent happened to you or anyone you know versus possibilities that cant really get at you From a selfish perspective people are mainly incentivized to guard against common disasters that hurt themselves if you look at it from the perspective of Chelish Governance its their job to make sure anyone whos allowed to experiment inside their country needs to be guarding against country injuring rare disasters and both of these agents will be falling down on their jobs if they spend all their resources guarding against imagination capturing disasters that are genuinely out of character for Reality and not just being insulted by being called names like impossible So common level disasters rare level disasters

Ruins the soil is common Tonia says Attracts new pests that grow to unusual size is common Grows too well and takes over your other fields too is common All of thoseve happened to my father or my grandfather Angers the fae is happens to someones cousin in another village

The usual rule is that as you go up the tech ladder the danger levels go up because the power levels go up meaning that smaller missteps can have larger effects I do not get the impression that this is the tiniest bit untrue of magic and Golarion but just to check 

Seems right The Worldwound was caused by a fight among gods Most other really bad things I can think of were caused by epic wizards

As you get more clever at breeding plants you can to some degree even in dath ilan without magic manage to do a bit more damage than if you were less clever If you successfully use focused breeding to create corn that is incredibly resistant to the most common diseases around more disease resistant than any corn has ever been before it may be more likely than regular corn to take over all your other fields by accident

If you breed ultra fast growing plants and plant them repeatedly on the same land year after year they will suck key nutrients out of the soil unless you figure out what those nutrients are and take extra steps to replenish them Even if you figure out how to provide the plants with the nutrients that they need to keep growing the fast grown plants may end up less nutritious for people or animals who eat those plants unless you replenish aspects of the soil that arent as obvious Subtle deficiencies that people may not notice at first especially if people are eating the older crops too for a while If you figure out how to fix the short term problem of your fast growing crops dying by replenishing the aspects of soil that just the plants need you may not replenish enough of key tiny nutrients that people need Praying for guidance sure would be helpful for that sort of thing if it worked perfectly reliably But even leaving aside the point that apparently prophecy is broken now it seems wiser for you to try to develop the skill that we needed in godless dath ilan like at least write down in advance what you predict the guidance will be before you pray for guidance

You rotate crops says Tonia And maybe take soil samples to see how other older crops grow in them

Rotating crops helps some doesnt fix the whole problem because theres some things that almost every crop takes from the soil How much is it helping Feed your rotated fast grown crops and non rotated fast grown crops and slowly grown crops to mice or other animals that grow in even faster generations and see how the three groups do health wise relative to each other Keep your eyes open dont wait for problems to materialize before you start looking imagine things that might go wrong and look for them early maybe youll catch something you didnt imagine while youre looking for some possible problem you did imagine the important thing is to keep your eyes open wider

Besides soil depletion if you figure out how to grow more crops faster theres one other problem thats very predictable that happens because of how well you succeeded at plant breeding and it leads into another one of those larger points Suppose you produce a single field of corn all of one strain thats the best corn youve ever seen It grows fast its resistant to disease and insects and strong winds its tastier than the previous corn you feed it to mice and the mice do fine You find well you probably dont have replicators you find somebody reliable to verify your reports and you take that corn strain and sell it to farmers all over Cheliax A year later its the most profitable corn anyone has ever seen and only a complete fool of a farmer would grow anything else the next year Two years later its the only strain of corn that anyone still grows in Cheliax and its starting to displace other crops that are less profitable to grow All massively replicated out of that one original field

What happens next

If theres a blight itll take out half our food crop says Tonia Because everything will have the exact same vulnerability

Not if There will be a blight Its not just that theres a corn blight and Cheliax is growing too much corn Its that blight itself is a form of life and it reproduces and blight that targets this exact strain of corn will reproduce faster on this exact strain of corn and then reproduce just as fast when it jumps to the next ear of corn that all came through the same bottleneck and all has the same genetic information inside it Everything still alive has an internal system that counterattacks and resists disease and since everything has slightly different tiny spirals all the internal systems use slightly different counterattacks and methods of resistance If all the ears of corn are too similar to each other if you copied too much of the tiny spirals too fast and made too many organisms out of them because they were such great tiny spirals and such great organisms the disease thats mutating and reproducing and targeting those exact disease fighting systems will get too good at targeting those exact disease fighting methods and wipe them all out

The same thing would happen if we produced a kid with INT 20 and there was magic for copying kids and somebody got the bright idea that Cheliax needed a million kids like that Theres a million tiny variants of even minor diseases one of those variants would happen to be really strong against that exact form for a disease fighting system and then instead of the disease just killing that one kid hed sneeze and that variant would jump to the copy of the kid and then the next copy and the next and that variant would be just as effective against all of them

Thats one reason why dath ilan doesnt take the thousand brightest men in the whole world and try to have them each get ten thousand women pregnant Its copying too much of the heritage information too fast

 also sounds logistically difficult someone mutters

Hey if doing that sort of thing wouldnt kill everyone jumping 2 Intelligence points in a generation would be worth a few logistical difficulties

His audience which is definitely interpreting a few logistical difficulties as youd have to have the men under an exceptionally powerful Dominate Person with a team of dedicated clerics healing them and keeping them under nods seriously

Keltham who is definitely interpreting a few logistical difficulties as some mix of men mastering the partial ejaculation technique if theyre doing it the fun way and otherwise divide up the sperm quickly so its still healthy during the mass insemination process continues

One reason Im giving you this caution obviously is so that if you do start getting results from more directed and clever heritage optimization you dont push your luck the disease counterattack is close to a universal hazard if you start deriving too many children from too few parents

The larger point is that variation itself is a kind of resource It doesnt just apply to variation of disease fighting systems although that sure is one of the clearest cases of it If youre tackling a difficult mental problem and youve got five people on your team adding a sixth person who thinks in a different way from the first five people is often a larger boost than adding somebodys previous acquaintance from a previous job who had a lot of similar life experience There are also benefits to people knowing each other to be clear but the longer youve hammered on a problem without solving it the more likely it is that you need somebody new

The variation of your crops is a kind of resource that plant species has making it more likely that at least some of it survives when it gets challenged with a new kind of weather a new kind of pest When you apply powerful breeding pressures to a crop and squeeze it through narrow bottlenecks of parentage you lessen that variation as a side effect and make the crop probably less resilient in some dimensions even if youre improving it in others Variation is a kind of resource for heritage optimization and the process of heritage optimization uses some of it up

This ties into something that in dath ilan is seen as a central dichotomy of all lifes existence a dichotomy between He needs to be careful in speaking here so that the direct spell supplied translation from the dath ilani terms into Taldane doesnt give away his point too early diversity and optimality After all if theres a best way to do things wouldnt doing it any different way necessarily be doing it worse

Think about the logic I showed you earlier today the one which can derive exactly all of the actual consequences of the premises and no non consequences of the premises If you had a logic that was meaningfully different from that one wouldnt it have to be in some sense worse

I pose to you this question then which I have not yet told you how to answer Is diversity only ever valuable in places where we havent found the best strategy Is there necessarily some optimal disease fighting system an organism could have which could fight off every different form of disease that exists and if an organism had that it could be duplicated a million times without worry

its like war Theres not a single best military strategy that defeats all other military strategies There are things that work out best for a range of possible things your opponents might be doing and you cant be engaged in the best possible tactic against anything they might be doing there are tradeoffs best disease fighting system sounds less ridiculous than best war fighting system but I think only because we know how to fight wars so the tradeoffs are obvious

Well perhaps perhaps But lets consider some much simpler case than complicated oppositional games Do you have locks here which go by knowledge Say somebody has to punch in a series of numbers or spell out a sequence of words to open the lock

No Wizards use magic for locks Everyone else I think uses mechanical ones with keys

Theres a dath ilani proverb to the effect that a key and a code is more effective than just a key or a code because keys can be stolen as codes can be spied on But maybe that doesnt apply if theres a first circle spell that makes keys only work in the hands of authorized holders 

 mostly I dont know how youd do a lock with a code Ive never heard of that

Buttons labeled 0 through 9 youve got to enter six numbers in the correct order to open the lock I would not have thought that would take a very complicated mechanism it seems very simple compared to other mechanisms Heck with sixteen buttons just needing to depress the correct eight buttons in any order while leaving the eight other buttons raised would provide significant protection That seems very easy to visualize as a lock though making it not be externally obvious when you have some of the buttons correct but not others would take more work 

Well anyways in dath ilan there are locks which require a key or numbers or both depending on how strong you want to make them and whether youre more worried about stolen keys or spied on codes And security issues like making sure that somebody cant tell which numbers are being depressed by listening to the sound of the clicks or not having the interior mechanism of the key be examinable from the outside of the key before its inserted into the lock stuff like that

Is there such a thing as there being one best code or one best key that you could use to fend off the greatest possible number of thieves and then no better code or better key than that could exist

No the class choruses 

Isnt that in some sense contradictory to the very notion of intelligence If you can measure intelligence with numbers and keep going past 20 past 30 past 100 shouldnt there come a point where the greatest possible and most perfect intelligence can determine the one best possible code for a lock

 I guess eventually you could come up with a number so long and hard to specify that no one less smart that you is capable of generating it and thatd be the best possible code for a lock

Well its good that you dont just say no and give up on the question In dath ilan once you get past the kind of locks that parents use to keep young children from wandering into the workshop or the no word for that then where do they do it cuddle room you get whats called Keeper locks though they also appear on the more powerful weapons the military is allowed to own One component of a Keeper lock is a kind of key thats physically impossible to duplicate though it has to be refreshed each time its used the other component is a game that never plays out the same way twice with rules of a form that our brains can learn subconsciously without ever figuring them out consciously The knowledge that gets you inside consists of you having learned to play the locks game after a few days or hours of practice and occasional refreshers and you dont consciously know what the games rules are so you literally cant explain to anybody else how to get inside even if they drug you

But lets say the lock just has ten digits and six numbers

Can an entity with Intelligence 100 determine the best possible six number sequence that every such lock should use

No they chorus again

Well why not exactly

The only thing that makes a code good is that no one knows it

So use your Intelligence 100 to pick out the best possible code that people are least likely to guess

 well if its in every lock then theyll just put a bunch of sl employees to work trying it on one lock and once they get it theyll know all the locks

Ah well perhaps Lets look at it from the other side if theres a ten digit six number lock I need to get through can I use my 100 Intelligence to discover the single best sequence to try on a lock like that

 yeah you could mindread the creator and figure out what rule they used to set it

Let us suppose that mindreading is not possible clever guessing is You cannot determine a single correct code with certainty just that some codes are more likely than others I put to you then that the code which is most likely to open the lock is the best code to try entering into it

The students agree with this but suspiciously

Well for concrete example if a silly factory makes all its locks with a default code of 012345 and occasionally some silly people forget to change the default code then 012345 might be the best code to try entering it may only open one in ten thousand locks because very few people are that silly but it will still open more locks than any other code

Or if theres a number thats lucky in some religion so people change their locks to that

Wait so they actively change their lock to one thats Can you tell me whether or not youre joking about that being a thing people would really do I havent actually met anyone with Intelligence 10 in my life before and I dont know what thats like

 yeah people do that

I mean we dont have that kind of lock but people do that sort of thing they have magic item passwords that are famous magic item passwords or the names of their kids

All right Duly noted You people seriously need to raise your average intelligence level before somebody accidentally blows up whats left of the planet

To resume where we left off Having thus determined that 012345 is the best the most optimal code you can possibly try on a lock I put to you that clearly the optimal strategy for opening a coded lock is to repeatedly try 012345 on it until it opens Agreed

Suspicious chorus Noooo

Why not Seems reasonable to me If you have the optimal best method you should keep using it

I guess if the lock has a persistent tendency to change its own password to 012345 because it has fond memories of the workshop it was created in Meritxell says

Careful with that kind of cleverness Theres another famous dichotomy between being smart enough to think of correct answers versus smart enough that you can take any answer and come up with a weird way for it to be correct In real life entering 012345 repeatedly into the lock is stupid even though its possible to imagine an exotic circumstance where it isnt Im not saying you should never think the way you just did Im saying that you should always clearly label it inside and outside as having come up with a clever weird circumstance under which it would make sense to do something that is in real life stupid

Anyways Im glad you all now agree with me that the best way of getting through number sequence locks is to repeatedly enter in 012345 on them

 you just said that was stupid

That was some other Keltham Im the Keltham who thinks that repeating 012345 is a great strategy and hes going to keep lecturing you on that until one of you manages to talk him out of it by explaining exactly what hes doing wrong

They giggle nervously 

If it didnt work the first time then itll only work this time if the lock magically changed and changed to this specific code and you havent got any reason to think it did that so you might as well just set a construct to trying all possible combinations in order at this point before you try any twice

Wait so youre saying that 012345 isnt the best code to try Whats the better one then

Any of them which you havent tried yet

Im confused If on the first turn 012345 is the best combination to try and the lock hasnt changed it should still be the best combination to try on the second turn

 no because if it were right it wouldve opened the lock so now you know its wrong

So what youre saying is that my knowledge about the lock changed but not the lock itself I suppose I could buy that Doesnt that mean Id have to keep on changing which things I tried as I observed the results and my knowledge kept changing though That sounds inconvenient and difficult and not very Lawful really

Theyre so confused

I mean you probably want to build a construct Pela who has been arguing for this solution for a while says more firmly Which just tries every number in order And you expect that its one of the remaining numbers until youve tried them all

Wouldnt it be better to build a Lawful construct instead of a Chaotic one which repeatedly used the optimal number instead of like all these other non optimal numbers Im definitely gonna do that if you dont talk me out of it somehow Gonna be a great construct The best Optimal

 trying every number in order is plenty Lawful Law has nothing to do with doing the exact same thing over and over

Carissa who is going to be able to resolve the bet this evening proposes everyone double or nothing on their is Keltham a sadist betting

If its the best thing you should do it over and over If its not the best thing you should do the best thing instead If that isnt Lawful then what is Law exactly

It stops being the best thing once youve tried it

Law is if youre doing a dumb thing and you think its Lawful youre probably just confused about what Law is it doesnt mean you have to do dumb things

Well perhaps I am confused about the Law because I thought it said to do a dumb thing but then what is the Law actually Can it be explained to me or do I just have to enter whichever exact codes you tell me to

I dont think approaches to guessing a password can be Lawful or Chaotic And weve been telling you the thing you should do which is try all the numbers in order

All right speaking more seriously now Its easy to tangle yourself up with paradoxes of what is best what is optimal especially when you define the word even slightly different ways see it from slightly different angles across two times you used the word Theres a mistake that young dath ilani make skewing male rather than female though also some girls and not all boys of course where they cant quite accept the fact that older children know more than they do and have higher measured cognitive powers and some of them get fascinated with the ways that you can tangle up your reasoning and prove that youre actually better than the older children because youre more ignorant than they are or smarter than the optimal way of doing something

Its one of the things where when a boy makes a mistake like that the older children and the Watchers dont try to talk him out of it and let him go on believing it for a few years so he can have his enjoyment and also learn a valuable life lesson when hes old enough to more carefully disentangle all of the paradoxes This valuable lesson is that paradoxical sounding questions have non paradoxical answers if you define everything precisely enough and dont mix up your words Even if you cannot see the answer yet you should expect that such an answer exists Confusion exists in our minds not in consistent mathematics

In this case I could formalize the solution by saying for example that there is such a thing as a best sequence of codes to try given your state of knowledge about the lock and that repeatedly trying the most likely first code forever is among the worst possible sequences Or I could say that since our knowledge changes with each observation the best second code to try given the results of observing the first code is not equal to the best first code to try This I realize may not sound particularly better than any of the other arguments you were using against silly Keltham but they fit into larger frameworks I can talk about later A dath ilani would tell you that youre mistaken in thinking that theres no Lawful approach to guessing a code you can use math to describe your beliefs about which codes have which probabilities of working describe mathematically how those probabilities change with each observation as successive codes are ruled out and that math then describes the next best guess That doesnt mean you can do better by thinking explicitly in math of course instead of just quickly typing in possible passwords that seem likely but the math does exist

On a larger scale the point I want to make again is about that dichotomy between optimality and diversity the reason why you dont want to take a single stalk of corn and plant exact copies of it all over the country When we talked about the case of the lock and its codes we got two different angles on a way to resolve the childrens paradox of it apparently not being best to just use the best answer The first angle is that of the adaptive adversary the corn blight the master criminal considering the lock the more regular we make our own answer the more the adversarys adaptivity or intelligence is able to analyze and defeat it We use randomization as a way to make it harder for their own intelligence to grasp theres nothing paradoxical about the idea that the more random something is the less knowable it is the more it may inconvenience some other mind Its the kind of variation thats valuable in the disease fighting systems inside human and corn the kind that makes it harder for diseases to learn our defenses

But the other viewpoint on the lock and code is the more important one Its the reason why if your team has been having trouble solving a problem for a while you might want to add a new person who thinks less like the rest of you Its a resource that a field of corn stalks has for adapting to a sudden shift in the environment a new weather extreme if the crop is more diverse maybe some hardier stalks will survive to be replanted next year and then do better against that environment Its the kind of variation where youre trying things in many places and because of that trying overly similar things in many places is something that yields less expected profit to you

There are dimensions of society in which you want everyone behaving differently so they can explore a space instead of all crowding together into one corner of it There are dimensions of society where things go pretty well so long as you do something the correct way and start to go poorly if you do things much differently than that There is a tension in dath ilan between positions between people and factions between ideas and arguments about that question not just about particular cases but about the sense in general of where all society should move on that spectrum Whether it is more important in general for everyone to do things a bit more differently in our future or if the problem is more that were falling too far below some standards and we all need to improve in those ways together There are lots of particular cases in dath ilan where people might hold different opinions and not just one general opinion but there is a sense that this general dimension of existence is one where the exact balance is important to a society

Dath ilan has terminology for this dichotomy of strategies between the search to find the optimal best answer and use it versus trying many different answers to be more resilient against unknowns and explore a space more widely Though Ive been deliberately substituting the words optimal and diverse in this language instead of the two Taldane words that the translation spell tries to automatically output

If I say the dath ilani words directly for these two directions a society can move along this dimension they come out in this language as

Lawful

And Chaotic

Elias Abarco is not an eighteen year old girl and is not going to gape wonderingly at Keltham because EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE No one would notice since hes invisible but he nonetheless has too much dignity

Some things make sense And some things are even more confusing because 

 why not say that humans can understand that 

Reality is so very large and pretty and connected when you catch a sight of it She wants to see more

Nice Ione thinks all the way up where her conscious mind can hear it

I was on the side of Chaos of course Lawfulness seemed so very boring I was quite sure we had enough of it already

Theres a saying in dath ilan that always sounded to me before like sententious pro Law propaganda whose depth of meaning I think I never really appreciated until I came to Golarion

Its the saying that even Chaos is almost entirely made of Law

Some variation in the corn stalks is useful for resisting disease or having any survivors if an especially hot summer comes If you scramble all the tiny spirals entirely and insert completely new information what you get is not much higher levels of useful Chaos you get a plant that entirely fails to form The wildest most diverse crop that still manages to live at all must be almost entirely regular and using almost completely standard forms of everything for its species otherwise it comes out not weird and warped but simply a dead seed that fails to germinate at all When youre adding a new and different mind to your team full of wild ideas they should hopefully be speaking mostly grammatical sentences that make sense and not uttering random words and random sounds and twitching around wildly on the floor The full absence of Law is not diversity but randomness noise In many cases nearly all the random ways of doing things get you pretty much the same effect there is not much difference in contribution between a person wildly twitching on the floor in one way versus a different way they look much the same from outside Even diversity has to be almost entirely made out of shared order and climb high up on the scale of optimality away from the level of noise in order to be effectively diverse

Even Chaos is made almost entirely out of Law I thought it was something of a sententious old proverb that was emphasizing one particular viewpoint on an underlying truth that seemed overly trivial I wanted to think thoughts that nobody had ever thought before sure well of course I didnt want to do that by thinking random words obviously I wanted to start companies or invest in companies that nobody else would have thought of that no other investor would invest in I wanted to show that the way I thought differently was better and worthy of further exploration Of course if I wanted to pull that off successfully it would be a matter of art and skill governed by laws with relevant history to study and relevant investigations to do I thought that sort of thing didnt belong to Law alone Chaotic people like me could say it too so there wasnt anything especially Lawful about it

Even Chaos is made almost entirely out of Law in a fashion governed by higher orders mathematics whose name in Baseline also tends to translate into Taldane as Law I have gotten to this place Golarion I have heard what many of your countries are doing It is pretty clear that even the factions called Lawful seem to be confused about many things And I am resigned at this point to the fact that at some point I am also going to have to go and somehow straighten out all the Chaotic parts because it seems pretty likely at this point that all yall are also doing that part all wrong

In conclusion The value of diversity in your heritage and its nature as a kind of resource that strong optimization uses up especially variation that has the nature of useful variations rather than destructively random variations is another reason why if you meet a human visitor from another plane with 18 Intelligence its a great time to make an exception to any usual social rules about not just subsidizing the very best men to have 144 kids apiece because the diversity of your heritage will actually go up when you add in some kids from a smart alien and some of your kids may think a little differently and be more useful to add to projects This concludes my sales pitch I have added in many of the caveats that I knew about but I may have been biased in my thinking about them nonetheless I have tried to give you the knowledge youd need to do your own thinking about it independently

Any questions

In your conception of Chaos says Meritxell what would a Chaotic god be like

That is a really excellent question and I just flatly do not understand where say Calistria fits into this picture One guess is that there are additional things wrapped up in the divine version of Chaos besides the dath ilani words that translate into it which would make sense of how women being vengeful at men could be especially Chaotic Another guess is that I dont understand your society well enough to understand how Calistria is a move in the direction of wider exploration or less centralized planning

Carissa thinks she has an idea of that actually but she doesnt want to be that person who wants to talk about sexism every day like she cares what happens to other people

Theres another few questions none all that deep the class is still a bit theologically startled and no ones really quite sure whats heresy here 

Keltham whos already worrying that he stretched the endurance of his students and he cant see this because of Cheerful Cheliax Dignity restrains himself from any overly deep answers Afterwards he attempts to dismiss the class for the afternoon later on after hes rested some hes going to try learning wizard spells with the last of his day Well his workday anyways

Teacher says Ione Sala with a faint smile thats all she can manage and a voice that should be more seductive but isnt can I stay a moment after class and ask you something in private

No sweat Calm If she lets herself feel too much shell sweat and that will be visible Dont think dont feel nothing except whats necessary now

Keltham tilts his head weighs the matter nods He has no room on his schedule left for today but he can as easily say that to her in private and doesnt exactly want to discourage people from asking

 well thats bold 

Carissa files out succeeding at looking totally unthreatened by this and actually succeeding at being mostly unthreatened by this The kid has barely talked shes getting a late start

 which is suggestive that theres something up here that Carissa doesnt understand 

She turns invisible on leaving the classroom and turns around to slip back in

Move along Elias tells her telepathically and also curtly

 so this is not about flirting with Keltham

She moves along

Ione considers possible options she has to theres no choices except thinking now If she leads into words that sound like like what shes planning to say then the security team wont they wont jump to conclusions right theyll know Ione knows that theres security there but people dont always think what you wish they would think 

Ione casts Detect Magic and while Kelthams head is turned watching the last students go she gives her best significant solemn nod to the invisible security team

Keltham doesnt particularly see it

When the last students are gone and of course the security team is still there Ione approaches Keltham Did you mean what you said about how dath ilan sees Law and Chaos she inquires in a low voice now trying to look serious and not seductive at all

Yes Keltham is more surprised than disappointed

Will you keep my important personal secret if I tell it to you Ione says Serious she has to look serious

Does that commit me to anything more than just not repeating your secret not giving it away by other means unless and until the information makes its way to me by channels unrelated to the fact of your originally telling it to me

Ione takes a moment to parse this It sounds right and if hes trying to trick her well it doesnt really matter does it

No that sounds correct

Then yes Keltham doesnt know what this is about and might on other occasions hesitate more to learn others secrets but he is definitely currently in the sort of situation where he should say yes to secrets offered under standard secrecy conditions

I have sympathies in directions that are not all the way to the side of Lawful which is a thing that some of your other girls might accept about me and some would think it meant they needed to steer clear of me On the whole its more convenient for me if its just not suspected But youre a whole lot clearer on why Chaos would exist and why it would have any use or any place in the universe than than I even understood myself before you well people here are confused like you said

It takes a second for Keltham to hypothesize why this would be as terribly serious of a matter as glance at nametag again Ione Sala is making it sound even taking into account that Lawful versus Chaotic is an even bigger political deal here and that people here are kind of strange about politics

Is the idea here that youre secretly not with Asmodeus Keltham says now instinctively lowering his own voice

She wasnt even planning to but if he wants that hopes for it 

Knowledge she says she wishes she could make her voice breathy and seductive but its all she can do to stay in the guidelines of solemnity mysteries the planes the way that everything is connected magic trying new things Nethys

She hasnt said outright that she belongs to Nethys which she doesnt know maybe that will count for something oh shes so dead 

I will keep your secret since if you had not trusted me I couldnt have done anything with that secret anyways But I hope you understand that Im not planning to betray the Chelish government or Asmodeus unless they betray me first Or are you telling me that theyve done so

Ione quickly shakes her head and then says No out loud in case dath ilani dont understand headshakes Im not telling you that Just 

She cant make herself sound seductive enough not under this much tension But Kelthams society has some kind of weird posturing about frankness maybe even just values actual frankness in a balance whose possibility she cant understand so if she tries to pretend that kind of honesty play to that 

Im sorry she says hoping shes successfully putting sincerity into her voice I Im not very experienced in some ways I wish I could say this in a way thats more pleasing to you She swallows which takes almost no effort at all and makes sure shes looking Keltham straight in the eyes To someone who belongs to Nethys who wants to understand magic understand everything the mysteries behind them and how everything is connected what you told us all today its more than someone who follows Nethys could easily repay If you keep teaching me things like that or us I dont mind if others learn it too like you said its about how much we score for ourselves not scoring better than others then Ill try to teach you magic or help you on your project to change Golarion or clean your room for you Id do it even if you didnt pay me hes sort of weird about wanting to pay people not that it would be bad if you did pay me of course but the knowledge is to someone who follows Nethys its priceless And in terms of what you probably guessed before that I was going to talk to you about that could be part of it too You could use me however you wanted anytime you wanted in that way too even if you werent going to give me a child then or ever Ill do anything you like you can ask or I can try to guess and you wont have to try to make me feel good too unless you want to I can just serve you if you want To somebody who belongs to Nethys knowledge like that is worth it

Keltham is not entirely unmoved by this Hes starting to wonder in the back of his mind what all of his other confessions will be like this is starting to resemble a certain kind of dath ilani fiction in some ways but this one is an interesting flavor yeah

Hes also not taking it entirely at face value of course hes not a complete idiot and the resemblance to fiction may or may not be telling

How much trouble are you in if the Chelish government finds out about this Keltham says a careful kind of probe with many possible returns

I mean its hard to look suppose I asked you in dath ilan whether people ever got in trouble for things they theoretically shouldnt get in trouble for how would it work for you Because she has absolutely no idea what Keltham is going to find at all plausible here

Governance gets in trouble for violating the rules same as anybody else For them to avoid that theyd have to I dont know put somebody into cryonic suspension and make it look like an accident Somehow be in collusion with the Keepers and get them to falsely declare an infohazard which you know would not be even the tiniest bit easy at all and there are lines of double checking there too I mean theres a much smaller order of very smart people whose point is basically supposed to be Keep an eye on the Keepers Im not sure what level of antisocial collusion youre trying to ask about or postulate

Things are just less organized in Golarion Keltham Sometimes people play things safer here than they must do in dath ilan because they arent connected to a giant miracle that stores all the knowledge in the world and they dont know how everything works inside the villa they just came to from the wizard school they were in before that I mean maybe if I suddenly vanish and you never hear from me again or Im suspiciously assassinated in the middle of class that would be something to notice She really hopes that she just unsigned her death warrant instead of signing it I would not expect the typical member of the Chelish government to do that to me I wouldnt expect them to do anything at all to me what with the typical member of Chelish government being nowhere near her but Im in a different place than I was yesterday and you expect me to be surer of myself than I am

I dont understand why youd tell this to me then if it was true and not a trap set to see if Im planning to betray Asmodeus Youre not worried about listeners behind the walls magical eavesdropping

Think think think I mean if there are that part of the government isnt famous for telling everything they hear to the rest of the world or even the rest of the government you know and I just I think maybe Nethys would be pleased if I helped you learn magic or just helped you spread the kind of knowledge that youre spreading Youve changed my life much more than you realize with what you said there because of what happened inside me when I heard it and it seemed right to tell you about that and to offer to do what I can for you

Thank you for telling me if you were in fact being honest Ill keep your putative secret and wont use it against you unless I relearn by means unconnected to how I first learned it in the ways considered usual in dath ilan for keeping a secret that was promised I will have to think about what that means for a relationship between us I was not expecting that offer and its not something where I already know internally how Ill respond even conditioned on all of that being completely true

Ione kneels in front of him and bows her head I am at your command and at your pleasure teacher she says and maybe even manages to make it sound a little low and husky Whenever you decide And no matter what you decide thank you

Keltham exits

It certainly has been a day

Ione straightens up It still doesnt seem wise to think or feel anything unnecessary Her heart is hammering very hard nonetheless and there is sweat though not she hopes visible sweat Well it wouldnt be surprising if she looked nervous to whoever will be speaking to her now

Elias has a Mage Hand not quite gouge out her eyeball even though hes tempted itll make her useless for the next ten minutes and theres some information he ought to urgently have But press against her eyeball relentless enough to force her to turn her face

It would be pretty inconvenient he says to have someone permanently impersonate you but Ive got to say youre shaping up to be even more inconvenient than that which is really quite an achievement Who was it

Can she hide it maybe pretend it was all a seduction scheme that got away from her ask for a talisman that makes her look like an oracle of Nethys no thats not going to work in real life somebody will check her current aura in detail before they give her a talisman like that 

Nethys made me his oracle I didnt ask for it I didnt know it would happen I was just thinking about wanting to know more things and I suppose I thought too loudly I will cooperate with the Chelish government in anything it asks so long as that doesnt turn Nethys against me in my afterlife

Fail your will save say that again

She fails her will save Nethys made me his oracle I didnt ask for it or know it would happen Ill cooperate with the Chelish government on anything that doesnt turn Nethys against me

Repeat word for word Youll confirm once Keltham is competent enough to check the claim youre an oracle of Nethys that Cheliax isnt betraying him and that were representing our church the way Nethyss church represents it

I will confirm once Keltham is competent enough to check the claim Im an oracle of Nethys that Cheliax isnt betraying him and that were representing our church the way Nethyss church represents it

Its serious misconduct to try to come to Kelthams attention just to alter the balance of considerations against killing you If three girls do that hes going to conclude somethings up Maybe two

I was afraid that if I just let you find out and kill me or remove me which is what youd obviously do it would go against what Nethys wanted from me and I dont know what Nethys does to mortals who offend Him inside His afterlife I just know that He can drive people mad at any time I wasnt trying to inconvenience you I wasnt even trying to live I was just trying to make sure Nethys didnt shatter my soul for not trying 

Well Ill submit the situation for review Elias says coldly and now he can gouge her eyeball out the conversation being over 

Someone will come by to heal it in an hour or so Theyre not savages

Its not her most painful punishment

Ione Sala will lie on the floor and try not to move and hold a hand over the eye socket so she doesnt bleed out too much and endure

Everything has changed

People will still force her to let them read her mind so there are a lot of things she should not think must not think about how everything has changed

Nethys is her god now 

Not thinking that

Knowledge magic 

Not thinking that

Whats Nethyss afterlife like if she can serve Him well

Not thinking that

Deep down she really really really wasnt looking forward to 

Definitely not thinking that

She wipes the smile hard off her face as soon as she notices that its there

Otolmens is as furious as She has ever been at any point in the last aeon which is something of a narrow range on both sides but still

They NEVER LISTEN

She specifically told them She told them ALL that they were not allowed to do ANYTHING NONSTANDARD around THAT mortal and then Nethys goes and drops FOUR ORACLE LEVELS on some nearby mortal that Otolmens would not have THOUGHT was particularly dangerous but if Nethys wants this mortal to have FOUR ORACLE LEVELS than She wants this mortal COMPLETELY OUT OF HER MULTIVERSE along with that OTHER ONE

While Otolmens will not of course break The Rules regardless of provocation she knows how The Rules work on Golarion and if Nethys is openly opposing Her which He most certainly now is and doing so by means of granting levels to mortals then that opens up more options for Her as well

A halfling slave in the halls performing his endless task of cleaning up after the idiots and their endless messes is now very suddenly a fourth level oracle of Otolmens

He is immediately arrested by security

Keltham successfully finds his way back to his bedroom lies down in bed closes his eyes and tries to think in a dath ilani deliberate resting pattern Hes not very good at it but he knows it anyways since its one of those things where its better if everybody knows how to do it a little even if theyre not very good at it

Carissa asking him whats Chaotic for a dath ilani 

Not thinking that

Ione speaking awkwardly not with the dignified cheerfulness of her rare vocalizations in the libary bent in that strange lowered posture with her head facing down 

Not thinking that

Every few hours he updates again about conditions in Golarion being even worse though apparently all random local landing regions are as bad as the Worldwound was successfully an overshoot of where that was heading 

Not thinking that either His brain needs to rest

He needs to figure out what people here use instead if cuddleroom doesnt translate to Taldane And also is there any way to figure out whether his contraception is still active or if he wouldve gotten rid of it by using healing energy on himself last night Maybe he can find security and ask them who to ask

Okay both valid questions but nonetheless be still his brain This morning he got woken up by light in the windows instead of waking up to his own rhythm and it is more than plausible that his brain will now benefit from at least a brief nap Learning wizard magic will probably go better with relatively less tired brains

All right you know what there is a lot of divine interference here and waiting until tonight to get the girls to sell their souls seems like it might be waiting too long 

Elias goes after Carissa first since she cannot in fact be gotten tonight

Carissa was going to take a bath but manages to be graceful about being interrupted

Tell me Elias says to her how you reconcile the teachings of our god with the teachings of dath ilan

Oh wow this conversation is going to suck Dath ilan is different from our world and I think less of Kelthams lessons transfer than he realizes she says blandly 

I forgot to mention Elias says that Im in a hurry and that your ability to say things that dont mean anything isnt in question Whats wrong

 hes got to be wrong about Law and Chaos because if thats all there was to it some church would explain it that way and they dont Hes got to be wrong about uh I think dath ilan teaches things well for if youre going for the Starstone but badly for if youre going to Hell because you dont need a lot of initiative at making progress on unstructured questions and developing it before youre a devil seems like it involves a lot of indulging lazy human impulses 

Cleverly said Is that a trade you want to make becoming less useful to Hell after death to be more useful to Keltham

 I think it serves Asmodeus for me to indulge weak human impulses temporarily if thats all I can do to try to understand dath ilans technology Well make Cheliax stronger and more powerful and more useful to Him and if I require more correction subsequently so be it

I think youll require different correction at least But there is opportunity to arrange it in advance

This is hardly even surprising so its confusing that Carissa feels like shes falling and like her fingertips are tingling Of course

Weve made arrangements with some devils for purchase contracts with the students here Take your time to read it over of course Were going to invite most of the students to a signing ceremony tonight but it sounds like youve made conflicting plans

Well I dont know can I bring a date asks Carissa sweetly Elias slaps her harder than that really warranted though it did warrant it hard enough to kill someone who wasnt a wizard Maybe hes otherwise having a bad day 

You have an hour to read it over and request any changes to the terms he says and apparently leaves

Carissa is not under the impression she is alone

She sits down Reads through the contract which doesnt take an hour 

And then takes her bath Shes not sure when else shes going to have the opportunity

Project Nap currently making excellent progress

Elias returns at precisely the time he said he would and starts a summons Did you have revisions

No Its a standard contract Shes read them before 

Did you pick your reward of appropriately commensurate value

Yes Be a professional do not squeal and jump up and down I selected permanent non dispellable arcane sight

Thats what I took too Elias says almost warmly 

Shes not going to get drawn in to small talk Do you want me to tell the kids its a standard contract I dont know how many of them will have looked one up

The ones who dont have the initiative to get confirmation they have a standard contract dont have a standard contract

Carissa reads hers one last time to double check

Summoned he comes

Ah Cheliax He adores Cheliax The contracts are on the bare side of whatll work under Law and the Chelish take them anyways because theyve been indoctrinated to believe that theyre going to Hell regardless And theyre not even wrong but a slave who cant escape is so much more valuable as a slave and the contract isnt worth but a fraction of that increase in value for the sort of soul that Cheliax sends to sign Theyve been given a rather selective history of contracts with devils and they believe theyre doing well for themselves as negotiators Devils fight and maim each other for the privilege to be summoned as contracting devils in Cheliax because the taste of it is so very very sweet

He doesnt speak at first simply takes the contract and reads it through

Standard For Cheliax

He turns then to the little mortal And who is this worm who seeks to merchant her soul already damned to He who is already its master

She feels like a silly little kid Which is of course the intent and also basically true next to a devil

 well shes doing more for Asmodeus than this devil is likely to have the chance to Shes going to revolutionize Golarion 

Carissa Sevar she says clearly and mostly calmly A human would think she was calm

Previously in Hell

The most important thing to understand about a god is that under almost all circumstances and with extremely rare exceptions their attention is not only divided but splintered

Perhaps unwittingly perhaps not Irori has threatened to get the better of Asmodeus in a bargain

Pride is among His domains

Asmodeus is a greater and much older god than Irori closer to the center of all things Compared to Irori Asmodeuss facets are larger the totality of the gem that is Him vastly bigger

Asmodeus is also in many more places at once compared to Irori

His decision must be the equivalent of a snap decision made in reflex in much less time than Irori had to think

Yet even His reflex thoughts are vast and able

The bargain now sealed between Himself and Irori specifies much to avoid Asmodeus getting the better of Irori in simple and obvious ways He may not direct His church to specially monitor or distrust the mortal Carissa Sevar nor through the particulars by which the mortal is given freedom of travel in Cheliax if the time comes to sell its soul may Asmodeus insinuate anything which works to that mortals disadvantage or makes it a target in the eyes of His church Asmodeus is constrained in how He may expect the results of His commands to appear their impacts upon the mortal And there are old treaties regarding what the denizens of Hell may say to the living besides

There is nonetheless a loophole in all that if Asmodeus is giving an unbound mortal free passage through Cheliax The whole affair must look at least a little odd The contract cannot demand that these events not look odd He cannot set His church upon the mortal by direct command nor by insinuation and what He knows or suspects His church will conclude He cannot disadvantage the mortal cannot work against it that does leave open other possibilities

It is possible that Irori taking longer to think foresaw this very loophole and that Asmodeus might try to exploit it if Asmodeus thought the contract to His own favor at all or regretted it after and that Irori deliberately forebore to close it because it is not Iroris way to protect mortals from trials

If so Asmodeus will take that play He does not know exactly what Irori saw when Irori looked at this mortal but when Asmodeus looked at it from His own angle it did not seem like the sort of mortal looking to flee Cheliax at the first opportunity to take an atonement

And besides if Asmodeus does not play this move then Irori gets the better of Him in a contract

All this goes through a splintered facet of Asmodeuss attention in a fractional moment of reflex before that splintered fragment directs a thought to a Duke of Hell who will not be shattered by it and then goes on to other parts of His business elsewhere on this plane The thought consists of the relevant facts and a statement of intents greater attention to the mortal details and specifying a precise policy around them is what underlings are for

Sign then says the devil He watches Carissa closely for any sign of hesitancy or falsehood in the motion

A human wouldnt detect any Carissa has known since she was two that she is going to go to Hell and might as well arrange in advance and get something for it She takes the pen and pulls the contract over to sign

He reaches out and snaps the pen from her hand as it is about to touch the contract

So eager he purrs But no His rather mystifying instructions leave some leeway here and he is curious about how the mortal Carissa Sevar will react he is curious of what material a mortal such as this is made

Not at all at first because thats a good default not reacting at all Elias is preparing a spell with the leisurely motions of a combat caster who isnt in a combat sort of hurry but no matter how much he takes his time she cant outrun him and 

 Kelthamll notice Kelthamll be suspicious 

Is there a problem she says a little sharply I have a date you see so perhaps youd better point it out

Oh he likes this one Hed like to rip her heart out specifically but thats how it is in Hell

Rejoice mortal for you have somehow come however momentarily to the attention of a god Asmodeus has made known to us a tiny fraction of His will and you are implicated in it

Elias she notes with distant satisfaction has stopped moving 

Theres a lot of that going around she wants to make her lips say its the perfect response but she cannot actually get the words out or any words 

Here is the will of Asmodeus as interpreted by Hell to his slaves of Church and Queen

Carissa Sevar is not to sell her soul to Hell this day

Carissa Sevar is to be allowed freedom of travel beyond Cheliax as if she had sold her soul

Carissa Sevar is to be allowed continued access to her teacher as if she had sold her soul

In matters apart from those Carissa Sevar is to be trusted rewarded and punished no more and no less than she has earned by Asmodeuss Law

Asmodeuss Church need not concern itself proactively with Carissa Sevars correction beyond the ordinary course of Asmodeuss Law but if Carissa Sevar seeks out theological instruction of her own accord her questions are to be given priority as though she were Asmodeuss own cleric of the fourth circle

Asmodeuss Queen and her slaves need not concern themselves proactively with Carissa Sevars descent into cruelty wickedness and the darkness of her own soul but if Carissa Sevar seeks to indulge of her own accord she is to be prioritized for support as though she were the inheriting daughter of a Count of Cheliax

Do you hear and understand these instructions slave of Church and Queen

Elias highly values his reputation for composure He values even more highly his ability to only say yes I understand if he actually understands so he pauses for several seconds reviewing in his head

I hear and understand he says 

Carissa does NOT understand

 and doesnt need to Right now One thing at a time

Here is the will of Asmodeus as interpreted by Hell to his slave Carissa Sevar But understand and be warned that these are not Asmodeuss true thoughts only Hells own understanding of them passed down from Asmodeus to Duke to Baron to this one small finger of Hell Asmodeuss thoughts may not be known to the likes of us and their truths are forbidden to speak in this world These are not Asmodeuss words to Carissa Sevar but only our understanding of His will

Serve Me well in this world and you shall be raised high in it

Remember that you are not Irori Do not think yourself likely to succeed in perfecting yourself without divine aid

Acknowledge the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis and accept that your rightful place is in Hell

Come to Me in Hell without thought of other choices as mortals once did in the days before they were cursed with their own wills and you shall be among the most treasured of My possessions

Carissa is not so overawed that she forgets to think that among the many reasons it might serve Asmodeus to express such a thing its true does not rate particularly high 

But she nods I understand Thank you

He stares at her for a long moment

You should be more excited and grateful little mortal Even most Barons of Hell have never come to our Lords direct attention It is doubtful that I ever will through all eternity I would dearly like to eat your heart right now

But see if she twitches her face she would start crying and that would be terribly pathetic and 

 and being small and reasonable was a good strategy ten minutes ago and isnt now come on Carissa if you play the wrong game you lose

 she reaches into the circle Reaches for his heart or where it would be if he were human

Did you hear what you just said she says Well see who gets to eat whose heart

It occurs to him then though only briefly that perhaps he ought to be the one who is afraid If she succeeds 

He turns from her I hope you fail and are cursed and that I am privileged to have custody of your soul I shall go file the request for it now in fact

And he departs

I have a shopping list she says to Elias turning around

Do you now he says

Im going to need to be prettier Every counts heir Ive ever seen was stunningly beautiful Dont you dare comment on my looks Ill stab you Im going to need to be prettier And I want a headband and an allowance for crafting

I dont actually know how much the inheriting daughter of a Count of I mean presumably they get their allowance from their county which you havent got 

Well maybe you should get me one Thats absurd but Elias looks unsure if its absurd which is very satisfying

Is this what gratitude for the extraordinary indulgence of your god looks like

Gratitude He wants a return And Im going to be perfect can I have the other girls souls

No says Elias Abarco with the first certainty hes mustered in a while 

Some kind of option on them Equity

You arent worth a damned thing yet kid

Asmodeus noticed me says Carissa Sevar but a rather different Carissa Sevar than she was ten minutes ago Also shes about to have a panic attack but shes pretty sure she can glare Elias out of the room before that

Keltham wakes up still feeling a bit muzzy What a long and complicated day he has had full of surprises For a moment he envies the women in his research harem who just get to hear lots of new and exciting knowledge and got raises and a sex flavored mission and didnt have to compose new lectures or try to figure out Golarion Not that its bad that their lives are less stressful than his just it would be good if his life was also less stressful than his life

Maybe hell put in a bit less effort into his first shot at wizardry than he was previously planning so hell have brainpower to spare for his date with Carissa after that After dinner After a light dinner He shouldnt be either hungry or overfull while you know that stuff is going on

His life sure is complicated these days full of structural uncertainty and random assorted difficult decisions But Kelthams not going to let that faze him Dath ilan raises strong minds

But before he continues on to prove that yet again hes going to lie here in bed with eyes closed a little longer waiting for the muzziness to go away of its own accord

And then hell either head off to find somebody for wizard lessons Ione or maybe join people for dinner depending on how long he actually slept because once again he forgot about that part where he is no longer wearing a wristwatch

Elias leaves

She should not assume shes alone but she doesnt have that much more stamina for maintaining composure She kneels at her bedside in a distinctly imperfect posture for prayer and hides her face in her hands and trembles violently until its possible to think about something other than the apparent deficit of air in this room That takes a couple of minutes

Asmodeus noticed her And Asmodeus has instructions for her And Asmodeus does not want her to sell her soul which 

 okay this is the most trivial feature of the situation but it means she does not get permanent undispellable arcane sight and she was really looking forward to that And all of the other girls are going to have it Shes going to be falling behind in magic lessons and have no way to explain why Not that shes ungrateful but Asmodeus couldve given His instructions and also taken her soul 

 presumably thats false actually presumably its actually important for some reason that Carissa keeps her soul she doesnt understand and she shouldnt expect to understand the reason here is not going to be in that space where a human thinking about it really hard can comprehend it its going to be in the space that a human cant make any sense of at all

But there are some features of the situation that she ought to be capable of comprehending or no one would have tried to tell her things 

Asmodeus noticed He noticed that she was trying to build the true philosophy the version that they would have come up in dath ilan where everyone is smarter and lawfuller and carefuller if they were also Asmodean and He thought it was worth directing her to do it properly And His direction was 

 she should write it down before she forgets 

She stops praying to do that 

Serve Me well in this world and you shall be raised high in it

Remember that you are not Irori Do not think yourself likely to succeed in perfecting yourself without divine aid

Acknowledge the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis and accept that your rightful place is in Hell

Come to Me in Hell without thought of other choices as mortals once did in the days before they were cursed with their own wills and you shall be among the most treasured of My possessions

And written down its kind of weird and she puzzles over it for a little while 

She was trying to build Asmodeanism as smart lawful humans would have been able to generate it able to understand it able to build a society around it But she was getting it wrong You are not Irori What an odd thing to say she didnt think she was Irori well maybe her vanity in fact got itself pointed that direction without her conscious attention but shes not sure the problem is the vanity because in the same breath she was promised to be raised high in the world if she serves Asmodeus well in it and among his most treasured possessions 

Acknowledge the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis 

 the problem is the Lawful Neutral Keltham is Lawful Neutral Keltham has taught her everything that she now understands about the true theology about what it would mean to have free will and know what to do with it But Keltham is Lawful Neutral even if he thinks hes evil so his conception is a lawful neutral conception of how things work 

And Carissa belongs to Asmodeus who is Evil and so shes supposed to be designing the evil version of that not the neutral one 

Carissa has not actually put a lot of thought into what Evil is Pretty much everyone is Evil because thats how Pharasma sorts them Doing big ambitious things in the world is Evil Kelthams probably going to start reading Evil at some point because he did something Pharasma objects to hes not in the two percent most Good people and pretty much everyone else goes to Hell But when she says Kelthams Neutral shes not actually talking about what Pharasma has to say shes talking about something else Keltham assumes theyre all getting paid Keltham would be deeply upset if he learned they werent getting paid and its not because it affects him in the slightest His sense of honor fair play however he contextualizes it rules out slavery rules out assassinations rules out tricking people theyre jokingly betting on whether Kelthams a sadist and she bets he is but he didnt jump at punishing the students he fretted that he had no idea how to do it in a way that improved their understanding of the subject material and was worried hed teach them wrongly to be afraid of school 

 shes not actually sure which parts of that are Lawful Neutral and which parts are dath ilan But they stand out as ways that an Asmodean is not As ways that the ideal Asmodean theology would not be And when she was trying to build something shaped like Keltham Asmodeus Himself reached out and conveyed thats too Lawful Neutral to be the truth Give me the Evil version

Well Carissa can do that

Carissa has spent a lot of time worrying if she is loyal enough but almost none worrying if she is Evil enough Shes not squeamish She doesnt refuse to report people out of misguided sympathy for them She has whipped students who get bad grades and practiced deadly spells on weeping prisoners She is definitely going to go to Hell and it did not really occur to her to specifically worry about how evil she was within the very broad category of everyone who gets sent to Hell She hasnt heard of anyone getting in trouble for not being Evil enough She hasnt even been threatened now with getting in trouble for not being Evil enough 

 and maybe thats the point Because theres a kind of Evil built of pure sharp selfishness the choice to be concerned with yourself and not with any of the other idiots populating the world the thing she told Keltham Evil as prioritizing the self She thinks shes perfectly adequate at that if she does say so herself 

The devil wasnt like that The devil saw her spoke two minutes to her and wanted to personally rip her into pieces Because itd be fun Because having seen her whole destroying her would be more of a treat than destroying some other person And there was a difference though she hopes no one noticed it when she stepped into his circle and threatened him back He was threatening her because he felt like it She was threatening him because shed noticed that if she didnt learn to play she was going to lose very very fast 

She is pretty sure in hindsight that every Evil thing shes ever done has been the first kind the weaker kind the Evil of choosing Carissa Sevar over every other person in the universe She feels entirely unapologetic about all of that Evil certainly no other person in the universe is choosing Carissa Sevar over themselves And if they were thatd be stupid and contemptible of them 

And Asmodeus is saying that thats not enough Well its clearly enough to get into Hell Its not enough for the nature that devil possessed not enough for her to actually succeed at the problem she has somewhat audaciously set herself of explaining theology better so people arent afraid of not understanding it any more than theyre afraid of not understanding math so they glimpse the outlines of the big real thing there even if thats all they glimpse

Acknowledge the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis Mainly its the desire to be on the winning side coupled with the conviction Axis isnt it but shes pretty sure thats not what He means What was it the devil said to Elias

She should write that down too shes going to need to use it to argue for a headband

Asmodeuss Queen and her slaves need not concern themselves proactively with Carissa Sevars descent into cruelty wickedness and the darkness of her own soul but if Carissa Sevar seeks to indulge of her own accord she is to be prioritized for support as though she were the inheriting daughter of a Count of Cheliax

Its embarrassing but she never until this point considered that prominent leaders might be so cruel and wicked because they specifically got training and theological education in it because it is part of what it means to be a servant of Asmodeus Probably you cant offer that to the whole country because it wont run well if everyones going around trying to develop their capacity for cruelty and wickedness But you can offer it to the person who is trying to reform all of Asmodean theology

All right whats an action plan for learning cruelty and wickedness and the darkness of her own soul Possibly it makes sense to start by observation She watched Contessa Lliratha and knew that she wanted that wanted to grow up to be that with an intensity that would have carried her through murdering lots of innocent people which isnt quite the thing but its a start possibly it makes sense to start by asking She has specifically been told that she can get support if she only asks 

Theres another thing she needs to master here The other thing the devil had that she didnt was presentation Carrying himself in the world like he did things for his own reasons and of course they were Asmodeuss reasons he said it outright but but he carried himself like he was enjoying every minute of it Carissa carries herself like shes loyal and competent and pretty sure she is getting a good grade and thats not how to get a good grade in wickedness Theres a reason Asmodeus said the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis rather than just acquire some desires that have no place in Axis and she doesnt think its because she has a secret kink for torture she wouldve noticed that Its because thats a way you can relate to Evil not as some habits of mind for the defense of the self under threat but as the delight of the self in pursuing all it pleases and in serving those who have even more power to do that 

I am ever your obedient servant she thinks at Asmodeus though it feels a lot scarier now that she knows theres a minute chance hes paying attention 

Is there an available wicked thing to do She could 

 oh shit shes late for Kelthams magic lessons 

She can hurry off to those and worry about this later

If magic lessons take anyone to the library at any point theyre going to encounter Ione Sala who has now been healed in flesh if not in spirit

Very shortly after being healed Ione Sala discovered that as soon as she gets a couple of dozen steps away from the library she starts to feel a pull a faint tingle which she can intuitively feel would start to weaken her abilities after a time and eventually rip her soul out of her body Shes going to need sleeping arrangements set up in here or in a room connected to here or for somebody to make her a bedroom thats also a library And it doesnt feel like books are enough to make a place a library people would need to be able to wander into her bedroom and read books there Ione also knows that she needs to occasionally read some of the books and get new books sometimes They have to be books she actually wants to read she cant just be doing it out of duty Otherwise shell die

Oracles get curses dont they

 this curse isnt entirely a bad thing It feels like Cheliax would have a hard time making there be a library thats also a torture chamber and force her to enjoy reading books while shed rather have her soul torn away so that the pain stops like it would be hard to torture her to death over years in a way that satisfies her curse Maybe she couldnt easily be maledicted either with the grip that libraries now have on her soul Is her curse one that takes her straight to Nethyss afterlife is that why it feels like the curse would tear out her soul and not just kill her Nethys shes trying not to think thoughts like this but they still bubble up in the back of her mind Nethys may have a different attitude from Asmodeus about making sure that His own slaves so long as they worked hard and did their best get protected from sufficiently painful fates

No shes being stupid Nethys wants her to be less afraid of Asmodeus and Cheliax obviously so that she doesnt treat them as having equal power with Nethys to threaten her and force her obedience

 she wishes she hadnt thought that its going to make Cheliax trust her less after the next time they read her mind The problem is that Ione is now living in such strange new circumstances that she doesnt know yet which paths of thought will lead her to dangerous places before she starts to think them She does have to think now and figure out what Nethys wants from her using her own wits Nethys cant give her specific instructions because anybody Nethys touches goes mad

Ione has been taught since childhood that nobody really cares about her or ever would care about her except for how shes of use to them especially the gods who could help but dont Its pathetic to think that Nethys would give her that curse because Nethys cared about one tiny worm that didnt even ask to be His cleric Lots of mortals in the world die agonizing slow deaths and Nethys doesnt protect them Asmodeus is the only god who has enough use for mortals in general being competent not just a few favored clerics to make sure that children in Cheliax get an education And while it has occurred to Ione that this is propaganda it has also occurred to her that it cannot just be a complete lie Its not like Nethys made her His oracle or helped her in any other way before she was in a position to be useful to Him

But its still a little warm to have a master who took real visible steps to protect her against the worst that other masters can do

So she will do her very best for Nethys as she has been thoroughly incentivized which will include Ione is very aware that she must think this and believe it as sincerely as she can being very very very obedient to the Chelish government and not inconveniencing them at all so they dont separate her from Keltham and replace her with an imposter

Time for alternatephysics reducedcapitalinfrastructure autarchicalpersonalproductivity fantasy

Keltham exits his room looking for any sort of local personnel or security personnel who can tell him which people he needs for magic lessons or failing that how to find Ione and ask her Hed ordinarily boop Carissa about that but Keltham is aware that Carissa herself might also want to nap before tonight even if her day hasnt been as exciting as his If Keltham doesnt run into any visible security personnel he will head towards the library to see if he can find somebody there

 A ten syllable recursively compounded term of Baseline that a literary author would use to describe the most important quality of Golarion magic from the standpoints of its effect on the plot enabling one person to do important things without a huge supply chain or a larger group that implements the effects Dath ilan has separately recognized a fantasy trope for phenomena that treat mental qualities as primary but their literature doesnt tie up mentalisticmagic tightly with economicmagic you can have one without the other Keltham has noticed that Golarion magic is mentalisticmagic as well as economicmagic but the economicmagic aspects are currently much more on his mind

 Literally supply graph in Baseline using the inflection of the word graph which implies that while ultimately causal and hence acyclic when unrolled over time the graph is highly cyclic when its inter time slice dependencies are projected onto a single time slice If you said the literal words supply chain in front of a dath ilani theyd do a double take and ask what the ass kind of supply graph looks like a chain

About half of the research harem has trickled back into the library they have their spellbooks out and are negotiating trades of spells now that theres all this spellbook ink available Its expensive enough that no student has ever had half as much as she wants but not so expensive that Keltham wouldnt find it deeply weird if his research harem didnt have enough of it so now they do

Ione is there too of course She looks neutral Nothing she could possibly put on her expression is anything that should be on her expression

Hi all So Ive been thinking about ways to teach me magic before I get magic goggles and among my potential stupid ideas is if anybody can both see magic and create a visible illusion that follows whatever magic does Though uh Im thinking I should try things the completely normal way before I try anything more complicated than that So whats the normal way of casting ones first spell

The normal way is that you visualize it from the sketches in the textbook and spend a while meditating and trying to get a feel for the fact theres magic at your fingertips and then you do things with it and get told what happened when you made that motion and then you try to get it to shape into a cantrip Which often takes weeks but not always if youre really smart and have prior exposure to magic

All right lets try this the most direct possible way Keltham internally contains a Read Magic cantrip and can feel the structure which looks the same as the sketches in the textbook Thats useful for the visualization part Keltham will then meditate and try to feel magic at his fingertips like when he cast Resistance and Greater Detect Magic and the truth spell before he was paying attention as he holds his hand over a copy of Read Magic built up over somebody elses spellbook He will try doing things with any magic he thinks he might be feeling and be told what if anything happened when he made a motion

Possible hypotheses to distinguish include

 Keltham as a being of dath ilan untouched by gods will prove to have zero magical aptitude and unable to affect the magic in any way Seems unlikely if hes a cleric and cleric spells look the same as wizard spells
 Keltham will have unworkably low wizard aptitude as a result of coming from a heritage that has never selected on itself at all for facility with wizardry
 Keltham having not come from a heritage in which wizards have had more access to contraception for however many generations will do great at this
 Keltham having the mighty mental disciplines of dath ilan at his disposal and having played a fair number of subtle perceptual computer games will do great at this for reasons having nothing to do with genetics
 Keltham will make a perfectly normal amount of progress for a Golarionite cleric with 18 Intelligence and zero prior magical exposure
 The first ten minutes of testing will not be enough to distinguish any of these hypotheses because theyre going to initially produce flat failure and that wouldve been true for any realistic sort of human being

Keltham can feel magic at his fingertips same as anyone when hes touching someone elses spell scaffold It feels like holding your hand near a flame except instead of heat his fingertips report the sensation of being dipped in honey

The first ten minutes do not distinguish any of the other hypotheses because yeah you cant get it in ten minutes 

Ive heard the record is half an hour says Meritxell 

I heard it took Nefreti Clepati an hour

She was eight though I think the records are people starting older like Keltham

Do you know which part of this is the critical step the one thats time bound for most people Being able to manipulate the magic being able to manipulate it predictably being able to manipulate it precisely being able to manipulate it fast enough being able to perceive the magic well enough to change manipulations in response to how the magic is changing being able to remember the shape 

I think closest to being able to perceive it well enough to change manipulations in response to how the magic is changing once youre competent with the very very basics you end up usually blocked on figuring out the order of operations that lets you build a stable structure and holding it all in your head at once while you execute on it but I think when youre learning the very basics the spells too simple for that to be hard and you mostly screw up by overcorrecting when its a little out of line thinking its still working when its not poking it in a bad place because you dont know whats going on so youre fumbling around 

All right Ill try focusing on perception Is this a case where the standard advice to just meditate and learn to sense things is as good as it gets because people tried to tweak the instructions and couldnt get them to work any better Or should I be trying to apply standard principles like forming hypotheses with my eyes closed guessing and opening my eyes to see someones illusion of what happened

Peopleve tried different ways of teaching it but they also wouldnt have been trying that hard at making it take an hour rather than five for bright students childrens time isnt worth very much

My time may not be worth that much either if how fast I learn wizardry isnt a bottleneck on any critical path which I suspect it wont be but Im also standing in a room full of potential experimenters So like why not you know Is my clever idea of an illusion trick something we can try Oh language note the Baseline idiom for clever idea carries the connotation that clever ideas often arent

I would say brilliant idea to carry that connotation Meritxell says Theres no reason not to try the illusion but we cant see magic and maintain a separate spell at the same time wed just have to show you after the fact

Sounds like itd burn through illusion spells fast if you lost the illusion spell each time you used the Detect Magic cantrip again How many illusion spells here do we have prepped that yall have spare to spend on brilliant ideas

Most of the students have an illusion spell prepped and some have two which amounts to 12 of them

All right lets plan to only spend half of those 12 in case Ive got even more brilliant ideas later Lets try cycle one of that attempted manipulation followed by perception Meritxell youre up first

Carissa remembers to slow down and take a deep breath before she rounds the corner that leads to the library If she comes running in looking like something intensely confusing and life changing just happens then if she were the kind of person who even might do that then Asmodeus wouldve had nothing to say to her She slows down and rounds the corner at the brisk walk of someone who is late but doesnt mind that much but does intend to get where shes going

If Carissa had come from another place a place with wristwatches where people more commonly checked the time she might have realized that in just a few more minutes it would be exactly the same time of day as when she had first run into Keltham yesterday at the Worldwound

And she might have worried 

That 

Not enough interesting things had happened to her over the last 24 hours

Just coming out of invisibility heading away from the library are a man and a woman The man is pale thin tall clad in simple tight black robes with red trim with a magical looking mace belted at his side He wears a cheerful joking grin the sort that might seem genuinely humorous to anyone outside of Cheliax who had never been to Cheliax or met anyone from Cheliax Hes attractive in a way that requires at least 18 Charisma and radiates a dark male magnetism which promises that while this man will definitely kill you once hes finished with you he will show you quite a good time first

Beside him is a taller and paler and older woman in elaborate layered dress black with wide red fringes and tassels themselves ornamented in gold and rubies with a horned crown on her head wrought of twisted platinum

She is identifiable to any informed Chelish citizen as a personage second only to Her Infernal Majestrix Abrogail Thrune II on the list of people who could have everyone in this building killed on a whim Aspexia Rugatonn the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus

Carissa kneels immediately before she has actually thought all the way through questions like what is she doing here and what am I doing here and am I sure thats her and did she talk to Keltham which seems like the kind of thing that wouldve been a disaster but she must be here to talk to Keltham why else 

 well maybe just to lay the Forbiddance Forbiddance is permanent and can only be dispelled by a more powerful caster which is to say if the Grand High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonn cast it that it cant be 

 Carissa has recently concluded that she needs to get more ambitious that being small isnt safe anymore but she still dearly hopes as she kneels that Grand High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonns business here has absolutely nothing to do with her

Aspexia Rugatonn Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus measures the woman kneeling before her with a careful eye and a half dozen magics If Carissa Sevar is an exceptional woman in ways beyond a native talent for wizardry this is not yet evident But then if Sevar was that self evidently extraordinary shed have been fast tracked more than she was

There are not many times when Asmodeus intervenes directly in Cheliax Aspexia prefers not to be ignorant about any of them She is knowledgeable of history and secrets though and so less confused by this intervention than others might be While other possible readings exist the degree to which Church and Queen have been ordered not to take the initiative in originating actions impinging on Carissa Sevar are suggestive of circumstances having triggered some divine compact to which Asmodeus is signatory The divine view of reality and negotiation gives more prominence than mortals do to notions of leaving things alone to become as they would otherwise have been perhaps because gods have been able to formulate a sensible notion of what that means between themselves where mortals could not

An obvious further guess is that this compacts signatories include Irori among their number and that Asmodeus is contesting with Irori for Carissa Sevars soul in some ancient challenge governed by rules Though if Carissa Sevar is wavering between Lawful Neutrality and Lawful Evil Asmodeus is being unsubtle in His blandishments the temptations more seem like inducements that would be offered to a soul already standing on Asmodean ground not a soul wavering between a choice of paths Overt blandishments for a soul to set proudly aside while being more covertly tempted by a sense of being treated as important and valuable Perhaps Carissa Sevars eidetically reported reaction seems not particularly expected of a nascent follower of Irori but that could be a masquerade Sevar has not been mindread more than she would be otherwise they are not to be proactive about her correction

Someone else in Aspexias position might wonder whether Asmodeus would be pleased if she disobeyed Asmodeuss orders in order to preemptively insinuate temptations to Sevar show her how important she could be before Sevar had sought out theological instruction of her own accord Such actions on a mortals initiative would not could not cause Asmodeus to be in direct violation of divine compact

Aspexia does not even consider it One of the foremost ways in which a Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus is shaped is to predictably not behave in ways that make it more expensive for Asmodeus to keep His compacts Improvising circles around your orders can rather tend do that If Aspexia was the kind of priestess to circumvent her orders Asmodeus would have needed to take that nature into account in choosing her orders 

More importantly when you are Asmodeuss priestess the first and foremost thing you do is what Asmodeus has told you to do

In the situation as Aspexia Rugatonn mostly suspects it to be a contest triggered between Asmodeus and Irori there are many words that could be spoken to Carissa Sevar to benefit Asmodeus There is a beastly fleshly impulse that wants to find some excuse to maneuver Carissa into asking for instruction to arrange the situation so that Carissa Sevar chooses to seek her descent into darkness to win herself the challenge against Irori to Asmodeuss glory

There is not the slightest chance that Aspexia Rugatonn will skirt the rules to try any of that Shes been told not to be proactive and that is a plain instruction hands off dont speak to Sevar unless spoken to Sevar is to cast aside her own will and not have it stripped from her One of the many glorious benefits of being an Asmodean is that you can just follow orders

There are also other possibilities for why her Lord would have instructed them so Sevars soul may have had hidden value great enough that trying to exchange it for permanent arcane sight would have been too unbalanced a trade and failed and Asmodeus may not have wished this fact revealed to Sevar herself Or Asmodeus may have some incomprehensible preference about this particular soul it may have some ancient shape sentimental to Him for which reason Asmodeus desires Carissa Sevar to come to Him in Hell and put aside her will of her own accord There may be some benign process underway which would be interfered with by Sevar gaining arcane sight and interfered with by other actions natural to Chelish agencies which Asmodeus desires to be left alone to proceed to its foreseeable outcome

Or there may be many things going on at once many pots that Asmodeus has in the fire that His orders impact simultaneously

By simply obeying her orders and not improvising Aspexia can avoid interfering with her Lords plans in any of those cases

Some of the apparent confusion of these orders may be due to how Hell rendered down Asmodeuss will into words Asmodeuss thoughts are too great for mortals to know and reflect truths unspeakable in this world under divine compacts Having those thoughts pass through a succession of devils each younger and stupider and less bound by the compacts than the last does not in any way surpass this fundamental barrier between start and finish and if this were not so all of Asmodeuss instructions would be passed by way of Hell Then any process by which Hell tries to translate Asmodeuss thoughts into mortal language must inevitably change and indeed mutilate those thoughts There are both advantages and disadvantages of that process compared to a direct divine revelation On the one hand there are wiser devils in Hell to oversee the initial stages of translation but on the other hand by the time the final words are heard they are stripped of other overtones that mortals could hear directly in a gods voice

An apparently important subtlety of Hells phrasing seemingly key to a puzzle may stem only from some devil phrasing something poorly and not foreseeing what a mortal would make of it This is yet another reason to just follow Hells commands without trying to brilliantly improvise around the fine edges of their exact details when Hell has interpreted Asmodeuss will into mortal language the commands edges may not have been placed that finely

Aspexia Rugatonn has gotten this far in life by combining the executive capacity to manage fractious subordinates plus great initiative and independence and ambition of her own plus the cruel and tyrannical disposition to be a priestess of Asmodeus with a genuinely intuitive understanding of why it can sometimes be a good idea to just follow your orders Her ascendance to the peak of Asmodeuss church can be seen as inevitable since theres only a billion or so people in Golarion and it is unlikely enough that even a single person like Aspexia Rugatonn came to exist there let alone two She worries about what will happen to her carefully crafted church after she dies

Oh and theres also the fact that this entire affair has now been the subject of two direct interventions of Asmodeus four cleric circles bestowed from Abadar two oracle circles from Nethys possibly something to do with Irori and two oracle circles from yet another unidentified Lawful Neutral god still under investigation In retrospect Aspexia really should have put up the Forbiddance first thing in the morning no matter what else was on her schedule

It would be genuinely arrogant under those circumstances for Aspexia to imagine that she knows precisely what is going on and can plan precise dances around it Thankfully in this case Asmodeus has given her orders by way of Hell which she can follow

So Aspexia knows exactly indeed trivially what she plans to say to Sevar Aspexia plans to say what Asmodeuss orders call for her to say

The man speaks Carissa Sevar I am Rathus Ratarion Paraduke under Her Infernal Majestrix If and only if you are not urgently about our Lords other business the Most High bids you walk with myself and her while she goes about casting a Forbiddance upon this place If you have theological questions do not speak them to her The Most High would not usually be the one to instruct a fourth circle cleric which is the precise fashion in which our Lord has commanded us to treat you and as the Most High has approached you here such instruction would not be sought of your own accord as Asmodeus has also commanded us regarding you

Carissa stands and falls in behind the both of them and is slightly impressed with herself for managing to do even that gracefully internally she is shaking She wonders if there is a fashion of instructing students that imbues them with sufficient awe in their superiors without leaving them somewhat debiliatingly terrified in their actual presence perhaps awe and terror go together inevitably but if any place had decoupled them dath ilan would have And Keltham wasnt frightened by Contessa Lrilatha though objectively speaking he should have been and perhaps that was just an error 

Who would ordinarily instruct a fourth circle cleric she asks the man once shes sure that her voice will convey at least no less dignity than an average Chelish wizard manages

A fifth circle cleric or higher depending on the question the senior cleric stationed here should suffice for many such There are questions that would naturally be referred from them to the Most High A slight hesitation But I should not I think attempt to insinuate what those questions would be while you stand in the Most Highs presence not sought of your own accord You might be led into asking those questions and that would constitute our being proactive which our Lord has been very clear we should not be I believe that I should come quickly to our business here Sevar and reduce my risks of accidentally being proactive

Aspexia Rugatonn strides briskly ahead of both of them but not fast enough that it would be strenuous for the other two to follow Its plausible that she intends to make a quick circuit of the entire grounds perhaps for purposes of Forbiddance

Carissa keeps pace 

It seems likely that she is being reprimanded If she had been proactive and sought out the senior cleric stationed here then Asmodeus could have delivered whatever instruction He intended 

 except He could do that anyway right 

 well He said to seek it out proactively and she hasnt done that yet so if its a test she failed which is terrifying except also it has been less than an hour and she spent the entire time reflecting on what questions she was going to ask so as to do the job properly Shes not complaining even internally that it is unfair for her to have failed the test the test is whether shes useful or not and theres no fairness in that No one shopping at the market and picking over vegetables leaving out the bruised ones worries that those ones arent getting a fair shot But it seems like the test isnt necessarily discriminating very well if spending an hour thinking through what youre going to ask before asking is failing it

So possibly she is not being reprimanded Evidence for this theory she isnt in even a little bit of pain Possibly she is just being because its very unlikely that the offer to walk with Aspexia Rugatonn was extended without specific intent reminded of what it means to be raised high in this world by Asmodeus reminded of what she has been offered if she is good enough

And possibly she is being evaluated Actually that shouldnt have come to mind third Asmodeus bothered with her this is confusing possibly it is confusing even to Aspexia Rugatonn and she wants to know whether it is some specific feature of Carissa as a person which prompted the offer or whether it was effectively offered to the girl who got in with Keltham fastest on the assumption all of them would be minimally competent from there that doesnt quite fit but she doesnt have a better theory to replace it with 

 well if it was something specific about Carissa the only thing she can think of the only thing that felt like a thought pattern no one else in Cheliax had thought before was the question she was puzzling over during Kelthams lesson about how to reconcile dath ilans teachings of law and chaos and heredity and humans having been copied rather than created and what free will is Her going interpretation she thinks vaguely of Asmodeuss message was that she was being too Lawful Neutral she was going to reconstruct it all and arrive at the wrong place She is grateful for the warning and intends to take it to heart and wont try again until shes better at Evil But presumably Asmodeus wouldnt have said anything just to save her from becoming a heretic and dying of it so it must be important in some way outside her maybe if she gets it right she can convince Keltham Thats probably her top guess if she had to name one Whats confusing about it whats the strongest argument against it well if a really good theologian was projected to succeed at convincing Keltham theyd have gotten a theologian in to do it thats a little confusing

First I am to deliver this copy from the eidetic memory of Elias Abarco of the complete event It includes Elias Abarcos report of the precise words of all instructions from Hell Any clear errors or omissions in Eliass report which appear to you are extremely serious affairs and are to be reported to us at once if you are doubtful report your doubts accurately and magic to clarify your memory will be provided you Once you touch this paper it will become readable only by you barring great magics Report nonetheless if it is stolen or as a clever spy might arrange apparently lost due to your own carelessness under very embarrassing circumstances that you are sorely tempted to keep secret It may be destroyed by burning at your own discretion though I would suggest being very certain you have perfectly memorized Hells conveyed instructions before doing so

Paraduke Rathus Ratarion hands Carissa a paper written in very precise very clear handwriting containing to all appearances a complete and accurate transcript of the entire event including the part where she threatened to eat the devils heart and everything she said to Elias Abarco afterwards about wanting to be pretty and the rest of that

The thing shes tempted to say is thank you as if its a favor she restrains herself It is a very valuable thing to her but thats got nothing to do with why it was handed to her this is sacred material a communication very distantly from Asmodeus himself and it ought to be correct as their duty to Him She reads through it This matches my recollection on a first review

Good There remains then the matter of your first set of requests for Chelish state support in your indulgences a matter in which I have been deemed the person best suited to make decisions I have come to a preliminary decision on all of your requests here

Carissa glances back down at the paper to be entirely sure what she said

Im going to need to be prettier Every counts heir Ive ever seen was stunningly beautiful Dont you dare comment on my looks Ill stab you Im going to need to be prettier And I want a headband and an allowance for crafting

I dont actually know how much the inheriting daughter of a Count of I mean presumably they get their allowance from their county which you havent got 

Well maybe you should get me one

Is this what gratitude for the extraordinary indulgence of your god looks like

Gratitude He wants a return And Im going to be perfect can I have the other girls souls

Wow She really did say that Shes still not in pain so shes going to conclude she doesnt regret it at all Yet

They are now outside and circling briskly about the grounds paths through moderately pretty gardens with an unusual number of red and black flowers going to near where fences and defenses begin Aspexia is frowning not at Carissa but with a surveyors eye suggesting that she is considering where to place the borders of her Forbiddance in a place convenient to moving some of the defenses inward

The Paraduke continues speaking

There exists a tension between two elements of Hells interpretation given to us of Asmodeuss will which is a hazard of Hell interpreting and distorting Asmodeuss will into such commands as may be spoken in language to mortals We are on the one hand to reward you no less and no more than you have earned under Asmodeuss Law On the other hand to support you as though you were an inheriting daughter of a Countess if you seek to indulge

Interpreting and resolving such tensions in Asmodeuss direct interventions conveyed by way of Hell is ordinarily business of the Most High Aspexia Rugatonn It is in this capacity that she is overseeing my own interactions with you now in case I make any errors in my interpretation while she had other business about this place

To all appearances Paraduke Rathus Ratarion seems entirely unbothered by the prospect of needing to execute confusing instructions from Asmodeus by way of Hell with the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus watching him in case he requires correction Perhaps he is in fact unbothered by it This is unlikely to be among the hundred most stressful days of his life

The Most High currently believes we are to resolve the tension in our instructions thus reason as if you were the inheriting daughter of a Count of Cheliax and decide your requests as though we were being asked what treatment of an inheriting daughter would be a matter of concern according to the principles of Her Infernal Majestrixs reign

In regards to your request to seem more comely if an heiress of a Count was being forced to grow up with an ordinary appearance it would be a non Asmodean behavior of small but noticeable concern to Church and Queen If the pattern was repeated or if it was done with deliberate attempt to prevent that heiress from indulging in vanity it would become a matter of greater concern

In such an event I Paraduke Rathus Ratarion minister over the Asmodean culture of the nobility under Her Infernal Majestrix would be dispatched by the Majestrix to speak to this hypothetical Count inquire into any hidden reasons and perhaps suggest a correction In this case the Count in question does not exist and so the Count may be considered to have mounted no counterargument and yielded the issue This statement is accompanied very briefly by that humorous grin which might look genuine to anyone whod never been to Cheliax

A wizard potionmaker pair that has recently treated county heiresses has been located and you will be conveyed there tomorrow for your first treatment After dinner time tomorrow which given your reported schedule seemed least likely to cause you to miss any important lectures from the person that Hell referred to as your teacher Despite the general importance and urgency of obeying Asmodeuss commands I ruled out having it done at once since the inheriting daughter of a Count would not have someone elses appointment canceled for her to accommodate her the same day as she made the request

I will not ask if this is to your satisfaction as a county heiress would not be so asked by myself Nor is it appropriate for you to express gratitude towards me I am not granting you favors I am conversing with a hypothetical parent of yours regarding which indulgences are deemed a positive sign in a young Asmodean noble and Her Infernal Majestrixs state is then acting in that absent Counts capacity using such resources as a Count would allocate

If any of this process and reasoning seems less than completely understandable to you speak now as it concerns Asmodeuss commands and hence is of great importance to clarify I may not be present here in person to interact with you in the future

See they are more like Keltham than normal people theyd make more sense to him Contessa Lrilatha did but she was trying to so that wasnt much evidence but this man too would make sense to Keltham there is a truth that both of them are climbing towards only dath ilan doesnt have gods to guide them towards it and does have a billion people with an average INT of 18 working on it 

To Keltham she would say I think I understand because she suspects Keltham values apparent effort towards acknowledging her own errancy towards admitting that this is not the sort of set of sentences which one would rightly be perfectly sure they understand but this is Cheliax Her errancy is accounted for I understand she says only because its quicker than the pause hed give for her to admit confusions if she had any

After careful consideration I have made a preliminary ruling that your request for an intelligence increasing headband and for a crafting allowance seems to me to come less under the heading of a desire to indulge in Asmodean behavior befitting young nobility and more under the heading of your requesting a reward not yet earned If the inheriting daughter of a Count were told to produce results meriting an intelligence headband and crafting allowance or else go without the Church and Queen would not object

I would not hand you title to the souls of your rival women even if I could While the goal is laudably Asmodean it is not one which should be immediately satisfied in a Counts heiress as an indulgence It would be more proper for her parent to instruct her to triumph over her rivals herself

The request for a county is intriguing and perhaps even arguably indulgent but it seems to stretch the interpretation of the wording for prioritizing you as if you were an heiress and to be too much of an unearned reward While it was an admirably Asmodean ploy I put forth on behalf of Her Infernal Majestrix and the Most High agreed that if such had been our Lords true will Hells interpretation would have said to make you an heiress not to prioritize your support as though you were one We were sensible of course that you were likely just teasing poor Elias with that request but Asmodeuss orders to us do not actually say that it matters Another cheerful appearing humorous appearing smile which vanishes just as quickly as before

You will receive by tomorrows evening a lightly enchanted dueling dagger whose wounds heal more easily but which causes greater pain It will be simple in style but suitable for a Counts heiress to carry and would be appropriate for her to use to stab somebody who commented on her appearance

You are permitted to argue these preliminary rulings especially by reference to implications of Asmodeuss interpreted instructions which I may have failed to comprehend Do you wish to do so

No She is not very surprised to learn that she cannot have a headband a crafting allowance a county and the souls of her rivals just because Asmodeus said something that got translated down as that she should be somewhat indulged How should I make my requests of the Cheliax government acting in the stead of my Count in the future

This location reports daily to both Church and Crown or is intended to do so once it has stopped generating an additional top urgency report every hour as presently seems to be the case If your request is not more urgent than that which a Counts heirs request ordinarily would not be there should be a cleric on site who is responsible for maintaining communication direct your messages to them or have a report delivered to them for forwarding to my own office

 nod The other girls who sell their souls are going to have permanent arcane sight It would be unsuitable I think for a Counts inheriting daughter to be studying magic with a peer group all of whom had such a substantial advantage she did not

The man smiles drolly Hardly an indulgence in darkness Sevar It also seems unwise for us to attempt to undo one of the most direct effects of our Lords unexplained actions It is possible that a critical point in this entire affair is that everyone with arcane sight here will be fooled by some trick or illusion which only you will successfully resist Though that is less probable today than it would have been historically when prophecy was unbroken and the gods commands more often had such effects And if you do enough to merit the loan of an item enchanted for magical detection or arcane sight it will be loaned to you as Asmodeus commanded us to reward you no less than you had earned The Most High is fond of regularly pointing out how much our lives can be simplified by just following Asmodeuss commands precisely

Theyve completed the circuit of the villa The Grand High Priestess halts her strides and makes a silencing gesture then takes an incense burner out of her dresss folds followed by enough incense that if you have any sense for the grade of incense shes using it is going to constitute a significant part of the Chelish governments expenses for today

From a wizards perspective this cleric spell takes her a shockingly short time to cast for a ritual of that expense and permanent effect Its over in less than a minute an extremely smoky and fragrant one

When its done the Paraduke speaks again This affair is confusing Some might even say alarming Our Lord did not forbid us from questioning you about it The instructions we did receive however imply a generally high degree of caution The Most High has guessed that if we would otherwise press you with questions our Lord would probably have needed to command us not to do it given the character of His other commands By avoiding pressing you with questions then we can perhaps have saved our Lord some cost and space for other instruction

With that said if there is anything you want to say about this whole affair the Most High wants to hear it But you must not treat that truth as a command from the Most High If that were predictably the way you behaved Asmodeus might have needed to expend greater costs to tell the Most High not to appear before you and listen silently to you if that is something she should not do

In thinking this way the Most High instructs us we are to ignore entirely the fact that Asmodeus has already acted We are not to reason in any way that includes the fact that Asmodeus has already omitted to instruct us to avoid questions We must still act to avoid wasting our Lords time and energy even now that it has already been spent because His own sight spans time and our own actions in a way that our mortal perspectives do not We have been cursed with free will but we can choose not to use it and make ourselves predictable instead

I can barely understand the matter myself but the Most High understands it better and it is she who instructs This opportunity to speak must not be taken by you as a veiled order from the Most High

If however there is anything you want to say about this entire affair the Most High Aspexia Rugatonn bids me say to you in her presence that should you have received other revelations from Asmodeus or know of other relevant facts rendering this affair more understandable she has not deduced on her own part that Asmodeus intended her not to hear of it

And maybe they arent reading her mind if that would entail being proactive Its bizarre to think they might not have been and she doesnt intend to put any weight on it but but maybe shes going to have to say her speculation aloud if she wants it known by her superiors without the plausible deniability about whether she thought it worth bringing to their attention

Asmodeus has not otherwise communicated with me she says I if I had to guess why me my best guess was during Kelthams lessons I was trying to work out a reconciliation of the things dath ilan knows about how humans came to be and how they learn and in what arenas they can learn the patterns gods run on with theology as it was taught to me And I think the instructions were perhaps aimed at me doing that right rather than how I was doing it which was too Lawful Neutral

Paraduke Rathus Ratarion now has additional questions He opens his mouth to ask albeit more subtly and gently than he usually would exactly what new theology Sevar thinks she was inventing that would merit direct correction and encouragement from Asmodeus Himself rather than from her superiors

Tread carefully Aspexia Rugatonn sends across their open Telepathy bond tinging her thoughts with just enough coldness and hints of the lash to remind the Paraduke to be concerned with his continuing possession of his skin and not just his curiosity or indignation Say nothing proactively that this frightened child might possibly take as a hint of correction

This sort of lunacy drives Aspexia Rugatonn completely up the wall What if this child did in fact stumble over some thought that the current priesthood of Asmodeus would not have thought on their own and Asmodeus was trying to correct and encourage her in that Wouldnt they have received orders very similar to the ones Asmodeus gave them Why is this Paraduke trying to make Asmodeuss life more difficult in possible cases like that one Yes whats going on is more likely that Sevar thought something so Lawful Neutral that it triggered an old compact between Asmodeus and Irori but if thats whats actually happening then it is beneficial for Asmodeus that Sevar seems to believe shes being encouraged to work on a more Lawful Evil theology A beneficial delusion which in that possible case they can avoid disturbing by following their orders

Ratarion doesnt show any hint of a wince outside but after a moments thought he realizes what he probably did wrong Yes if theres some contest between Irori and Asmodeus going on Sevar should not be snapped out of any delusions she has about inventing her own theology so long as its a Lawful Evil one

Automatically Ratarion now opens his mouth again now with the intent of saying to Sevar that the Most High would no doubt find it interesting to hear of any thought which merited Asmodeuss direct attention 

Stop Stop being proactive Stop showing initiative to help our Lord accomplish His goals after He gave you more specific instructions than that Just obey in a way our Lord would have found predictable

Aspexia Rugatonn sometimes permits herself the vanity of thinking that she has come to understand a tiny bit of Asmodeuss divine frustration No matter what orders Asmodeus gives there is always some part of mortals even of her but she is managing it better that thinks obedience means treating Asmodeuss orders as constraints or worse hints as to what Asmodeus is really trying to do by which means the mortal can helpfully understand what Asmodeus is really trying to do and then cleverly navigate around the edges of Asmodeuss order constraints to accomplish that better

Aspexia has tried telling other people that they need to become more the sorts of beings that Asmodeus can easily and safely steer using brief instructions It doesnt seem to help Nobody other than her ever gets it She is speaking some word that is not in the innate language of their being

Aspexia once devised the parable of a three year old child whose owner must instruct it to navigate it through a dungeon full of traps using a limited budget of words To teach her student clerics how the world must look from Asmodeuss perspective To make them ask themselves how much theyd want the child to plainly follow direct orders where it got those versus showing creative initiative for all the cases its orders didnt seem to cover versus responding quickly to the unexpected versus the child trying to deduce what its orders really meant and going the extra mile on its owners inferred goals

The parable didnt work so she requisitioned access to a dungeon and bought some three year olds and tried making her clerics actually run the exercise So they could see what happened when the three year old acted towards them like they were acting towards Asmodeus

It still didnt help There seems to be something about the concept that is contrary to the nature of a mortal soul Mortals just end up with goals even if you tell them to take Asmodeuss goals as their own they still end up with goals mortals dont just obey they end up with a goal of obedience and then they start trying to figure out how to dance around the edges of Asmodeuss instructions so they can obey Him even more Aspexia can see what theyre doing wrong but she has never been able to successfully get that concept inside of a fellow mortal She can talk it at her flock but theyre still mortals after shes done talking The training games shes devised didnt seem to help much outside of the specific games themselves The way that a mortal should obey the way that a distant god who cant communicate clearly and doesnt have much time to think about them would want them to obey corrigibility she once tried naming it to her flock its just so alien to a mortals nature

Aspexia Rugatonn sometimes permits herself the vanity of thinking that she has come to understand a tiny bit of her own owners frustration

While I imagine the Most High is curious about specifics Ratarion says a few moments later if you would like any manner of theological instruction with respect to your ideas I believe our Lords orders imply that the senior cleric at your installation would be the one to converse with and they could also pass a report to the Most High not intended for any further correction Alternatively if you do not yet seek such instruction a report on your current thoughts not intended to seek any form of correction could be sent directly to the Most High A slight hesitation Though I believe the Most High would wish me to emphasize that neither of these are commands attempts to push around the edges of Asmodeuss probable orders regarding the degree to which we are not to be proactive if you spend time urgently composing such a report and miss a key lesson from your teacher if you focus your thoughts on the Most Highs reactions and pay less attention in class we would have perhaps managed to do a form of damage that Asmodeus would have need to give further orders to prevent you should not I am trying to suggest go too far out of the path you would otherwise take to file any report if it seems you would never have done that without us coming here and being proactive Ratarion does wince visibly this time and then emits a very charming smile Not being proactive really is quite hard for a mortal isnt it Perhaps I should simply be silent

If there were an agent here in my place which was smart enough they could imagine out a Carissa exactly as she stood an hour ago on her way to go to magic lessons with Keltham and the rest of his girls and project out when she would have sought correction and exactly how she would have clarified all the questions she was contemplating and so that Carissa could continue on her trajectory unimpeded by this conversation or any future ones that the things I might want to explain would necessitate and we could discuss all of the specifics while leaving that Carissa out of the loop so to speak to do precisely as she has been ordered

Im not that smart and Im not sure anyone is past the end of prophecy but theres a simpler approach of tracking down those impulses that this conversation might have unwisely insinuated into Carissa and choking them off and preserving myself in the state of one who has attracted no proactive interest whatsoever while still having told you everything useful I can I will try because it is my desire to be inexpensive for Asmodeus to direct and because it is my desire to get your advice without you being obliged by my inability to avoid following it to barely give it in the first place But I suspect my trying will be imperfect because I am not smart enough to contain a Carissa I am one 

I think a Count in this position would give his daughter a headband

This is what always happens when she tries to explain to her fellow mortals why they need to be easier to steer They start thinking even more complicated thoughts and inventing elaborate ways to be easier to steer that would involve doing even more things pursuing goals and even in this case increasing their intelligence Aspexia is not even angry anymore She is just numb

I believe we are approaching the point where our putative Count would find the heiresss insistence to be less adorable Sevar The senior officer at this installation would be an appropriate audience for any assertions by you that a headband would be necessary to your work 

Aspexia Rugatonn speaks out loud for the first time Hold she says in a clear cold voice I have received a message The Lawful Neutral god who bestowed two oracle circles has been identified It is Otolmens Have you been told who that is Sevar

Goddess of keeping the world intact 

I would under other circumstances regret having just completed this Forbiddance here which would make it more difficult and expensive to move this project to the other side of Golarion from Cheliax However any matter which merits Otolmenss attention is one which you cannot escape that easily and requires getting at least off the local plane

If this project had not been the subject of two direct interventions by Asmodeus and been created as a result of Asmodeuss intervention I would order the deaths of every person here except for Otolmenss oracle and hope that this had been sufficient

It is a sufficiently severe matter that I am now stating directly though still without direct threat or consequence otherwise that if you know anything I should know about this before I offer Asmodeus a further costly opportunity to guide me I believe that not only Asmodeus but every Lawful god and most non Lawful gods would prefer that you share it with me

Aspexia guesses though its a less certain guess than usual that if Asmodeus wanted her to not ask questions about a fucking Otolmens event then Asmodeus would have used His limited communications budget to communicate that to her directly

Its got to be about Keltham Am I the only person who has read his mind or did someone else get in on that before he got clericed and it became risky or have you got an expensive way to do it anyway I think its worth it 

Ignore any channels you think I may have for receiving information about Keltham other than yourself including your own past reports Speak to me as if Id never heard of the man explain to me why Otolmens is acting

Keltham is from a world with an average intelligence of 18 and a billion people well coordinated They are richer than us and have invented many things we havent which should nonetheless function in our world some underlying laws being the same He has patterns of thought that Im pretty sure dont occur on Golarion at all hes just better at thinking hes not smarter than me but its like hes half overcome the curse of having a mortal brain through deliberate practice and he thinks of himself as very weak at it compared to a dath ilani with an aptitude and hes trying to teach us They have dangerous ideas and dangerous inventions which arent known to Keltham held by Keepers but probably possible to derive independently and Keltham doesnt know how they handle people who derive them or which things he shouldnt reinvent Lrilatha warned him about that They screened off their entire history because there was something dangerous in it

Aspexia thinks The more thoughts of her own she has so long as she holds them lightly the easier it will be for Asmodeus to point to any of them if any of them are correct If indeed this matter merits Asmodeuss attention at all It could be that Nethys and Otolmens have some rivalry after the fashion of more ordinary gods Nethys dropping two oracle circles followed by Otolmens responding with two oracle circles is suggestive of that It could be that there is some more ordinary divine game going on and not the world ending Asmodeus isnt acting like the world is ending and Abadar shouldnt be dropping four cleric circles on somebody whos going to end it

Aspexia spares a moment of frustration for how it is impossible for consecrations forbiddances wardings or literally anything else to keep Nethys out of anything Ordering Nethyss oracle killed and maledicted would be an obvious tactic but Nethyss oracle seems like she might be harder than usual to maledict or even take out of her library Which means that Nethys was thinking about Chelish responses not just being insane And if they kill Ione Sala and Nethyss clerics resurrect her then Nethyss clerics may find out whats going on here with Keltham if they dont already know

I will soon pray to Asmodeus My default intention which Asmodeus may choose not to correct will be to equip Otolmenss oracle with invisibility items and a weapon and permit him to monitor and intervene in events in this facility as he wishes He will have pointed out to him Keltham and Ione Sala she is now allegedly against her own will an oracle of Nethys if you had not been informed of that as possible objects of his attention Do you Sevar wish to offer any corrections however slight to my default plan

I think Keltham would agree to put all his teaching on hold indefinitely if you told him Otolmens oracled someone which you could do in addition to empowering the oracle if you expect to have better options to present Asmodeus later

Aspexia does not scream at Sevar about how causing every single intervention of a god to have lots and lots of different effects is not always helpful to that god Its not that Aspexia would balk at screaming this repeatedly at somebody while burning off their fingers and healing them back its that shes found doing so doesnt help

Otolmenss existence is considered a secret because of how we do not wish to direct more attention to Her domain It is more in accord with usual policy surrounding Otolmens to not call this matter to Kelthams attention and potentially turn his thoughts in that direction

This policy is not mostly about the chance that Keltham will act deliberately Sevar The problem lies in turning peoples thoughts in a direction calling their attention to the harmful thing If you tell someone that Otolmens worries they might destroy the world they may ask themselves how theyd do that or ask themselves why theyd do that I would ordinarily just kill and maledict him but Asmodeus told us not to do that and also Abadar has made the man His cleric It is a frustrating situation to be in and in those situations it is often wiser to do less than to do more if you have not been instructed otherwise Says the three year old in the dungeon and lives a little longer

With that said would you recommend moderately strongly especially if your recommendation is based on information not known to me that I come before Asmodeus with a default policy of warning Keltham explicitly

No Maybe dath ilan has categorically adequate training in how to take that information and not make things worse with it not think about all the implications or the likely mechanisms It would not be surprising if dath ilan did But Keltham hasnt directly said it does and her argument seems obviously true of Golarion people who are worse

If you come across any further information on this Otolmens event which you think is relevant standard protocols call for you to report it separately to the highest priest and senior military officer of this installation to be separately reported to myself and Her Infernal Majestrix You are not to assume that any such information has been reported by other channels duplicate it Follow these instructions unless you are quite sure that your other instructions from Hell or Asmodeus supersede them

I understand

Im going to go talk to Otolmenss oracle then pray Do you consider it necessary to insert yourself into that discussion

What kind of person no broader than that what kind of mind of any kind would answer yes to that question No Priestess

Aspexia flies off toward the villa at speeds only slightly visually distinguishable from teleportation

I believe I shall see myself out says Paraduke Rathus Ratarion Enjoy your date Though that wasnt an order you know I think I should just go

He gives Sevar a cheerful wave walks just outside the Forbiddance and vanishes

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh shes not just being stubborn and childish about the headband she actually thinks that she is not capable enough to function at the level required for survival in her current situation and she doesnt really have a plan B well Plan B is to become as good at thinking as Keltham who is not smarter than her But itll take time that its not at all obvious she has 

She stands up Walks back inside Tries to contemplate the odds that Asmodeus will after all tell Aspexia Rugatonn sure kill them all 

Halfling slave 958245 Broom has never heard of Otolmens which was obviously going to be true in retrospect and doesnt know what this whole project is about which was also obviously going to be true in retrospect and doesnt have much of an education of course and has not received any helpful revelations from a primordial inevitable who would have a harder time talking to him than even Asmodeus would of course and is having a hard time understanding what is even going on at all of course let alone why the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus would be trying to have a plainly spoken discussion with him of course and Aspexia could no doubt have foreseen this herself if shed spent an additional minute thinking about it in advance of course

Aspexia keeps her temper under absolute control When she gets home for the day if indeed she ever does get home for the day shes going to order a dozen slaves sent to her bask in their understandable fears for a while and then set all of them on fire

Why Why did Otolmens pick him Why halfling slave 958245

 because Broom is a simple predictable mortal who will do something predictable in the future if Aspexia had to guess

All right Aspexia will not modify her predictable initial plans unless Asmodeus tells her to Broom gets a greater invisibility ring and a dagger of assassination and what Aspexia hopes is exactly the right level of gentle suggestion not to kill random Asmodeans without a reason and that the reason is supposed to have something to do with his new god and Her purposes not just Brooms previous grudges 

Aspexia is glad that she doesnt have to work on this project or live in this villa but in fact she doesnt have to work on this project or live in this villa so everything is fine

Awww Asmodeuss favoritest pet squirrel in all of Golarion has been spooked by Otolmens hanging around To be fair to His pet squirrel this is literally among the most reasonable possible reasons for a pet squirrel to become spooked His pet squirrel is probably not deducing the context about how Otolmens freaks out every time the laws of physics do something She thinks they shouldnt like throwing out the anomaly squirrel and now She is hanging around Golarion being upset about that

He sends a faint nonsemantic touch of reassurance Gods are allowed to do this to their clerics without it being very costly from the intervention budget so long as they dont do it often enough or reliably enough that it starts to form a signaling code The part about making Otolmenss new oracle be invisible is weird and unpredicted but Asmodeus doesnt have time to pay much attention and His pet squirrel probably knows what its doing Its not worth an intervention almost certainly

Broom has spent a long lifetime looking and sounding and in some cases thinking exactly as wise and intelligent as will not get a slave punished under a variety of circumstances This usually does not call for very much apparent wisdom and intelligence it is better to let your masters look down on you when that does not give them a reason to punish you

When the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus explains matters to Broom using carefully dumbed down clauses about how hes been chosen by the goddess of preventing the world from ending and hes allowed to kill an Asmodean if he thinks it stops the world ending but shouldnt do so otherwise except that if he feels a very strong impulse to do anything he should probably do that whether or not it involves killing someone Broom displays exactly the level of apparent wisdom and intelligence that makes him look like a gruff old halfling sweeper who was in fact able to grasp all that and will do it reliably He thinks he understands mistress some people might make a world threatening mess that destroys not just Cheliax but all of Golarion and if it looks like theyre going to do that Broom will clean it up

Broom does not plan to do this as a masquerade or think any worded thoughts about it its just a reflex by now Like so many others in Cheliax Broom has become not a very distinguishable person from his mask even to himself It may not occur to Broom for a while yet that he is now allowed to be wiser or more intelligent than he previously needed to look to his masters

This too is mortal nature if you put someone in a position where they are not allowed to look too intelligent or wise and then take them out of it There is momentum but a finite momentum and it is hard to guess how far that momentum will last

Keltham has now guessed and then been shown what happens when he tries to touch magic on four different occasions Hes burned his remaining Greater Detect Magic for the day on watching what happens when other people interact with spells above scaffolds though he cant hold his concentration on Greater Detect Magic while trying his own magical manipulations and before his spell ran out he also took another look at people catching cantrips Hes not forming solid perceptual generalizations about what does what

But hes ever played hyperdimensional arcade games with lots of hidden information and subtlety

I get the impression that Detect Magic is not showing all of the latent information hidden facts about what goes on with magical structures Like two magical configurations that looked the same to me in the illusion youre showing me could have other different facts about them not visible in the illusion not visible in the detection spell which would change how the spell reacted when I touched it In particular I touched it what I thought was the same way twice and even though it seemed to have reset to the same starting point both times it reacted pretty differently Maybe I touched it differently which could be true obviously but going on general behaviors and my intuitive sense of the pattern I think that something changed in the hidden background Does that sound right

 maybe says Meritxell Magic is deterministic but the illusion probably isnt conveying enough to fully determine it if I touch it itll do what I want every time for something as simple as a cantrip but I dont know what additional features of the situation I might be paying attention to that Im not properly putting in the illusion For the kind of spell where it wont do what I want every time Id be failing to pay attention to its momentum properly or failing to pay attention to the viscosity it gets from having been recently manipulated or failing to track an interaction its having with other nearby magic but cantrips are so easy that you dont have to account for all of that

Deterministic and fully visible are different concepts and I maybe shouldnt have asked about them together Even if the parts I cant see are the same and I actually am touching them differently or those other parts are just reacting to changing things like viscosity are there parts I cant see in the information here I mean even changes of viscosity from having been recently manipulated implies theres a current viscosity state that isnt being shown are there a lot of other facts that can be true about it hidden information he uses the Baseline term because he just cant stand it latentvariables that Im not seeing

There are parts you cant see yes You have to infer their state though for a cantrip you dont have to infer it very precisely

Keltham is a very self disciplined person who would not set anything on fire right now even if he had the economicmagic to do that without buying a flamethrower

I realize this may not be the usual order in which these things are taught to children but can I just have a quick review of all the known equations or even rules of thumb governing all the properties that magic actually has Has any progress been made on getting a copy of any of the books like Principles of Spell Design I think was one of them that would have information like that

 they can try but all the known rules of thumb are not quick and all the equations are not known Principles of Spell Design lays out all of the heuristics you can use but you still usually fail when designing spells with all of those in mind its speculated that gods can see all the hidden properties exactly as clearly as the visible properties and thats why its not hard for gods to design spells 

They launch into all the known rules of thumb usually with the caveat that casting cantrips doesnt actually require this You can think of one aspect of magic as lagging the visible aspects like so requiring more energy to move and moving more slowly when it does but also requiring more energy to stop you can think of another as reacting badly to close contact with itself and resisting spell structures like such or such which is why no spells have structures like that you can think of this other thing as possible to tug into alignment only by sort of jiggling the spell and you can tell youve got it when you dont get any reverberations when you do this 

And people have of course tried hyperdimensional representations that capture all that but its hard and usually less useful to learn than the heuristics if you arent specifically doing spell design and none of them have arrived at equations that if solved for let you invent spells despite having headbands and plenty of motivation Its understood that the number of ways magic interacts with itself is just very very large for high circle spells and its not reducible complexity 

It is someone ventures sort of like the thing Keltham said about how knowing how objects move doesnt let you catch them in the air

No one has found Principles of Spell Design yet

Ione Sala has now realized two things

First she knows where theres a copy several copies in fact of Principles of Spell Design in the Ostenso wizard academys library

Second her oracles curse allows her to borrow copies of nonmagical books in general circulation from libraries Ione has already visited and spent time reading inside if shes been inside the part of the library that has those books Though its not teleportation and she cant use it to write messages back the books just temporarily disappear from their current libraries and temporary copies of them get created in her own library She thinks she can do five books per day at the current power circle is it a thing that has circles of her oracles curse and a borrow lasts for a day unless she expends one use on renewing it

Ione has the best curse ever

Its tempting to imagine that Nethys did that because she would have wanted it But thats pathetic Nethys isnt a Good god who would be thinking like that even if Goods own propaganda was true If she has this curse shes meant to use it for Nethyss benefit which so far as Ione can possibly guess means using it to push Kelthams research forwards

This is also going to make her a lot harder to replace with an imposter that can fool Keltham But that is not why she is doing this she is not trying to make Chelish securitys life more difficult for her own benefit Her god has given her an ability which is clearly meant to be used for the benefit of this important Chelish project that Cheliax is spending lots of money on and she is only going to use it for that She is completely not going to argue if Cheliax tells her to pretend that a book isnt there or cant be retrieved In fact shes going to lie to Keltham and say theres sometimes unpredictable exceptions in which books she can get specifically so Cheliax can order her not to get something and shell have an excuse She is a very good and obedient oracle of Nethys who doesnt want Chelish security to gouge her eye out again it was very unpleasant and Ione definitely feels very scared and threatened by that even if they cant destroy her the way Nethys can Even Nethys is clearly being somewhat cooperative since the inability to write any messages back is probably there to reassure Chelish security against information leaking out that way But it also wouldnt be the best possible service to Nethys to ask Chelish securitys permission to reveal this ability they might say no and that is clearly not Nethyss will here

Keltham wait a second Ione says out loud let me write you a note about something

She starts to scribble

I have a secret ability to borrow up to five ordinary books for a day each unless renewed if theyre in a part of a library that Ive been to Though theyre just temporary copies you cant write things in them permanently and there are weird exceptions about which books it works on I think for a project this important Ill accept if the other girls get suspicious I can do it or even if you just want me to announce outright that I had a secret like that Do you want me to get you Principles of Spell Design from the Ostenso academy library

Is security stopping her Shes really sorry about talking to Keltham first like that she really is she didnt do it to make their lives harder but she doesnt believe that Nethys would want her to offer Chelish security a veto on using her powers to help this important Chelish project at all which is how Nethys obviously intends them to be used for Cheliaxs benefit Nethys even made it not involve real teleportation there could be a pact about this between Nethys and Asmodeus for all they know Nethys obviously has an interest in Asmodeus succeeding here and shes very happy to not retrieve particular books in the future if Chelish security says so and she even lied to Keltham about that like a good obedient Nethys oracle should without anybody needing to tell her that please dont hurt her

Security is not stopping her though if a halfling were to stab her they would NOT BE SORRY just saying

Keltham gets the note

Keltham reads the note

Keltham stares into the air for several seconds

Yes please Keltham says

This is just so reminiscent of an ero LARP where the potential romantic interests all have special powers and Keltham accidentally hit on this girls unlock condition unreasonably early and now shes going along with the script and revealing some of her hidden story and offering him the scripted level of in game abilities and sexual access

Not that Keltham has ever had anything remotely like the money to pay for sex work on that level of course And hes not the sort to read the scripts for LARPs hes too poor to play as the protagonist But its such a trope to subvert and parody that its spawned entire massive genres of secondary literature some of which has become really good and famous and a topic of widespread discussion in its own right to the point that people whove never read a summary of a novel deconstructing the storylines of actual scripted longterm multiplayer sexwork nonetheless know all about the tropes for Capability Harems

Ione walks to the other room of the library why is there a spring in her step there should not be a spring in her step she should be terrified right now borrows Principles of Spell Design from the Ostenso academy library brings it back hands it to Keltham and quietly sits down again Shes at least managing not to smile she really would not blame security for killing her on the spot if she looked the slightest bit smug right now

Carissa walks in She looks well to untrained eyes perfectly normal perhaps like she spent slightly more time than usual on her hair to Chelish eyes like she went to Hell and back which does happen sometimes Dis occasionally extends an invitation to the living for its own reasons 

By the time shes walked into view of Keltham and sat down she has it under control mostly

 you want page ten says Meritxell who is going to be daunted by NONE of this 

Theyre all looking at Ione Why are they all looking at Ione Carissa prefers not to be looked at all things considered but she really expected to be looked at at this point She looks at Ione too in case whatever theyre all looking at is actually evident 

Theres a Forbiddance up says Peranza trying really hard to sound confused rather than angry

Ione smiles at Peranza

Oh god she shouldnt have done that Nethys is going to smite her now

Page ten and some more on page thirty eight I think says Meritxell somewhat loudly 

Thanks Ione Meritxell Keltham says and reads as directed He is a stern soul and can worry later about whether or not hes now living inside a Walker novel

Ione is not saying anything to anyone unless they ask her explicit questions and admit to everyone else how much less they know than Ione in which case Ione will still not tell them Or maybe shell tell them something true that makes them be even more confused or just lie Its hard to decide when you have so many tasty options

No one asks Ione any questions though Asmodia attempts to read her mind 

The book has an orderly list of heuristics for telling what the unobservable dimensions of magic are doing Most of their activities that you have to worry about for low circle spells are being attracted or repelled by other magic nearby them or having momentum of their own once tugged on indirectly by tugging on an observable dimension The strongly recommended way to handle this as a new wizard is to practice with small tweaks until you get a feel for it some people report success trying to imagine and explicitly track what the other dimensions are doing but most dont and it becomes practically impossible to do a fully encompassing version of as you approach higher circle spells There are a couple interactions to explicitly track starting at first circle they are such and such There are twice as many at second circle 

Ione Sala makes her Will save glances to see if Keltham is looking and then flashes a kindly smile at the girl with half her own combined caster circles Asmodia is lucky she failed so miserably her feeble mind would probably crumble if she succeeded in peeking into the thoughts of an oracle of Nethys

Shes going to get piled under later and its going to last for a while She may as well live it up briefly now

This plausibly is going to help Keltham feels more oriented by knowing whats going on in the background and what kind of surface effects to look for being caused by what even if he cant do math to it Maybe its a weird vestigial dath ilani security blanket thing but Keltham feels less like hes flailing around in empty air and more like hes flailing around in air that has visible objects in it

Im reaching the edge of how much stamina I allocated to spend on this I think next the plan says I try to cast Keltham has to think back on which spells he actually has Shit he didnt think to use Eagles Splendor while interacting with Lrilatha which was almost certainly what that spell was for oh well He can use the two spells one of which is Eagles Splendor not as important here and one of which is Owls Wisdom then have security cast Haste on him then cast Guidance and try to catch it then try to catch Read Magic he thinks that was the plan they came up with this morning Well I get some spells cast on me and then try to catch my remaining cantrips How long do Owls Wisdom and Haste last respectively

Owls wisdom is up to two minutes per caster circle the girls chorus distracted from their meaningful glaring at each other And Haste is up to two rounds per caster circle

Right so Owls Wisdom first then Can somebody call in whoevers doing Haste before I do And somebody please show me the gestures to catch Read Magic again

Yaisa goes to the door and opens it and returns with the nearest visible security wizard everyone else demonstrates how to catch Read Magic

Keltham somewhat hesitantly tries casting his first mind boosting magic that affects himself given to him by his unknown but hopefully friendly god The spell Carissa identified as Transmutation similar to the structure of what Carissa showed him for intelligence boosting The one that seems more like it should be Owls Wisdom going on either tiny intuition or sheer blind guessing passing itself as tiny intuition

It does something 

Thats Eagles Splendour Meritxell beats everyone else to saying It does charisma

This is truly odd Something that Keltham has been doing his whole life without really focusing on it that much became weirdly much easier Hes aware of his posture what his posture is saying how he could change it to project different emotions outward He knows what he could say to express these thoughts or even to lie but exactly because of that it feels much more like any words he said would be something like a lie a pose at least until he became used to this state and it became more natural He could fling his arms wide and announce how overjoyed he is and make it look real or speak with quietly subdued enthusiasm and make that look real but Keltham does not know under this spell how to do anything that is real

Eh might as well go all in while it lasts

This is really rather odd Keltham says with a more charming smile than any girl here or indeed anyone in greater existence has seen on his face before But distracting from magic I fear I hope I am not taking too much of securitys valuable time if I ask them to bide a short while before Hasting me until this wears off no more than eight minutes should it be and maybe less Interesting how dashing gentleman Baseline rhythms are coming out in Taldane he hopes its at all accurate and not just silly

Of course says the nearest visible security person smiling The spell provides no particular aid in interpreting his smile aside from making it apparent that smiles are a thing one can do in subtly different ways on purpose for subtly different results

I do not know if I will ever request this spell from my god again and foolish as I am I forgot to think of this contingency earlier but does anyone have any simple exercises for me to perform in the realm of acting and emoting Id gain skills and experience if I could before this spell fades

Pretend to be a duke receiving your idiot son who just got in trouble for rhinocerous racing in the streets says Tonia Meritxells the idiot son

Meritxell takes this in stride and bows Father

Duke sounds vaguely big and authoritative Company president Very Serious person

Keltham shifts his bearing older and more dignified and sorrowful with a hint of frustration Son Rhinocerous racing again Really

Its not like last time Father Last time I fully acknowledge I was irresponsible and caused a lot of property damage which was rightly taken out of my allowance This time we stayed off Queens Avenue entirely and only knocked over one carriage And furthermore it wasnt my idea Callisto challenged me and I did not think Id be doing right by you and the name youve honored me with if I refused and had him name me a coward

Kelthams total ignorance of vast amounts of context is almost completely unable to interfere with his acting momentum Son has it ever occurred to you that there is a certain irony or comedy even in letting yourself be put into self destroying situations for fear of being called a coward I name you meta coward now

Meritxell heroically manages to keep a straight face at that Father Should we embrace every injury to our name rather than falsify them

And what do tell is this injury to our name this proposition untrue which could not possibly hold in any world in which you raced rhinoceruses and so was decisively refuted by your acts

That I was afraid to race rhinocerouses

Son your logic while possessed of a certain local validity lacks an appreciation of greater contexts Are you afraid to take half your earnings and set them aflame

 well not if theyre in gold sir

Er right Gold melts if the flame is hot enough Anything melts if the flame is hot enough Do you see where Im leading with this my son

Youre going to light me on fire if I do this again

With Eagles Splendour running Keltham doesnt crack up at this I am saying son that like a sufficiently hot fire the notion of proving oneself unafraid to do things has a certain dangerous generality How about if in the future you prove yourself unafraid of refusing to do things to prove yourself unafraid of them

 yes Father Okay pretend to be a thief casing a magic shop to learn its protections before you rob it and Ione youre a shopkeeper who is trying to figure out whether hes going to make a purchase and whether youll offend anyone powerful kicking him out

This is of course a substantial social favor to Ione though theres no indication of that in Meritxells gesture she mightve chosen a classmate at random 

 Meritxell thinks Ione has got secret connections and or magical bloodlines going for her rather than HERESY and Ione is going to pay for this later but for this one golden moment shell take it for everything it has

Good evening sir Ione says graciously standing up from her chair Can I interest you in a slightly used mud golem She gestures at Asmodia It isnt pretty but that doesnt mean it lacks all possible use

Asmodia smiles pleasantly and only slightly murderously

Thief But a master criminal would be picking somebody else to impersonate somebody rich from context Charming rich person Oh interesting his thoughts are moving faster on this subject too

My you undersell your wares I think This is a fine mud golem Look at its smile What about this one here Keltham gestures towards Pilar and then as soon as Iones eyes shift in that direction Keltham takes several lightning glances around the room before moving his gaze back to Ione wow thats interesting he thinks his expression somehow did this thing where even if somebody was watching him that would have looked more natural and casual than it was

Oh that one is far more worthy of you sir the more he takes out on Pilar the less hell take out on Ione if Keltham happens to be a sadist An Alak Kuata original that one is from Osirion Have you ever had the pleasure of owning any golems of Sothiss making

Not yet I must say A recent shipment

Fresh as the sparkling morning dew sir If its not too forward of me can I ask what kind of golems you have in your current collection

Well that is a bit forward Im afraid Weve hardly even met and here youre asking me about my previous golem history Keltham slides an inch forward leans slightly and smiles flirtatiously at Ione It seems like a good idea to practice this particular skill at all before the spell wears off

Ione smiles back It does tend to help in providing a man with an additional golem perfectly to his taste she says solemnly

Everyone seems incredibly entertained Of course Carissa herself seems incredibly entertained while in reality this is occupying a tiny fraction of her attention and who is she to say really that that isnt true of everyone else Ione who presumably isnt stupid enough to have told everyone shes a oracle of Nethys is pretending what exactly Somethings up with an invisible assassin halfling who might or might not be watching this and that sure is some distracting information to have for that matter maybe every single person here except Keltham who couldnt hide it is having a day as interesting as Carissas The devil didnt promise the same offer wasnt being extended to everyone in the room Here shes been thinking she did something special but maybe this is actually just the default outcome in a situation of as much interest to the gods as this one

While Ione and Keltham are flirting she checks for illusions which would be suggestive of whether anyone has been arrested and is being impersonated already No one seems to be A promising sign if theyve all made it through the first day alive

Carissa hopes she is not called on for Improv With Innueno and relatedly is not at all in the mood to go on a date tonight An hour ago she was all delighted about it but now she does not want to beat Keltham at a challenge of sexual cleverness she wants what does she want to burn in the purified flames of Hell and emerge perfected Well Thats kind of kinky

Kelthams very weirdly augmented social presentation skills are telling him that hes screwing up faster than theyre telling him how to fix it the problem isnt in his bodys execution of the orders his mind is sending its that his mind is sending bad orders Ione may be acting interested for the sake of this skit but in real life well hes not sure because everybody here is sort of hard to read but in real life Ione probably wouldnt be interested in the Roguish Gentleman Template he picked up from some of his own previous larping Even if that Roguish Gentleman Template was being perfectly executed and even if it didnt come across as a weird dath ilani trope that may not even exist here Even if hes learning hes probably learning the wrong thing right now

Keltham is used to this feeling He knows that learning a new art often feels like screwing up or even meta screwing up the process of learning It doesnt occur to him to be embarrassed about that happening in public he clearly said that he was going into a learning and practice mode like how would people here even know how to read if theyd never learned and practiced anything in the presence of another human being

He tries another couple of flirting exchanges makes no headway on the problem of getting Ione to admit when shes getting off work and leaving her workshop open to robbery and then gives up

This scenario isnt working for me can we switch again Keltham says with more calm and confidence than that statement even warranted

Im trying to hire some adventurers to clean the rats out of my garden Asmodia says and youre all desperate to impress me with your qualifications

I fought a dragon once says Carissa instantly Well I was there while some people fought a dragon pseudoddragon but still Theyre really rats with wings they are and after that regular rats dont seem so frightening Unless theyve got the plague Which would still be fine I fought the plague once Well I was there while some people fought the plague 

I once slew three dozen rats in single combat when I was a gladiator slave in Katapesh says Tonia 

I once did that barehanded says Gregoria I used the corpse of the first rat to kill all the others

Reliable salesman go Ive solved over five thousand garden rat problems exactly like yours over just the past 10 days Keltham says

Gladiator slave in Kata something sounds unpleasant and like one of those things thats hard to translate into Baseline but you hear a lot of things like that when youre a dath ilani in Golarion Keltham decides not to put it on his priority list of things to ask about after an instant of internally sighing hesitation

Five thousand says Asmodia How do you find the time

Subcontractors Keltham says instantly

And you can cut out the middleman and just hire the subcontractors Im one of them says Pilar Hes the guy you need if you need to hire a lot of contractors but not if you need to kill a lot of rats

Someone with that big of a rat killing business has a lot of incentive to be going around releasing rats in everyones gardens How much do you trust him

I have solved a million rat problems just like yours in the last ten days Meritxell says I battled the rat god Lao Shu Po in Tian Xia and by injuring her grievously decreased global rat problems by 1 percent If I even walk near your garden the rats will run scared

Good comprehension of perverse incentives Carissa Keltham wasnt quite sure how much of that kind of knowledge would exist in a place like Cheliax

As a full service company we also offer post action reports on the root cause of your rat problems Keltham says smoothly sounding like a much more reliable and businesslike salesperson than all his wild eyed competitors If youre concerned about our ethics we can offer full service ethical investigations of rat related companies Buy all three of our services and get 20 off

For half his price Carissa says Ill fight your rats find whoevers spreading rats everywhere and feed them to the rats

What if its the rats that are spreading rats everywhere Asmodia asks skeptically

Well Ill feed the rats to the other rats in a rat pit of cannibalistic death and sell tickets and split the profits with you

My competitors talk a good game but have you considered that they might actually be rats wearing clever disguises

For a rat extermination job you want to hire a rat We know how rats think We know where rats live And we know what rats fear more than death

For a rat problem you want the best experts on rats Most rats are too close to rats to see rats clearly Our highly trained rat experts 

The Eagles Splendour wears off Keltham decides in a split second to try to continue and see how much of a difference it makes and whether anyone says theyve noticed

 live in distant isolated microcities where they do nothing except think about rats and experiment on rats every day When rats have a rat question they come to us

You must be very busy leading the world in rat extermination and rat research and ethics studies and rat infestation origin research Meritxell says Unless you know the origins of all the rat infestations before you start since youre releasing them something your position as the world leader in rat research would easily enable you to do You dont want a rat or a rat researcher You want someone whose footsteps make rats tremble And thats me

Fight against the rat god mustve gone pretty badly if youre now reduced to begging for garden assignments

I just hate rats so much I cant stop until theyre all dead

What say we all compromise Well all do the job together so she has no other options charge her twenty times the price and split the revenue fairly among ourselves

There are nods all around FINE Asmodia says flinging her hands in the air hopelessly and then there are cheers

Are you going to need that Haste says the security wizard tiredly 

Yeah let me swap to Owls Wisdom and then well run through it Eagles Splendour only wore off a quarter minute ago for what its worth I wanted to see if anyone noticed from outside

Do you only have Wisdom and Splendour and not Cunning Meritxell asks Id use Cunning to try to learn spells I guess Wisdom might be better for just trying to understand the basics of how magic moves

Oh right I was thinking it might be wiser to try only one mental augment at a time on my first day And no my god didnt give me Cunning I think Carissa thought it wasnt a cleric spell But if somebody else has it youre the experts tell me which one I should use

In general wizardry goes more off cunning Cunning is cleverness math working memory visualization Wisdom is perceptiveness wordless inference noticing if your thought patterns are avoiding something I have Cunning if you want

Key capability loading for catching a cantrip doesnt seem like cleverness and working memory though so much as perception and speed Not saying youre wrong just voicing my noticed confusion

Yeah theres honestly an argument that what youre specifically doing wants Dexterity rather than any of the mental enhancements and wisdom is probably fine even though in general wizards trying to grasp a new concept are limited on Cunning

I can give him dexterity too says the security wizard slightly impatiently

Keltham doesnt need arguments hes too ignorant for those he needs somebody more informed to give him the correct decision Snap poll dath ilani version Put your hand in front of your face then move it up if you think I should use Wisdom move it down if you think I should use Cunning how far you move your hand away from face level indicates the strength of your opinion If you think Im asking the wrong question close your hand into a fist to signal defiance of the question itself but answer anyways Again thats up for Wisdom down for Cunning fist to complain about the question Keltham demonstrates by moving his hand in both directions as he speaks and briefly closing it into a fist

The girls watch each other nervously and settle on a moderately strong recommendation for Wisdom which all hands then converge towards An optimist might conclude this was because theyre familiar with the theorems governing rational agents persisting in disagreements they have mutual knowledge of A Chelish person would likely interpret their uniform recommendation in the same spirit as their uniform smiles

 okay those people just looked at each other and adjusted their votes Later he will explain some important concepts about presenting unadjusted first impressions to avoid info cascades or better yet just closing your eyes until youve moved your hand into place that seems like it would be a simpler and more robust rule for non dath ilani But security guy seems impatient so for now hell quietly hope that that resolution procedure had any kind of shard of Law within it for aggregating their knowledge At least Carissa picked an opinion Wisdom and stuck with it and shes probably the most expert

Keltham casts Owls Wisdom on himself

And Keltham the object snaps into focus to Keltham the perceiver

His first thought is that Keepers would trade out of preference sexual favors or do crimes for this spell

His second thought is that theres so many thoughts he hasnt been thinking in the last day

His third thought is that this is a mind affecting drug one making him think that he can think better and promising epiphanies even if the rest of his mental processing isnt degraded There are protocols trained for being hit by mind affecting drugs like that which youre supposed to follow even if it seems like you have better ideas for things to do while youre on the mind affecting drug

It takes an additional effort and self surety for Keltham to override that very trained and solemnly advised protocol even temporarily But he can see even more clearly than he could at other times that it would be stupid to follow standard protocol and run out of this room immediately He knows hes more awake right now and it doesnt matter how many people think theyre becoming super awake as they fall asleep and into madness he can tell the difference

He still needs to cast his spells and then leave this room of untrusted others These are rules that derive strength from their unconditionality there is some real sense in which even an extremely well justified exception to them is breaking or bending a piece of the Algorithm that would work better for other people the more unconditional it is and those people should remember the same thing about that Algorithm Thats even leaving aside where part of his reason for violating these hard and fast rules about behaving under conditions of mental oddity is that he died in a plane crash and has been in a magical world for the last day which isnt the sort of epistemic state that hes wasting time

Its up Dexterity Haste

The wizard casts those Dexterity first and then Haste

Keltham casts Guidance on himself He tries to catch that cantrip too just in case he can

 yep Then its kind of sitting in his hand a little fragile 

Now you kind of tuck it away like youre spinning it so its all in some other dimension Carissa says quickly 

Aided by Owls Wisdom Keltham is already over the shock of getting that far and trying to finish what he saw others doing earlier with his Greater Detect Magic

The spell folds tidily away intact

Practice until the boosts run out so he can catch cantrips in the future or until he fails enough to be out of cantrips or he needs to take the last of the Owls Wisdom to truly think is the obvious course here so Keltham tries his Read Magic using the boost from Guidance 

And catches it His harem is cheering though mostly silently so as not to be distracting

Guidance again

He catches the spell the next four times and by then can feel that its starting to enter muscle memory no longer something that without a bunch of reflex enhancement hed be desperately struggling to do

Hell start trying to cast Detect Magic using the Guidance boosts Detect Magic and Guidance are the two cantrips hes plausibly going to need over and over and over

He manages it three times in a row before on the fourth the window slams security guy steps between it and Keltham casting something and Detect Magic slips away in Kelthams instant of distraction 

Keltham looks at the window to see if this is a room evacuating issue some of what his students said about Corn Failure Modes leaping awfully to mind Hell also try to hold his concentration on Detect Magic if possible

There are a bunch of overlapping spells on the window but nothing observably entering through it there is a dead bird on the ground outside the window 

Most likely security guy says without moving its just a regular dead bird that the Forbiddance picked off of which thereve been dozens in the last half hour We have a team checking it out though

Keltham goes back to practicing at once He will continue casting Guidance and using it to boost its own next cast until Haste runs out or catching fails then practice more Read Magic without Guidance until another minute of that passes or catching Read Magic fails

He doesnt fail at Guidance before Haste runs out He manages six of Read Magic without Guidance before losing it

This was a great success everyone and with any luck I can start looking more at how magic works tomorrow once I can watch magic happening Right now though I think I should quickly go off by myself and think for a few remaining minutes before the Owls Wisdom runs out and do that right away see you possibly at dinner 

Keltham is grabbing a couple of sheets of paper and a writing implement even as he speaks

No one interferes with him

Keltham moves out of the room even faster than he usually would thanks to Cats Grace also still in effect

See you later says Carissa who is officially the person with the rights to that line tonight as he reaches the door

Heh Indeed And then hes out of the library and speeds up again on the lookout for an apparently quiet and deserted unoccupied room on the way to his assigned bedroom hed rather not spend remaining spelltime to reach his assigned bedroom But hell go all the way to his bedroom if he doesnt see anywhere that looks appropriate for meditation

And also hes already started thinking

Standard procedure for dealing with a mind affecting drug that claims to produce useful insights is to write down the insights and see how much sense they still make after the drug wears off

While thats going on you dont let people who arent Keeper trained and Keeper oathbound talk to you You especially dont talk to people you dont trust an awful lot You double especially dont talk to whoever talked you into using the drug or maybe subtly guided you down a path that ended with that decision There are known drugs that seem to have an effect of permanently relaxing your priors about whatever somebody says to you while youre on drugs which in dath ilani terms is something like a date rape of the soul Keltham has had drugs that mimic the more innocuous effects that go along with those and Owls Wisdom is absolutely nothing like them but still

All of this is in any case advice youd only need in the first place if you went to a Shop of Ill Advised Consumer Goods Or if a criminal dosed you Dath ilan does not recognize any uses of lysergic acid diethylamide dimethyltryptamine or psilocybin within the mainstream of Well Advised Consumer Goods They dont do anything useful that cant be done by a high ranking Keeper just talking at you

The room right across from the library appears to be some kind of administrative staging area but the room after that some kind of antechamber is empty

Keltham ducks in and starts writing Translation spells are a thing and hes not sure how that interacts with cracking the kiddies substitution cipher he has memorized for writing non readable notes to himself in RPGs and so on Instead hes going to write down some cultural references from his homeworld and hope that theres no version of a cultural translation spell that reads through those Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra as it were

He doesnt have time to think through very much the first priority is just to write out all the things he hasnt been thinking notes to himself to hang the thoughts upon to be followed up later

Blue and orange is the first thing he scratches out Theres a constant drumbeat of hints that the people around him operate on a very alien and possibly inhumane morality and hes been saying things to himself like Carissa was probably making a joke he failed to get when she talked about tossing the rats into a pit to cannibalize each other and selling tickets to that like people would pay to see it Theres a whole history of little pings like that and his brain pushing back at the dissonance with Maybe it was a joke I didnt get and he can see that now while hes got Owls Wisdom running

Subverted True man Show he writes out next The girls all wore permanently cheerful expressions during class Meritxell and Ione and everyone else didnt read as any less genuine to him than their usual selves read while they were acting out routines like they were all experienced actresses like they were all already acting But theyre not running a well designed full Immersive Reality TV Show trope on him either If they were really such good actresses with smart people and smart scripts behind them they wouldnt be giving that away by wearing permanently cheerful smiles during class or by not acting awkward when they were called on to act out new weird scenarios Theyre not trying to prevent him from realizing that they all have and are using acting abilities like he got from his Charisma boost which if they were actually constructing a false reality around him would be the first thing theyd try to avoid him knowing

Keltham also makes a note in the back of his mind not for the first time today that if they dont get adequate Governance support and dont end up with more urgent priorities inventing ballpoint pens sure seems like it should be a moneymaker

The next part is hard for him to write It feels like its a betrayal of the person that hell be when this temporary boost wears off to think about this part to write down the anchor for it But he cant unsee it and its already too late

There is a commonly held wisdom in dath ilan about the way a human mind is put together that it is a thing made of little subtle tensions and balances and internal compromises The human mind being the limited thing that it is these balances form around your current level of ability to see into yourself and see the implications of what you already know or not see them as the case may be The reason why not everybody runs off to learn all they can from Keepers the reason why not everyone asks a Keeper to tell them all the answers about themselves is that this would bring parts of themselves into conflict that were previously living in a more agreeable truce of ignorance You might not survive as yourself if you could see yourself

Those who say That which can be destroyed by the truth should be may continue to walk the Path from there But not uncommonly even somebody who sets out along that Path turns back at some point and well short of becoming a Keeper Its not a trivial price higher for some than others and there is varying willingness to pay A lot of the reason why Keepers exist as what they are is that the people who have large comparative advantages there in how little theyll be hurt by knowing themselves or how much they really internally want to keep going anyways are conceived of by larger society as being paid to throw themselves on that grenade so others dont have to And if to some Keepers it doesnt feel like much of a grenade at all they understand that their case is not typical and are grateful for winning the comparative advantage lottery

Going up by two local standard deviations in whatever it is that Owls Wisdom enhances is something that the current structures of Kelthams personality were never built to withstand He knows from up here because he couldnt stop himself from glancing in that direction that in dath ilan he would never have had his 144 children He would have tried to be special and failed and been sad and then maybe gotten an ordinary 08sd job and either paid for a child out of that or decided he was too strange and unhappy to have one

Its not considered necessary for somebody Kelthams age to go and pay a Keeper to tell them exactly what the probabilities are about something like that Its not so much that people are encouraged to lie to themselves reality forbid but that people are told its okay for them not to shove themselves as hard as possible down the Pathway that will dissolve the mistakes their current personality is built out of Thats what Keepers are for They do it so that not everybody else has to There are grownups around in Civilization who can and will speak up if the people less mature are about to make some terrible mistake out of their blindness So you do not need to rush ahead to be a Keeper if youd rather be a little less coherent a little more yourself and your mistakes and your contradictions a little more human for a time

But its too late now for Keltham to go back because also in the common wisdom is that once you see what it is you werent letting yourself see once you know which mistakes your personality is founded upon or even if youre trying hard not to know it to the point where its becoming a big internal battle well at that point youre supposed to give it up It means that well sorry you are that smart now like it or not you are that wise you did grow up that much whether or not you wished to stay a child for longer its time to move on

And the part where he was going to fail at his lifes goals in dath ilan isnt even the important thing that he cant help but see now about himself realize now at this level of wisdom

There was a question asked once of some bright children among whom Keltham was numbered in a class where he had seemed to be among the oldest and worst performers a class assembled of kids who were faster than Keltham

And young Keltham had by that time already seen through some of the Lies Told To Children he was past his experience with finding that lightly injured adult on his way home He had learned that children are sometimes put into contrived situations meant to teach them things Keltham was suspicious already before the key moment he had already guessed that he was meant to learn in this class something about what it feels like to be surrounded by others faster and more knowledgeable and even younger than you are

But in this guess Keltham proved to be wrong he was not the one there who was to learn a lesson that day

The class was on self integrity and relatedly morals a class taught directly by a Watcher over Children not entrusted to older children at all

And the Watcher told the class a parable about an adult coming across a child whod somehow bypassed the various safeguards around a wilderness area and fallen into a muddy pond and seemed to be showing signs of drowning for theyd already been told then what drowning looked like The water in this parable didnt look like it would be over their own adult heads But in the parable theyd just bought some incredibly expensive clothing costing dozens of their own labor hours and less resilient than usual that would be ruined by the muddy water

And the Watcher asked the class if they thought it was right to save the child at the cost of ruining their clothing

Everyone in there moved their hand to the yes position of course Except Keltham who by this point had already decided quite clearly who he was and who simply closed his hand into a fist otherwise saying neither yes nor no to the question defying it entirely

The Watcher asked him to explain and Keltham said that it seemed to him that it was okay for an adult to take an extra quarter minute to strip off all their super expensive clothing and then jump in to save the child

The Watcher invited the other children to argue with Keltham about that which they did though Kelthams first defense that his utility function was what it was had not been a friendly one or inviting of further argument But they did eventually convince Keltham that especially if you werent sure you could call in other help or get attention or successfully drag the childs body towards help if that child actually did drown meaning the childs true life was at stake then it would make sense to jump in right away not take the extra risk of waiting another quarter minute to strip off your clothes and bill the childs parents insurance for the cost Or at least that was where Keltham shifted his position in the face of that argumentative pressure

Some kids at that point questioned the Watcher about this actually being a pretty good point and why wouldnt anyone just bill the childs parents insurance

To which the Watcher asked them to consider hypothetically the case where insurance refused to pay out in cases like that because it would be too easy for people to set up accidents letting them bill insurances not that this precaution had proven to be necessary in real life of course But the Watcher asked them to consider the Least Convenient Possible World where insurance companies and even parents did need to reason like that because thered proven to be too many master criminals setting up children at risk of true death from drowning accidents that they could apparently avert and claim bounties on

Well said Keltham in that case he was going right back to taking another fifteen seconds to strip off his super expensive clothes if the child didnt look like it was literally right about to drown And if society didnt like that it was societys job to solve that thing with the master criminals Though hed maybe modify that if they were in a possible true death situation because a true life is worth a huge number of labor hours and that part did feel like some bit of decision theory would say that everyone would be wealthier if everyone would sacrifice small amounts of wealth to save huge amounts of somebody elses wealth if that happened unpredictably to people and if society was also that incompetent at setting up proper reimbursements Though if it was like that in real life instead of the Least Convenient Possible World it would mean that Civilization was terrible at coordination and it was time to overthrow Governance and start over

This time the smarter kids did not succeed in pushing Keltham away from his position and after a few more minutes the Watcher called a halt to it and told the assembled children that they had been brought here today to learn an important lesson from Keltham about self integrity

Keltham is being coherent said the Watcher

Kelthams decision is a valid one given his own utility function said the Watcher you were wrong to try to talk him into thinking that he was making an objective error

Its easy for you to say youd save the child said the Watcher when youre not really there when you dont actually have to make the sacrifice of what you spent so many hours laboring to obtain and would you all please note how none of you even considered about whether or not to spend a quarter minute stripping off your clothes or whether to try to bill the childs parents insurance Because you were too busy showing off how Moral you were and how willing to make Sacrifices Maybe you would decide not to do it if the fifteen seconds were too costly and then any time you spent thinking about it would also have been costly and in that sense it might make more sense given your own utility functions unlike Kelthams to rush ahead without taking the time to think let alone the time to strip off your expensive fragile clothes But labor does have value along with a childs life and it is not incoherent or stupid for Keltham to weigh that too especially given his own utility function so said the Watcher

Keltham did have enough dignity by that point in his life not to rub it in or say told you so to the other children as this would have distracted them from the process of updating

The Watcher spoke on then about how most people have selfish and unselfish parts not selfish and unselfish components in their utility function but parts of themselves in some less Law aspiring way than that Something with a utility function if it values an apple 1 more than an orange if offered a million apple or orange choices will choose a million apples and zero oranges The division within most people into selfish and unselfish components is not like that you cannot feed it all with unselfish choices whatever the ratio Not unless you are a Keeper maybe who has made yourself sharper and more coherent or maybe not even then who knows For it was said in another place it is hazardous to non Keepers to know too much about exactly how Keepers think

It is dangerous to believe said the Watcher that you get extra virtue points the more that you let your altruistic part hammer down the selfish part If you were older said the Watcher if you were more able to dissect thoughts into their parts and catalogue their effects you would have noticed at once how this whole parable of the drowning child was set to crush down the selfish part of you to make it look like you would be invalid and shameful and harmful to others if the selfish part of you won because youre meant to think people dont need expensive clothing although somebody whos spent a lot on expensive clothing clearly has some use for it or some part of themselves that desires it quite strongly

It is a parable calculated to set at odds two pieces of yourself said the Watcher and your flaw is not that you made the wrong choice between the two pieces it was that you hammered one of those pieces down Even though with a bit more thought you could have at least seen the options for being that piece of yourself too and not too expensively

And much more importantly said the Watcher you failed to understand and notice a kind of outside assault on your internal integrity you did not notice how this parable was setting up two pieces of yourself at odds so that you could not be both at once and arranging for one of them to hammer down the other in a way that would leave it feeling small and injured and unable to speak in its own defense

If Id actually wanted you to twist yourselves up and burn yourselves out around this said the Watcher I could have designed an adversarial lecture that would have driven everybody in this room halfway crazy except for Keltham Hes not just immune because hes an agent with a slightly different utility function hes immune because he instinctively doesnt switch off a kind of self integrity that everyone else in this class needs to learn to not switch off so easily

It was a proud day for Keltham and a formative one that dath ilan had acknowledged that the alien in their midst might have his uses Like making it slightly easier to demonstrate a useful childrens lesson for a class full of the smarter and more altruistic kids who would actually grow up to matter But even so theres a difference between growing up in a world that has no place for you and no use for you and respects nothing about you versus a world which has a place for you and some use for you and ever really actually admits you can get some things right a little faster

Keltham doesnt review all that in his mind There isnt enough time left on the Owls Wisdom for that

The other thing he sees from up here is the point that his mind was put together the way it is including the part where hes a kid who doesnt have to rush down the Path to stare at things like the truth that he couldnt have made a difference in dath ilan and including the part where his contribution to diversity is pursuing the Way of being selfish and the things that selfish people can see faster than others his whole self was put together based on the assumption that hes in dath ilan where if Keltham is like that terrible things wont happen to him

Or to other people

Golarion isnt dath ilan

His entire self and personality and emotional balance was assembled around beliefs that might not still be true Probably arent true

Keltham doesnt try to make any big decisions right now he shouldnt thats not what you do when youre on a new mind affecting drug that is promising all kinds of startling revelations about yourself and what a foolish wrong person youve been But its something that he needs to think about after the spell wears off

Drowning child Keltham writes on the paper Sorry

The spell doesnt wear off immediately after he writes it because reality isnt dramatic like that

He spends the remaining time looking around himself for other hidden thoughts instead because that is the sensible thing to do and when your Wisdom goes up by two local standard deviations doing the sensible thing has a greater intuitive force because you can actually see how it is sensible and why

And then the spell wears off

He spends a while just breathing evenly trying to absorb the full force of the blow hes taken which is also a recommended procedure

Flowers for mouse he thinks and doesnt bother to write it on the paper because its not a message from the Wiser Keltham and he doesnt even really feel that way its just his brain completing a cliche

They also say youre not supposed to throw away and revise your entire personality at once and he is still himself he is still Keltham he is not an average dath ilani carrying out a LARP assignment of being more selfish than average he is actually the person who didnt need to be taught self integrity and who wanted to be paid for helping somebody else If he decides to change things it will have to be built around who Keltham is a person who is not an average dath ilani And an average dath ilani would have to make changes too if they were here Only a Keeper is supposed to be built out of pure sharp coherent abstractions that could walk from one world to another and not need to change their clothes along the way

The part of himself thats terrified hes going to suddenly admit that everything he holds dear was a factual mistake and turn himself into an average dath ilani in dath ilan is probably right to be terrified in some ways because in many particular dimensions thats a kind of decision that his Wiser self left open as a possibility and he cant unsee or unremember things he should have been too young and stupid to see But he is not supposed to turn into an average dath ilani in dath ilan He needs to be Keltham in Golarion

Why didnt they warn him

Because people in Golarion get Owls Wisdom cast on them once every six months and theyve never experienced what its like to have gone your whole life without Owls Wisdom

Somehow Keltham doesnt think thats it

Its a piece of something wrong something he doesnt know something he believes thats false about this entire situation this entire world People not quite behaving like obvious models say they should

 or they just have so little internal stuff that is actually powered by self reflection that not very much happens to them when they suddenly get amplified reflection

No that also feels like one of those weird excuses that Keltham was coming up with inside to dismiss puzzle pieces

Keltham does feel annoyed on some level injured even that there werent more warning signs He thought he was getting a perception boost or maybe the equivalent of 01sd at some innate mental quality not this Or well no he didnt have that much of a model he didnt really think about it at all he didnt ask because he was still mentally living in a world where everything that can hit you really hard has a clearly attached warning sign that Civilization put there

But its also not the sort of thing that you should just allow to happen if you are running a massive complicated scam on the alien visitor Unless you figure that you cant really stop him from casting Owls Wisdom on himself so you might as well just let it happen They couldve told him it would only last ten seconds and then sneakily hit him with a Dispel Magic he knows thats a standard magic it was in the books

Keltham can feel that hes thinking little dissonant pieces of thoughts grinding against themselves and he knows that if he had Owls Wisdom back he would be able to see how and why they were grinding against themselves and sort them out much more easily

Maybe if he casts this spell on himself once per day and practices thinking the way he practiced cantrips hell be able to well turn into a more Keeperlike version of himself

If he wants that

Well no hes pretty sure he doesnt want that

If he chooses it anyways

There is something dangerous Keltham thinks about having a sense of perspective if too much of it comes on too quickly there is seeing yourself and the shadow of everything youve done from the perspective where it is smaller and stupider even the parts of you that provided all of your drive and your will and your sense of enjoyment in life maybe not as ill things in themselves but arranged stupidly and with no better way to arrange them being obvious as yet because you were only wiser for something less than eight minutes Of which you spent half that time practicing spellcasting

He is not looking forwards as much to his date with Carissa tonight as he was an hour ago Because hes looked back and reflected on himself and on the whole headlong rush forwards that is a defining quality of Mad Investor Chaos And now he is in fact thinking questioning thoughts about whether it is really in his own long term self interest or yes the interest of a bunch of drowning children that he does care about literally at all even if he wants to be paid for saving them for him to prioritize having sex with his research harem as one of his top goals on his second day in another universe

Should he actually be hesitant about that It doesnt make sense does it He should not in the face of this shock have suddenly turned into a standard dath ilani He is still himself he should still have the parts of himself that are hyped for a date with Carissa Being hit with a temporary spell should not have changed those internal parts And if now his self is in a weird internal state of strife that prevents him from ever having any fun again then he is pretty sure a Keeper would tell him that this is not the optimal way to get smashed and rearranged by a temporary reflectivity increasing mind affecting drug

Theres a lot to be said for trying to snap out of this and go back to his normal and then only change one piece of himself at a time from there in response to new facts about Golarion as he actually learns them because Keltham has not precached any other sensibly configured ways to be

That sounds to Keltham like the sort of standard advice that a Keeper would give you about what to do if youve had an overly large epiphany especially one induced by a temporary state of perception you cant go back and access again

Keltham continues to sit and think for a time

The girls glare expectantly at Ione the instant Keltham leaves the room

Ione is now trying to think very fast

So They obviously havent been told Which earlier Ione thought in the back of her mind would happen as soon as the security wizard walked out after gouging her eye because theyd tell her former classmates about the new security risk because all of Cheliax would unite against her in hating her and hurting her as much as they could short of killing her Apparently the part where by default security doesnt tell anyone anything takes higher precedence

Also she is now visibly useful to the project and that casts a different shade on the whole thing where she knows how she wishes this would go but to make security go along with it she needs to have something to offer security something to bargain with security something that Nethys wouldnt require her to just hand over anyways 

She also has to choose how to answer the expectant looks now even if its silence she has to make it clearly deliberate 

Ione thinks of something she can offer security and picks her strategy to try with the other girls because she doesnt want to spend the rest of her life with Kelthams other women being as cruel to her as wont kill her whenever Keltham isnt looking

So Im not really sure Ione says using the glorious feeling of realizing her curses real power to fuel a smile but I think Asmodeus cut a deal with Nethys to go in on Kelthams project together and I was the person here who was best suited to get the power from Nethys to summon temporary copies of books from other libraries plus whatever else it is I can do now Didnt do it on purpose just happened to me

There is an astonished silence But shes not dead which says that theyre not supposed to kill her which is something 

Security says Paxti after a few seconds Im obliged to report evidence of forbidden primary worship even if I think you have it already

This makes everyone else tense nervously because they didnt say that but now obviously its too late 

Security is most visibly at the window making sure the dead bird is just a dead bird 

You should walk to the Forbiddance boundary and back Meritxell says To prove youre still loyal to Hell The Forbiddance wont hurt you if you are

Or they could just tell me to fail a Will save and read my mind Also Forbiddance goes by alignment not loyalty to Asmodeus and I wouldnt be here if they werent sure about Lawful Evil

But sure if an expert says that getting touched by Nethys didnt change my alignment for Forbiddance purposes Ill walk out and walk back if the actual security here tells me I should

Ione thinks loudly about her offer to security if they dont shoot her down on this Kelthams going to want a book on cleric spells at some point shes guessing and if they make up their own version of a book or remove a few pages and hide it in this library Ione can summon a copy of that to give to Keltham Nethys she thinks wouldnt want her to withhold help from Kelthams project so she knows she doesnt have her help to bargain with she knows she has to give it anyways But the version of this where shes actively cooperating with security giving them helpful suggestions like that and going along with Cheliaxs masquerades if shes doing all that she wants to be treated more like Nethyss oracle that got sent here by pact with Asmodeus to help with Cheliaxs project which is probably what she really is and not be treated like a heretic and traitor she never asked to become or wanted to be

Elias Abarco pulls off his invisibility looking greatly annoyed Hes mostly annoyed because Ione doesnt seem to care about anybody they spent the last couple hours checking up on familial and nonfamilial relations they could murder or nearly murder to make a point and her parents sold her to the school and she has an older brother who by all accounts hates her and she hates him back This is healthy and encouraged in young wizards but its damn inconvenient when one is irritated with Ione Sala and really wants to rip something she cares about to pieces before her eyes 

He nods to Paxti because she was right and should know it

Shes still Lawful Evil he says curtly Paxti you should hit the rest of them for being slow in reporting Do you know the spell 

Yes

And he looks at Ione Raises his eyebrows slightly nods even more slightly than that And heads off to see why the damned bird is taking them so long because it turns out that supervising a bunch of god touched teenagers is the worst

Ione does not think thank you obviously there are so few occasions in Cheliax where its ever appropriate to say that shes surprised sometimes the word hasnt died out Deal is what she thinks back along with her very Lawful and Asmodean intention to keep her deals fully if the other party keeps theirs

Paxti is not actually delighted by this assignment at all not that this shows on her face theyre very much playing an iterated game here and that means that hitting people too hard is risky and hitting people too lightly is risky and while no ones outright glaring at her several of them look a bit contemptuous even though she got this right and they got this wrong The contemptuousness is a sign she should err on the side of too hard 

Carissa would kind of like for less of her mental energy to be caught up in imagining there is an invisible halfling from Otolmens here ready to kill someone Its really cramping her style But there is a halfling or at least there might be unless Asmodeus told Aspexia Rugatonn to do something different which is not less terrifying and so she doesnt want to particularly confront Ione even though she has some good material for it or even ask Ione for a book which is what shed do if there were slightly less at stake here because it seems likely that Nethyss intervention here is part of what Otolmens is objecting to 

Paxtis spell slaps her harder than people usually bother with Carissa wishes there were a way for Paxti to know that shes not just affecting being so absorbed in more important matters that she barely noticed she actually is so absorbed in more important matters than she barely noticed but theres not

I never worshipped Nethys Ione says while this is going on I never deliberately read anything about any gods that werent Asmodeus I passed my loyalty checks You report it because its evidence but while youre doing that have your own sense about what must have actually happened Nethys has an obvious interest in working with Asmodeus on this and I doubt there are any actual Nethys worshippers on site or whod be allowed in I was just the one there who liked books

Then Ione realizes she has to say and it also works for her own benefit that she says it Note though Keltham thinks Im a secret Nethys worshipper and Ive told him that probably most of you and most Chelish government officials wouldnt care but that I wasnt sure Security thinks that once Keltham learns the spells to verify that Im Nethys touched I can be a secret worshipper of Nethys here who confirms our stories to him So dont treat me as anything except somebody with a weird book fetching power anywhere Keltham might see that You are not supposed to know anything about me other than that and even if you did Keltham doesnt think that worshipping Nethys is something thatd get most people after me

Its a security advisory its clearly a correct security advisory and if Ione gives it before anybody else does it means Ione is somebody who sometimes says what the security advisories are Which obviously she absolutely will never abuse for anything Chelish security would not in fact like she is a very good and cooperative oracle of Nethys she is only securing her own safety among the lesser mortals who arent security

The lesser mortals who arent security take the meaning and look variously impressed or annoyed or unreadable 

Can you get destroyed books says Meritxell after a moment Can you get books out of Abadars vault

No it seems pretty power balanced so far Ione says hardly even thinking about the learned reflex that halts her instinct to start spilling the exact details of what she can do At least at the current circle equivalent of whatever it is

Huh Well if you go mad Ill try to put you down while theres still something for Hell to salvage And she heads off to dinner 

Carissa wonders absently what Meritxell would do if instructed by Asmodeus Himself to learn to be more Evil 

Ione will go back to her usual quiet self unless people ask her more questions or actively talk to her while she goes on trying to rethink her life She clearly cant continue playing her game of being the quiet one and never attracting attention but that was just a game so it shouldnt be too hard for her to figure out a different one She could have levered her higher grades into a position of more dominance in the classroom she could have played riskier games and ended up closer to the top she just deliberately decided it wasnt worth the risk before and now she doesnt have that option anymore

Being the quiet one was just a game move right

Elias shoos the other kids out to dinner after a few more minutes of them playing stupid teenager social games so he can have another word with Ione 

You should strip he says once theyve left I am considering lighting you on fire and itd be inconvenient to replace your clothes

Ione Sala takes off her clothes immediately without protest old reflexes of fear overwhelming her and making it hard to think much further She manages not to tremble too much about it

I am noticing a pattern Elias says The pattern is you decide that actually fucking submitting to the will of Asmodeus and promptly doing whatever He wants would be inconvenient for you personally maybe get you killed so instead you try to sell your obedience to which we are already entitled in bits and chunks for things you want Do you see how I might have observed this pattern

Nethys has a grip on my soul now I can feel it and it doesnt matter whether or not I object to Asmodeus making that deal but you wouldnt let Nethys keep up His end of whatever this is unless I made it hard for you to sweep me out of the way which I know I have to do because otherwise Nethys will break me and I wouldnt be surprised if Asmodeus predicted that when He gave me to Nethys because He also knew that security would try to 

Elias does light her on fire at that point just because the sentence runs on so long He doesnt maintain the spell for longer than its natural one round though he regrettably actually should not kill her 

Im not a theologian he says but Im slightly less stupid than you and my read is Asmodeus gave you to Nethys because Kelthams going to demand corroboration from other churches which you can provide And had security reached that conclusion when you turned yourself in promptly like you should have then we wouldnt have killed you or would have raised you if we didnt think of it in time If it serves Asmodeus for you to live then you dont have to fight like a rabid seagull to give us reason to keep you breathing because the incentives were already there If it serves Asmodeus for you to die then none of these games will work And if youre unpredictable enough then at some point it will serve us for you to die simply because corpses dont make sudden moves that wreck half a dozen plans they dont know about Stop it No more games no more deals

This is about as painful as the most painful punishment shes been through

Dont care if I die she coughs out when she can speak She doesnt try to stop the trembles the sobs that interrupt her but she knows that this is probably the most important negotiation of her life so she should spend everything she has on continuing it Belong to Nethys have to work for Him I served Asmodeus from fear because He would get my soul and you know thats good enough for Lord Asmodeus but its not true anymore dont tell me what Asmodeus wants thats your side mine is what Nethys wants so I want to make a deal Asmodean and then Ill be predictable

Sure Heres your deal Stop fucking with me You live you stay in your library you get the books we tell you to get you study magic very diligently and impress Nethys he likes high circle casters and you never again screw us over for the sake of your bargaining position or Ill see to it you never hit third circle and I dont think Nethys cares at all about people who have barely started studying magic Lots of people dont hit third Keltham wont be suspicious If you dont give me an easier way to do it I will do it by making you stupider and I know how Nethys would feel about you then Got it

Theres a flare of hate in her then now that she wont go to Hell for hating Asmodeuss servants And with that hate flashes of contempt starting to arrange themselves around her sudden new identity She is too scared too shaking from being on fire for a minute and too angry not to think the thoughts that she is thinking now

You can make Asmodeans into high level wizards if you give them enough intelligence boosts but you cant make them think Shes not particularly happy about having thought that she doesnt actually want to insult the person in front of her if hes reading her mind but the thought came to her anyways

The security wizard hasnt realized that this entire conversation has been predicted out by Nethys and Asmodeus he isnt curious about the divine he isnt keeping his eyes open and because of that he doesnt see Hes posturing about serving Asmodeus and not realizing how this whole interaction theyre having right now is something that Asmodeus no doubt had to work around and pay Nethys extra for in order to get a library oracle on His project She hopes somebody in Hell has a very very long talk with him about that after he dies

Nethys has really gone to some lengths in ways very visible to her to make sure that Nethys can seriously threaten her and Chelish security cant

She cant be maledicted she cant be tortured for very long if shes killed in the course of sincerely doing her duties that thought doesnt actually bother her at all if she gets to go to Nethyss afterlife and study magic forever instead of burning and maybe Cheliax wouldnt dare kill her anyways because if she cant be maledicted somebody else might raise her and shed talk all about Keltham Ione Sala doesnt know what Nethys has set up against somebody cursing her stupider but maybe itll be too obvious to Keltham by then or she can pray to Nethys for divine aid or she could simply go to Keltham and tell him its time to find a university who can Heal her better Or maybe the higher ups here are aware that cursing Nethyss oracle with stupidity would in fact constitute a serious slap in the face of a god one whos very hard to keep out of things on a site already subjected to extensive divine intervention

And she is too scared too shaking and too angry not to think what she thinks then

Thats not how compacts work Asmodean Theyre negotiated not dictated Nethys made very sure you wouldnt be able to escalate your threats against me to worse than what Nethys could do Maybe you should call in a more experienced security officer who knows how to negotiate with non Asmodeans you cant just maledict Someone who understands what happens if you leave people scared of being set on fire and stupidified and your negotiating position does not in fact let you just keep escalating further until you send them to Hell Non Asmodeans stay on the lookout for ways to improve their bargaining positions if theyre scared and you havent made a real deal with them thats what happens I wasnt ambitious and Im still not ambitious and I dont want really very much at all if you negotiated terms with me Id be very predictable and wouldnt even ask for very much but if Asmodeuss representative wants Nethyss representative to be predictable he needs to bargain for that and not just dictate

I understand Ione whispers out loud meekly Hes either reading her thoughts like a halfway intelligent person or hes not shell see

You got your deal And I dont notice you being reasonable and predictable at all

I didnt understand that She genuinely didnt Is he saying he read her thoughts or does he think theyve already done a deal or she doesnt get it

Sure hell speak more slowly When Nethys chose you you could have come to us You went to Keltham instead to try to position yourself better for a deal We granted you that you would continue attending class with your little friends When you realized you had book summoning powers you could have come to us You showed them to Keltham instead to try to make it more inconvenient to replace you Then you proposed your deal that we dont set the other students against you that despite all your behavior in the past two days we treat you like an Asmodean student and encourage them in the same I agreed to that too And then I told you dont do that again You want to stay here falsely admired by your peers trusted by Keltham Great That has been agreed to You have that But if you push us any farther we will take you out of the picture The deal is that there will not be further deals

I dont know why you think Asmodeus bargained for Nethyss intervention here The Grand High Priestess said nothing of that when she came to read your mind and she pays a great deal of attention to the question of how we accidentally make ourselves more costly for Asmodeus to steer I think Nethys paid Asmodeus for whatever Hes doing and if it costs Nethys more that serves my god thats what I think If you are a small obedient little girl who only wants a few small things then having attained those small things I dont see why youd hesitate to agree that youll stop withholding things from us stop presenting them to Keltham first to try to force a concession from us afterwards and stop trying to condition your obedience on our further concessions The game you have played twice today you will not be able to play a third time have I said it enough ways you comprehend it now

The Grand High Priestess was 

dont think things that make your bargaining position look worse think things that make your bargaining position look better

The Grand High Priestess was here and didnt do anything to her That says a lot really Nethys probably prepared in ways she cant even see

Ione draws a shaky breath and sits up straighter Are we negotiating a deal Or is Asmodeuss representative telling Nethyss representative how its going to be

Lets hear what the small obedient girl who only wants a few small things still wants

Ione crawls over to where she left her clothes and puts them back on which is helpful for her to get some of her sudden seething hatred under control Whatever else comes shes never passing a Chelish loyalty screen again and she may as well think what she fucking wants now which really leaves quite a lot of thoughts backed up and this is not the time for them

Oracle of Nethys Ione Sala of the librarys curse she says when her clothes are back on and shes sitting on the ground My god has either joined with your god or been paid by Him to assist on a project to bring another planes knowledge to Cheliax I require a bed either in the library or in a room immediately adjacent to it Aside from this I am content with ordinary student level sustenance and living conditions which you will not worsen or withhold You may either leave the other students here ignorant about my true nature or tell them but then instruct them further not to mistreat me in any way whatsoever whether or not Keltham is watching I understand there may be some restrictions on me These restrictions need to mostly not prevent me from providing the services that Nethys intended me to offer this project Whatever pay or equity is negotiated by Keltham for the participants in his project will be allowed to actually accrue to me if it actually accrues to any single one of the other girls and Cheliax cant take it from me including by unexpected fees or cost increases You dont do anything clever to work around all that and make my life worse

In exchange I will cooperate with Chelish security on the understanding that they treat me as a friendly representative of the allied god Nethys and not an Asmodean traitor who gets set on fire at somebodys whim If we have disagreements we work them out by negotiating as equals not by a wizard who works for Cheliax showing up and gouging out my eye If at some point you come up with something extra that you want from me dont threaten me into it offer me an interesting book Or a magic item Or if you want me to do almost anything you can offer me my brother as my slave Apart from that I dont think I have any long term goals besides pleasing Nethys enough to get a good Nethysian afterlife Im not impatient to reach ninth circle here instead of there

If you manage to come up with a brilliant way to screw me on this deal its off because Im not an Asmodean and youre not a devil and this isnt a contract between two Asmodeans its a Nethysian Asmodean deal Im Lawful and Ill keep my deals that are actually sensible deals for sensible people being sensible about them Im not an Asmodean any more and I wont keep a contract that an Asmodean twisted around

What makes Ione Sala predictable is when she thinks she can be safe if she stays predictable which mostly means that she needs to be safe from Nethyss displeasure The main thing that causes me to start looking for ways to improve my bargaining position with Cheliax is if it looks to me like Cheliax might suddenly decide to do anything it wants to me at any time especially things that might hinder my service to my god unless my bargaining position is better I will remember your claim that security would have worked with me if Id come directly to them and if you keep your side of things I will try coming straight to you at least the next time I think I see something Nethys would want me to do I hear your claim that my doing anything else unpredictable makes me too much of a liability and I will be killed no matter what after that which I understand would make it hard to continue doing what Nethys wants me to do and I understand Nethys would see that as a betrayal if I let it happen on purpose

Our gods have an obvious common interest We dont have to fight I respect what Asmodeus has to offer this project I hope Cheliax respects what Nethys has to offer

Ione finishes talking Shes trying to tense her entire body so it will stop fucking trembling and she knows she cant do this for much longer

Oh do you want your brother after all says Elias with some satisfaction I spent a while trying to see if there was anyone in the world you liked All right Next time you have a bright idea come to us next time we have a demand Ill bribe you

Ione found a wounded bird when she was very young She hid it from her parents and tried to nurse it back to health She hadnt even had it a full day before her brother found it and killed it in front of her slowly by tearing off bits of it at a time Its the last instance Ione can recall of still having a heart to break because afterwards it was very clear to her that anything she ever cared for would just become a weapon that somebody else could use to hurt her

Is it too late to pretend that I love my brother dearly Ione says not quite believing that shes joking with him And deal

He pulls together an arcane healing spell Fixes the burns when he shakes her hand If you loved that asshole I really would have to conclude Nethys had driven you mad Stay out of trouble

Yes sir Ione says without thinking at all and then sighs at herself but only internally

Halfling slave 958245 Broom has just seen a trembling human girl strip naked and then be set screaming on fire which challenged his understanding of reality not in the slightest After that other things were said which challenged his understanding of reality significantly more Did the girl just win That is frankly not where he was expecting this to go

He wouldnt set somebody on fire if they were implicated in the possible end of the world They might explode Broom thought about trying to do something but before he was done hesitating the girl wasnt on fire any more and then she was still talking disrespectfully to the powerful wizard who had just set her on fire

That does seem like the sort of person who might destroy the world either by accident or on purpose

The conversation afterwards didnt make it seem like Ione Sala was planning to do that right away but Broom is still feeling somewhat worried He can imagine somebody carrying the sort of grudge from being set on fire where they decide to destroy the world about it Especially if its been happening to them regularly He doesnt like being whipped and healed and whipped again He hated that one time of his life where it was happening to him a lot He just didnt have any options for doing anything about that such as for example destroying the world

It is not entirely clear to Broom that Chelish security quite understands how to avoid making giant messes or how to clean them up which he supposes makes sense of why some god named Otolmens would randomly grab Broom in the hallway and tell him to do it

 and yet despite that Broom finds himself smiling

Well he thinks he knows why hes doing that

She did win after all

Broom wipes the smile from his face once he realizes why its there He watches Ione pull a book out of air visibly trembling and sit down to read the book while she continues trembling looking very much like shes trying to avoid having a breakdown in front of any invisible watchers He keeps watching until hes pretty sure shes not about to grab her wizard stuff and start destroying the world and then leaves the library to check on his other person of interest

Carissa ducks out from the crowd headed to dinner and goes to her room

Shes pretty sure she can fake her way through a date with Keltham but she doesnt want to She can come up with several justifications and shes not sure she buys any of them but one is that when they tell him more which theyre going to have to eventually shed like to tell him that she wasnt lying about this Another one is that she is trying to become bigger more capable more Evil in the sense of wanting Evil things for her own reasons rather than the sense of being willing to do what it takes to survive and so it seems like practice in the wrong direction to go on a date while not wanting to Another one is that at lunchtime she was so happy full of ideas and satisfaction and cleverness and the conviction that there was something big and beautiful and perfect out there and Keltham was leading her towards it and she wants that back

She doesnt objectively speaking have any reason to have lost it She has basically earned confirmation that she was right that there is something big and beautiful and perfect out there and that Keltham is leading her towards it her and not anybody else or at least her first She didnt have the details nailed down but if youd asked her to bet at lunchtime she wouldnt have bet she had the details right already The main reason she now feels sick and small and scared isnt that she was wrong at lunchtime its that she realized since then that the path to big and beautiful and perfect requires skills she doesnt have and doesnt have long to acquire 

 not a useful line of thought 

 why does she want to go on a date with Keltham Other than because theres a competition with that as a win condition and shes very competitive Other than because if they have children theyll be very smart and Cheliax will objectively owe her lots of money for them whether or not it pays up Other than because hes attractive when hes trying to be that instead of trying to be a hundred other things

Well because theres something he is getting right There is something no one in Cheliax is getting right except maybe Aspexia Rugatonn and Aspexia Rugatonn cant teach it even if she knows it because if she could then everything would be different Theres a kind of way of living in the world that Keltham has and they dont and he saw immediately what a tragedy that was and wanted to teach it to literally everyone because not because hes Good hes not hes a lot more Good than people here because his surroundings were but she can actually tell the difference and hes not 

But you dont have to be Good to see a mess a Lawless mess if youd like and to wish that the beings in it stood taller smarter clarified and free not as good as when they had no free will maybe but at least out of the local equilibrium where they have it but are not competent to use it 

Hes also a teenager in way over his head and missing half the information he needs and depending which skills he grows in which order hes very possibly going to demand when Cheliax comes clean with him that everyone involved in the decision to deceive him be tortured to death which would be reasonable but 

 she wants to sleep with Keltham because she wants everything he has and she wants to see more pieces of him and she wants it very very badly And she sits with that and lets it fill her up the longing to see the end of the path the longing to tell him things and watch him think about them to check the little Keltham she is building in her head against the real thing and see if she gets it yet 

There Thats better She goes to dinner 

Keltham heads to dinner still feeling shaky It does not occur to him to hide this he is distracted and by default he is not an actor posing

He grabs his food and sits down next to Carissa who seems to have gotten there before him not sure what he wants to say to her Cancel the date Theres a presumption there about Carissa wanting to date him only under narrow conditions that have not actually been specified

Hey says Keltham

Hey Noticing that something is troubling Keltham is well within Carissas baseline perceptiveness about things that might determine whether she lives or dies even when she is extremely distracted you okay

Nope Keltham says because in dath ilan there are no pleasantries that you are meant to respond to with lies and if there were the people there would revolt against their language and start over What does your own model of reality say that Owls Wisdom is predicted to do to somebody

 some adventurers use it pretty much daily so it cant have like particularly noticeable long term effects from regular use Clerics tend to get its equivalent in a headband like wizards get headbands for cunning and it makes them better servants of their god I have heard of people saying it gave them a profound religious experience From the look on Kelthams face thats not quite it but closer It sort of is a religious experience in a way touching the state of being a little more like a god 

Yes Being a little more like a god You know somebody asked in class what makes someone have the potential to become a Keeper Its that Its the thing Owls Wisdom boosts Taldane doesnt actually have a word that means cognitive reflectivity If you dont have people screaming about that and giant warning labels on the spell then maybe my first angry thought afterwards was right and yes in fact almost nobody here has much inside them that actually draws on the thing that Owls Wisdom boosts so nothing much happens to yall when you use it

 oh Gods Im sorry No Ive never heard of anything thatd make people warn there are people with 22 Wisdom and theyre not even close to Keepers they dont have the rest but I guess if you stuck a headband on you would be

Its not your fault But I realized how I was put together in a way that probably no lets be frank in a way that cant possibly make sense and then it wore off and now Im not smart enough to fix what I remember seeing and Im not even sure thats what I want to do

Ha My brains totally thinking that this may not be a bad thing in the long run and it sure wouldnt have been thinking that an hour ago

She thinks she understands though and it sounds like a very bad thing if you dont have time to put yourself back together afterwards Not a bad thing she murmurs rather than think of something she can actually say

That which can be destroyed by the truth should be Its a proverb thats remembered as much for how its false as for how its true because among the things that truths can destroy is people Theres a whole philosophy around that saying One of the key points is that maybe sometimes it makes sense to not push a truth on others if you think itll hurt them it can make sense to not walk up to Keepers and ask them to tell you everything youre not seeing But if you saw it yourself its too late you cant unsee it and theres no way out but forwards

So plus side the way I was put together was not too bad for dath ilan and almost certainly all wrong for Golarion and being stuck like that while refusing to look at exactly what I was doing wrong probably wouldnt have turned out great for me On the minus side before the Owls Wisdom wore off my brain went and fully admitted to itself that I had no hope of ever succeeding in my life goals back in dath ilan and I did not really need that much personality update being shoved at me all at the same time you know it would have been nicer to spread it out over a few more weeks

So thats what my day was like How was your day

What a question 

I had an existential crisis but it was much more minor than that Then I met a person even more important than Contessa Lrilatha who was already lots more important than anyone I intended to ever meet and she was perfectly nice but I still feel vaguely like a toddler wandering around a live fire military training exercise going wow such bright lights Then Shrug The ducks tasty

Your food technology is maybe something like three hundred years behind ours I dont even know but I admit its surprisingly good duck given that

My brain is still trying to question all of its life choices and that includes the degree to which Im prioritizing certain forms of personal happiness while working on my very important project I dont Im not sure if I can be the Keltham I was at lunchtime tonight The Keltham whos just running straight ahead and doing the thing because that has different results in dath ilan than in Golarion and I saw that but I also dont know yet what other kind of person I can possibly be I dont know how much you wanted that Keltham you saw before instead of a more unsettled one

I could also just find my brain shaking out if you gave it another hour or starting undressing me I genuinely dont know Ive never been hit by an Owls Wisdom before If I had been this case wouldnt have had such an effect

So not in the mood for winning a kinkiness competition maybe in the mood to climb up to the rooftop and stare at the stars and worry about the fate of the world being on our shoulders

He feels a flash of the old Kelthams enthusiasm at that something that he instinctively cups his hands around like hes protecting a flame from the wind Sounds nice Could do it wearing fewer clothes too if you were also in the mood for that If it escalates on both sides into a perversion competition I sure wont complain Ill also understand if even a relatively minor existential crisis turned out to be a pretty large one in an absolute sense and you just want to stare at the stars

Also whats an existential crisis It doesnt actually translate

Oh its the thing where you think too much about some question humans arent good at thinking about or at least some question no one has taught Golarion humans to be good at thinking about like what youre for or who you want to be or what death will be like and end up having the mental equivalent of the thing where you bite your lip and then have to avoid every time you swallow biting that exact spot again while its swollen 

Ill pick out an outfit for stargazing and well see where it takes us how about that

Works for me

You know the way people think in dath ilan which probably isnt how they should think here its the conventional wisdom that when you can see what youre trying not to think and its gotten to anywhere near the point of a bitten lip youre trying not to bite again youre supposed to just go ahead and think it

This probably assumes theres no rogue corn strains that eat you if you think about them And also that you know how to think about such things and can think about them productively And also that you know people older and more experienced and 4 Intelligence points smarter than you who you can ask for help if you get in trouble And that you can call in a Keeper if that doesnt work

I think in Golarion people trying really hard to think the thoughts theyre at the edges of would just end up going mad or you know not functional enough to do their job at which point they starve what does dath ilan do about it if you are busy having an existential crisis and cant do your job for a month does everyone just have a month of savings

That doesnt sound like something that badly configured thoughts are supposed to do to a person Youd call in a Keeper before then What youre for who you want to be and what the Future makes of you after they bring you back from the dead I wouldnt have thought those were dangerous things to think about either To be clear I am not at all under the impression that means you could tell me your problems and Id see nondangerous things to think about them Ive been in Golarion for longer than an hour at this point

Somebody my age is supposed to save at least a years expenses in investments more if they dont have a support network or the investments are very volatile I was at eighteen months of runway when I boarded my fateful aeroplane but a lot of it was in some pretty volatile investments

Wizards are that rich Most people if they unexpectedly cant earn any money for a year die

Because they cant cut their expenses below what they are to save up more of their income without dying Or because theyre Intelligence 10 and they cant imagine multiple possible futures and plan for them

Mostly the second thing but also it wouldnt obviously be worth it for them to cut their expenses more Cutting their expenses more would increase their odds of dying of other things like living in a worse apartment makes you catch malaria and cholera and so on more often and if you eat worse food then youre weaker and cant fight off illness as well And also living on the bare minimum is kind of miserable and one might reasonably trade off some misery against some chance of dying sooner if they dont think the misery is the useful kind that you learn from and makes you stronger

Right Afterlives Theres no point staying on Golarion if youre not having any fun there

Yeah I mean some of the afterlives suck but Chelish people at least can be pretty sure of their draw and if youre done here not a lot of point hanging around

Keltham can feel it like an echo of Owls Wisdom his explicit awareness his inability not to look in that direction towards his perception that everything hes heard about the afterlife has been very vague and the explicit thought now completed that this is probably not some random innocent mistake its okay to ignore while he plunges ahead into everything else thats more tractable

He wishes he knew whether or not the truth about afterlives was being deliberately hidden from him by the people here or hidden by gods from living nongods in this afterlife feeding economy or if this is some safer issue where itd work fine to try harder to pin people down on details at the expense of some social capital

He doesnt want to pin Carissa down on it anyways Its not a fun pre date topic

Sorry if I shouldnt ask by the way but I cant tell if your mention of meeting somebody more important than Contessa Lrilatha was a prompt to ask you about that if I was interested or if it was deliberately vague to signal that Im not supposed to ask

Mostly just vague because the name wouldnt mean anything to you I met the Grand High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonn the head of the church of Asmodeus on Golarion She was laying the Forbiddance

Meta before I say anything work related about that whats the local defaults and your personal overrides for how much work you want to talk about on the dinner before a date Dath ilani default is that if you met somebody over work work is assumed good to discuss while together unless somebody says otherwise I havent noticed a personal override over that myself

Dath ilan does so much reasoning out which things you do instead of just reading people and noticing if youre getting your desired result It seems like itd be awfully hard not to talk about work considering she says I dont mind it

Right so say anything to Aspexia Rugatonn about work I mean if Id been there Id have asked her what we need to do to get intelligence headbands and a pair of detect magic goggles but theres presumably a reason she didnt deliberately give me a chance to do that and Ill understand if you didnt want to expend your personal social capital on that

I did ask for a headband that was not what she was here to talk about I dont think they are underrating how important you are at least

To Keltham that doesnt sound the least bit unlike what happens if a Legislator is passing through and didnt schedule time for your personal pet issue thats what the whole hierarchy of Delegates Electors and Representatives are for

Yeah not surprising Even the second part is more cheering than I was expecting Maybe not tonight maybe more like early tomorrow but I do want to talk to someone about milestones prices what theyre interested in seeing to create the promise that implies more investment as a correct course of action what it takes to get resources like magic goggles and at least one intelligence headband and wisdom headband to pass around Or failing that if theres enough other clerics here who can go in with me on second circle cleric spells for purposes of hitting everyone who wants it with an Owls Wisdom at least once before they get their head stuffed full of dath ilani skills

Seems like a good conversation to have Carissa is almost certain the constraint on headbands is whether Kelthams going to destroy the world not whether if he doesnt hell create enough value but probably whoever he goes to for the conversation will have figured out what to tell him And she wants a headband very badly so hopefully itll even work out 

Know my next step on who to ask about it Like not necessarily whos in charge if you dont know just who I ask to find out where to go Other people have this weird ability to find security officers that I dont actually see myself anywhere

I just step into hallways and call security and let them show themselves

 right then

You would expect this to be a comedy trope on a TV show which otherwise lacked a mechanical explanation not the way that things worked in real life

Is that a very un dath ilan way for things to work Oh well I know that if we could actually go to dath ilan things would immediately start happening at a thousand times the already terrifying speed theyre presently happening but I sort of wish I could wander around dath ilan not causing an international incident and just seeing what its like

Oh good prioritizing of topics Anybody who wants that to be a romantic conversation should probably get that in with me during the first week or two before I get especially nostalgic or sad about something I didnt realize Id miss Yeah its about as fantastic as youd expect from a billion people with high intelligence and enough money to spend on making stuff be diverse and pretty Enormous buildings that go up into the sky for two hundred layers of living space Weve got those Endless forests with houses youd never notice where all the roads are far enough underground that you cant even hear a murmur from the high velocity automatic carriages moving people around at a mile a minute to their workplace or their friends houses Got that Wind pits a hundred meters on a side so people can fly around using small wings Got them Giant supershop thats fifty of these villas in radius which ended up as the de facto selling point for everything in Civilization thats in common enough demand to need an exhibit and rare enough to not need many of them Got that Entire cities of actors that do nothing but play out unending elaborate fantasies that people can pay to wander into for a day or a year complete with sex workers Got them Its basically what it seems to me you should expect from people with way more money and knowledge and zero magic or gods Given the premise I dont know what if any of that youd find surprising

 longing sigh I dont know that Im surprised by any of those things exactly they all sound like things people might want if they were very rich I guess Im confused about if everyones very rich who does all the unpleasant work of digging the tunnels and hauling the garbage and being the sex workers 

Machines One person can dig a tunnel faster if they have a shovel Now imagine its like that but theres a crew of a hundred people and eighty tunneling machines who show up and dig all the tunnels for the city youre going to build over the course of a week Garbage gets tossed down a self cleaning chute where it lands in containers that get carried away by vehicles that travel around automatically without any humans operating them

Sex workers arent scalable that way because like Civilization has made a decision not to scale orgasm production But I dont know why youd consider that an unpleasant job anyone who sells sex is going to sell it at a price that makes them glad to trade it right and people whod need huge prices to be happy arent going to be the most competitive sex workers Wait this is going to be awful Golarion news and I should be trying to guess it before you say it but I find that I dont actually want to

Do you want me to not say it Cheliax isnt one of the countries where women dont have rights so you dont actually need to know

So somebody picks out the most attractive women tells them theyre sex workers whether they like it or not and underpays them because otherwise their country cant fill out those jobs because no woman wants them because of the marriage thing

 you know I can tell thats still too sensible for Golarion but even having said that I dont know how to make the answer be crazier

If a girl has had sex while unmarried in a country where women are supposed to marry as virgins then no one will marry her but its illegal for her to have been educated or gotten a normal job so she can be a sex worker that does not translate quite directly to our word or she can starve and she will almost definitely get diseases from having sex with lots of strangers and also eventually one of them will be bad news and strangle her but I imagined dath ilan having enough Law to solve the latter problem and enough medicine to solve the former and its still considered a lousy job with those aside because propensity for it is barely getting selected for at all

More equilibria that seem weirdly more awful than anything Keltham knows about to explain why

Why would you get diseases particularly from having sex with people you didnt know Is this a magic thing

 no Its just well you get diseases from any kind of close contact with other people right and there are a bunch of diseases that you specifically get from sex and people who havent had sex wont have those diseases to pass along and people who have sex with hundreds and hundreds of people will inevitably get the diseases eventually

And here thats much more serious than the kind of contagious illnesses that we still have in dath ilan because we eliminated anything we didnt know how to easily treat probably long enough ago that it happened before the screen Though Im a bit confused about the concept of a disease thats specifically transmitted by sex you wouldnt think a disease would find its optimal strategy in only like infecting genitals or sexual fluids and making sure it never got transmitted by sneezing I wonder if theres something Im missing about how the equilibrium point is different here Is it anything you still have to worry about in the face of fourth circle cleric spells

No Remove Disease is third and will totally handle it but normal people cant afford that I dont know enough about why diseases work different ways to guess the answer to your question but doctors do track like if youre doctoring someone with smallpox and havent had it yourself youll catch it if youre doctoring someone with syphilis and havent had it yourself youll be completely fine but their wife and mistress will come down with it eventually

Id guess that a long long time ago in dath ilan we figured out how to identify everyone with a disease like that all at once in one giant sweep through the population and we isolated all of them until they got better or died plus a while longer to be sure and then the disease didnt exist anymore

The concept that you can have a contagious disease forever without it either getting better enough not to be contagious or getting worse until it kills you has not particularly occurred to Keltham why would the replication rate in the face of immune counterattack be exactly 1 rather than exploding or vanishing

Nod I think Cheliax could do that but itd just get reintroduced from other countries that arent coordinated enough

Yeah we wouldnt even have tried until we thought we could pull it off across the whole planet at once so it cant have been any earlier than that in our history I wish I knew whether dath ilan went through a phase like this or if its something that happens here entirely because of the gods or a leak in your heritage of intelligence or I dont know what If dath ilan used to look basically like this minus the gods and magic it sure would be nice to know exactly how we climbed out of it

For the first time it occurs to Keltham to wonder if dath ilan used to have gods and thats what the Great Screen is meant to protect because if you know the info for gods you might pray to them it would take a huge effort to keep not just the phenomenon but the physics behind it out of all the textbooks but thats the magnitude of effort dath ilan put in to the Great Screen And if thats not whats going on then there remains the unexplained question of why Keltham does not know any standard speculations about hypothetical superagents that lots and lots of people could have hypothesized hypotheses which pose a lot of interesting then whats once you start looking in that direction

Anyway Its interesting to know you can have plenty of sex workers if theyre also allowed to do other stuff

Im not sure theres literally anybody on my planet whos not allowed to do other stuff Maybe some Keepers if theyre holding infohazards so bad that they all have to stay in the same isolated village somewhere

And the people who know the true history in their own causally isolated bunker But Keltham is now suddenly very unsure he should talk any more about the Screening of History where gods might hear him If dath ilans Keepers defeated the gods and eradicated their memory sometime in the Forgotten this may not be a good thing to talk about in modern Golarion

Where does the equilibrium balance in Cheliax Keltham adds on You didnt think that people who enjoy sex lots would be the natural sellers for sex so what prevents that here

Well theres still the diseases and theres still the risk of a dangerous guy so its still a job you probably only do if you dont have better options though in Cheliax that wouldnt be because theyre illegal so itd probably be because youre really bad at working in some way or another And if you are particularly attractive and desirable you probably try to angle that into being a powerful persons mistress rather than working at a brothel even a high end one

And the gaps are filled by slavery which shes not going to say 

Oh in dath ilan its that sufficiently attractive people who are sufficiently good at sex have formed um A temporal process with two sides where each side is composed of people who each have their own incentives such that each side is in equilibrium with respect to the incentives given to them by the other side and on the other side from the very desirable people are people who are sufficiently cool and have done sufficiently awesome things You cant buy some very hot people with money youve got to have done something that they think is worthy And the people who are obviously worthy if theyre willing to acknowledge you publicly as a fuckbuddy theyre validating to the world that you are that hot and that good at sex and then youre somebody who gets to decide whether some lesser incredibly rich person is cool enough to meet your standards

Carissa tries to follow that and when that fails tries to nail down her confusion and when that fails says reluctantly maybe thats the same thing as taking a mistress but I suspect instead its another vast confusing cultural divide

Okay suppose I asked you who was the hottest woman on the planet The first obvious answer would be whoever gets paid the highest prices for sex But suppose theres somebody even hotter than her who doesnt accept direct payment for sex at all How could you tell she was even hotter How could she prove that to the world Well lets say she thinks the big important thing is research on rats and suppose somebody incredibly rich goes and builds an entire small city devoted to rat research and then she screws him Depending on how much money gets spent especially if shes influencing multiple rich people to fund rat research you could make the case that shes getting implicitly paid more than the most expensive direct sex worker on the planet even if shes only a small fraction of the reason why anyone funded the rat research city

 this is missing the point but in Golarion youd check with a spell who had the most Splendour Uh Im not sure thats how I think about sexual desirability working I dont think how hot someone is relates very directly to how much I expect to gain from having sex with them and therefore how motivated I am to do it And Im also not sure thats the main place where the confusion is

Do people here not have I dont know the kind of pride in their own desirability and sexual skill where they want to prove that theyre way better at it than most other people Because you cant just go around saying that youve got to prove it somehow

Carissa is pretty sure that the more powerful you are the less you need skill at sex Shes suddenly worried that she shouldnt say that either though yes but that correlates with not being very powerful or in demand and therefore with needing to establish that youre fun to have sex with if you want to get anyone to have sex with you at all she says tentatively after a bit of thought

Keltham is not sure what the communications obstacle could be here exactly I mean its a two sided equilibrium containing the hottest people and the worthiest people who mutually judge each other as that anchored by how hotness and worthiness are also somewhat visible to people outside their ingroups I have a sense like Im also missing the point If youre hot enough that powerful people are competing to sleep with you you dont need to establish how hot you are anymore the outside world has now seen it established

Im going to talk about some place other than Cheliax first because I keep getting distracted by trying to apply this conversation to our date and by worrying about saying something that youll be incredibly concerned and offended by So Osirion Osirion has a god king a pharaoh theyve had them since ancient times The pharaoh of Osirion has hundreds of concubines If he sees a hot girl in the street I think he can just order her to become one of them Its not particularly validating to be chosen by the pharaoh of Osirion because it just means that youre either in the top couple hundred or that he was tired of the top couple hundred and wanted something new I am absolutely not in the top percentile of hotness for women but if I went to Osirion Id be a little worried about getting noticed because Im exotic which is sometimes appealing in its own right

Does all of that make sense are we starting to make different predictions at some place after that 

I mean youve convinced me that no woman would want to go to Osirion and if she did she wouldnt expect to gain positive sexual reputation from being selected by the pharaoh because the pharaoh isnt discriminating enough but Im now distracted by the question of why there is such a thing as a pharaoh of Osirion in the first place

 as a question about history the answer is that his grandfather staged a nearly bloodless coup against the satrap of the Kelish Empire with the churches of Abadar and Sarenrae both backing him right after Aroden fell when the empire was very distracted and won Osirion independence and kicked out all the Kelish nobles and ended serfdom and is wildly popular I am not sure thats the question you were asking though 

Suppose everybody in a dath ilani city woke up one day with the knowledge mysteriously inserted into their heads that their city had a pharaoh who was entitled to order random women off the street into his cuddling chambers whether they liked that or not Suppose that they had the false sense that things had always been like this for decades It wouldnt even take until whenever the pharaoh first ordered a woman for her to go Wait why am I obeying this order when Id rather not obey it Somebody would be thinking about city politics first thing when they woke up in the morning and theyd go Wait why we do we have a pharaoh in the first place and within an hour not only would they not have a pharaoh theyd have deduced the existence of the memory modification because their previous history would have made no sense and then the problem would escalate to Exception Handling and half the Keepers on the planet would arrive to figure out what kind of alien invasion was going on Is the source of my confusion at all clear here

You think everyone in dath ilan would just decide not to follow orders even though this would get them executed if anyone else in the system continued following orders on the confident assumption that no person with a correctly configured mind would possibly decide to follow orders under those circumstances

Oh so were imagining that people also wake up with the memory that everybodys supposed to kill anyone who talks about removing the pharaoh and the memory that theyre supposed to kill anyone who doesnt kill anyone who talks about removing the pharaoh and so on through recursion and they wake up with the memory of everybody else having behaved like that previously Yeah thats one of the famous theoretical bad equilibria that we get training in how to 

Shit

 confusion resolved now

Just Osirion or entire planet outside Cheliax No its at least also Nidal

Everywhere has people in charge who do things you wouldnt like and stay in charge because its illegal to overthrow them and the laws are enforced Exactly how bad the things they do are varies the pharaoh of Osirion is actually not considered bad at all and exactly how the laws against overthrowing the government are enforced varies but probably even in Cheliax the government has done something dath ilan thinks would merit overthrowing it

But for that to be true in Cheliax that makes no sense in terms of dath ilani common wisdom about how evil aliens would enforce that equilibrium theyd require non dissidents to kill dissidents immediately before the timing info NOW can spread at the speed of local speech maybe theyre too dumb here to realize that

If you were supposed to have killed me a few seconds ago Keltham says in a casual tone not any kind of obvious whisper and are putting your own life in danger not to do that this would be a great time to casually nod your head and then Ill censor a lot of my curriculum from here on out

Carissa is completely insanely tempted to casually nod her head even though thats not even at all lots of countries do still have governments and dont enforce heresy laws and its clearly one of those theyre pretending at being 

I think you are imagining that this equilibrium is extremely fragile and that admitting were in it is also disallowed But actually its extremely sticky Overthrowing governments is really really hard and usually the thing that results when you overthrow a government is much worse The consequences of overthrowing the Chelish government would be bad ones So you dont have to pretend the government is perfect you just have to have a critical mass of people who dont believe that overthrowing it would produce something better especially not since the Chelish government is possible to improve in normal ways by like suggesting improvements

I see Keltham says Because if you toss out the current equilibrium it could disrupt a lot of stuff especially in a place like Golarion where people who lose a years income just starve no safety margin for anything and if the current equilibrium is also doing some good things 

But it should be REALLY REALLY OBVIOUS that theres an alternative to Osirion which looks like Osirion WITHOUT THE PHARAOH RAPING PEOPLE and that you could just 

Well the people here dont have any training in noticing better equilibria and figuring out how to move to them 

NO THATS JUST OBJECTIVELY OBVIOUS

Keltham manages not to yell this out loud and having now finished internally yelling insults at reality continues looking externally thoughtful grateful for his recent practice with Eagles Splendour

He is not going to say anything along those lines however obvious until he has picked up from books whether Cheliax has a pharaoh Or rather what kind of pharaoh it has

He is specifically not going to mention that given a dath ilani training regimen ten year olds are too smart to get stuck in traps like this and would wait until the next solar eclipse or earthquake at which point 10 of them would yell NOW followed moments later by the other 90 as is the classic strategy that children spontaneously and independently invent as soon as prompted by this scenario so long as they have been previously taught about Schelling points

Has he at any point mentioned out loud dath ilans annual Oops Its Time To Overthrow The Government Festival He doesnt think so

 because okay so there are lots of people who benefit from the current system right The pharaoh has personal bodyguards who he personally raised from the dead after they died in his service The pharaoh has people who he elevated to high ranking positions All of those people would be worse off if the government were overthrown so for practical reasons they are going to oppose it So in order to overthrow the government you have to kill all those people and also any people who are seeking out positions of importance in the government as a reward for their loyalty in putting down the rebellion and also any people who have sworn oaths of loyalty to the current regime 

I see In dath ilan wed think that its hard to get over half of the military power on your side by bribing it in a pre metallic equilibrium where almost all fighters have about the same military power And that once you start gaining more knowledge and get more powerful tech its your important duty to also use that knowledge to propagate certain kinds of stable equilibria to future generations and not others

But with wizards and clerics and whatever else you have here if theyre extraordinary economics you dont have the word if they let individuals do big things without large support networks you could get half plus of the military power by appealing to fewer people Even while your societys knowledge was much too primitive to produce the kind of advanced weapons that would make these issues initially appear in nonmagical societies that have started figuring things out

That does make it seem less like the whole thing is just an Intelligence 10 Phenomenon

 yeah the pharaoh and a hundred high level personal bodyguards could probably kill practically the entire rest of the country put together commoners are pretty useless against high level wizards and clerics Certainly more than fifty percent of a countrys military power is less than a thousand people

Well I think Im starting to understand some of the ways that Golarion diverged from a human baseline because of the presence of magic Or I have the illusion of starting to understand at least one of those divergences It is not by our standards pretty but it sure beats having no idea why nothing here is making any sense

 if you introduce technology into a Punish Non Punishers society with magic the situation is no longer stable it has a possibility of transitioning to the kind of pharaoh free Civilization that Keltham is familiar with if very large supply networks and only those can build weapons powerful enough to kill high level wizards and clerics But yeah Keltham is going to have to think about how to do that with a minimum of fuss and maybe not say a whole lot while hes thinking

Carissa can in fact follow the way Keltham might be reasoning and shes pretty sure that she screwed up even though claiming that every single country except Cheliax was like this would have been ridiculous and even though shes actually pretty sure that Keltham isnt going to change the calculus of whether its a good idea to overthrow the government 

Anyway sometimes it does go wrong and someones power base isnt secure enough Like in Tian Xia the Lung Wa empire which had endured for centuries collapsed after Arodens death because there was a massive associated natural disaster and a famine and the empire collapsed and everything is much worse now Ive met Tian adventurers and they tell stories about ghost cities where everyone just left or died because trade routes were disrupted and food stopped coming an entire country that made a pact with a kraken to be its slaves other areas where the civil war still hasnt ended even though there are very few people left to kill each other I am sure that the Emperor of Imperial Lung Wa did some things youd abhorr but itd be monstrous to overthrow him to throw cities and civilizations and twenty million lives into the chasm of Chaos just to stop a couple dozen people from getting raped 

Shes doing such a bad job at being more Evil shes going to have to set some time aside tomorrow to work on that

I try not to be the stupid kind of Chaotic Even Chaos is made almost entirely of Law remember If youre doing it correctly In fact Im beginning to think that the top 01 most Chaotic dath ilani on my planet placed on a scale with one unit of distance between what you consider Lawful and Chaotic would be located one hundred and forty four units further to the Lawful side of what you call Lawful

That seems probably right I just it sounds like youre thinking about goverments as things that mostly maintain their power by making it too hard for people to correctly overthrow them when my impression is that actually most people correctly dont want to overthrow them and I can name six countries where I think thats not true so I dont think Im just incapable of recognizing it when I see it and its not how I see Cheliax Or Osirion for that matter Though I do think stealing all their women would be incredibly satisfying and we should do it

Stable governments make the expected benefit of overthrowing them look smaller than the expected friction costs of coordinating and changing the regime yes Friction costs are not fixed independently of tech level

Where do gods fit into this Theres a Lawful Neutral god that sponsors Osirion the same god that took over the planetary banking system I imagine that god doesnt care whether people benefit themselves or benefit others its just completely indifferent to the effect of laws on citizen welfare all it cares about is that there be laws confirm or more likely deny my guess

She STILL hasnt been told whether to tell him hes Abadars Abadars not one of the more human gods but I think doesnt care whether people benefit themselves or benefit others sounds right and uh not exactly indifferent to whether laws affect human welfare and more deeply concerned with laws along a specific dimension which is not human welfare but definitely isnt just laws exist I bet it matters that theyre possible to consistently enforce and that theyre consistently obeyed And I bet there are other things that matter which I just dont happen to know

The info he needs is to what extent gods both including and excluding Asmodeus are liable to get pissed if Keltham tries to make their afterlife feeder be less of a shithole Keltham is aware he cant immediately ask about this though it also occurs to him that Carissa may be similarly speculating about Kelthams intentions and not saying what she speculates hes thinking

Gosh Keltham hopes they werent supposed to be coordinating some kind of immensely meaningful implied side conversation while they were talking about this because if so Keltham has absolutely no idea what they both sidespoke and that would be embarrassing Well not really his fault because of the enormous cultural gap and hypothetical Carissa should have known better but still

Wanna go back to talking sex work in dath ilan Keltham offers

Sure Do women pay for it They dont in Golarion its not hard to find someone wholl have sex with you for free

Some women do I should also mention that theres a difference between like slipping some normal man or woman a private note saying that you realize youve failed at flirting with them but you still want them enough that youd pay thirty unskilled labor hours to fuck them anyways versus paying much higher prices to extremely attractive people who are extremely good at sex The second thing is more of a case of something you do when youre older richer can afford it on a regular basis if you dont want to go back to less expert sex and arent concerned about it messing up your regular relationships Ive resorted to bribery six times and been bribed twice but the total money flow ratio is more like twenty to one not three to one

 that with normal non professionals is not a thing in Cheliax and I suppose it could be I dont actually know why it isnt I guess since no one does it offering would be extremely weird and therefore a negative signal about the traits of the person who offered Itd read as a bizarre threat is what itd read as Id be cautious about doing that here not that I expect youll need to

Thanks for the warning Anything else I shouldnt offer people money to do

Huh good question Im not immediately thinking of anything else 

Normally I would say you shouldnt offer people money to overthrow the government that actually is illegal but what with it being you I think its probably better if your controlling constraint isnt believing yourself to have necessarily incomplete information about the merits of overthrowing governments

 and now were back on serious topics sorry What sorts of things do you do in a whole city of sex workers do you pretend to be the pharaoh of Osirion 

You mean and then the women overthrow him and take sexual revenge on him Or played straight rather than subverted I mean Im sure somebody has played Perverted Alien Dictator of Civilization and probably a hundred thousand variations on it I dont know myself very much of what goes on in there Theres a standard wisdom of play the simple sex games first wait to get bored naturally before you start making sex more complicated dont rush ahead to the weirdest sex Civilization has developed

Its considered the kind of info hazard that isnt going to drive you insane but can make you miss out on a lot of fun by making you bored before you wouldve been bored Like telling somebody how a book ends when they just started reading it We have whole Civilizational structures around avoiding that class of lesser infohazards spoilers theyre called With for example simple codes you only memorize after you pass a competence check for a threshold level of sexual experience so newspapers can print sentences that only sufficiently perverted people would be able to read without making a deliberate effort

 huh I guess thats fair enough Does this mean that you should not be doing kinkiness challenges because Golarion doesnt have such a norm and adventurers tend to tell stories about what theyve gotten up to

Eh New planet Ill get used to whats normal here Maybe dont spring it on me all at once and leave some for next time

Actually Im not quite sure what kind of perversion kinky is I can tell its like sexual diversity but the word doesnt directly translate Surprising me is fine to be clear

I mean its sort of a general word for everything thats not you know one man and one woman with no implements and no magic

That covers an awful lot of space by itself I wouldve said but maybe Im naive about how much more people get up to in their forties once they can afford nicer things and more participants

I mean I think people who tend to like tying people up also tend to like whipping them also tend to like dripping candle wax on them also tend to like having two of em you can get to do things with each other and also tend to like using control spells on them so it forms a sort of natural category Shrug Maybe the category is just general the thing you are calling perversion

Okay havent done any of that and if it ever got mentioned in the newspapers it was encrypted

Wait WHAT

Itd have to go awfully wrong to get mentioned in the newspapers

Under other circumstances Id say surprise me but what exactly is whipping Whats a candle I cant quite make things out through this translation spell but whipping sounds like pain and candles sound like fire I feel obliged to check that these activities wont require that we pay to resurrect each other afterwards

Whipping is painful but like in a sexy way not in a deadly way Candles are a tiny bit of fire people who dont have magic use them for lighting and their wax melts at a low temperature so theyre also painful but a sexy amount not an injurious amount Were not even talking about things youd need healing for though people do in fact get into things youd need healing for

Okay and the concept is that you and I hire a member of some non human species that doesnt mind having it done to them

Its going to be so fascinating to settle some bets among your research group

Uh Humans are often into being hurt in the context of sex because pain is an intense experience and with the right surrounding context can be fun

 okay I checked in with my inner self and if theres some later stage of my life where I would want to be tied up and hurt in a sexual context I havent at all gone down the path that leads there In fact my self seems to be sort of weirdly violently against that happening to me to a degree greater than Id expect from small amounts of pain Ive paid pain costs in nonsexual contexts but this was just like a very loud inner NOPE I hope thats not too disappointing

Men are more often the other way around if anything and its the other way around weve got a betting pool on Whether you like inflicting pain on interested parties in a sexual context I have no idea how you were not aware that was a thing cashes out for that

I dont see why men or women would want to be hurt in terms of the human mind design and the reproductive pressures producing it that Im familiar with pain is the damage signal its the sum of what we avoid so that we wont die and fail to have children are you someone who enjoys pain inflicted on you in a sexual context

 point of theology Cheliax conceives of pain as significantly more than just a damage signal not that being sexually into pain is limited to Cheliax or people who share our theology or is even significantly more common here I suspect its innate I have enjoyed pain in the context of sex though the atmosphere matters a lot youd ah have to be good at it

Okay let me check in with what my brain thinks of pulling your hair in a sexual context if you enjoyed that in a sexual way and YEP somebody just won their bets on me alright

Oh good

Huh

Im reasonably sure that dath ilan never wanted me to notice that about myself

 huh

I guess dath ilans really Good but that seems like one of the context where Goods just obnoxious

Stuff in dath ilan doesnt happen without a reason Its not Golarion Let me think about this

Point one If the desire to inflict pain in a sexual context is sufficiently a human universal and sufficiently common that somebody on this plane of existence can spot the signs in Keltham before he knows them himself the Keepers know about this already The probability of this need not be evaluated its a flat fact

Point two Not only has Keltham not been told about this Keltham has never been exposed to any sexual education or priming which would cause him to think if he did notice this fact about himself that it was a good idea to pursue that thought further People dont want to be hurt that is sort of what hurting is

Having a strong sexual desire to inflict pain according to everything that dath ilan has taught Keltham about the world would mean that any attempt to satisfy this desire would involve an unusually mentally resilient sex worker being paid a lot of money to put up with a sexual experience that she didnt like If he got addicted if his whole sexuality turned into that the rest of his romantic life would suck really hard and probably never be truly satisfying again That would have been the obvious prediction going on the obvious intuitive reasoning Keltham would have done from everything Civilization ever taught him

The thought that the world was full of other people who were the complements of that desire who wanted to be sexily hurt would just straightforwardly have never occurred to Keltham at all if hed spotted that desire in himself

That makes the answer obvious doesnt it

All he needs to do is guess first that Civilization prefers not to lie and second that natural selection in dath ilan worked the way it obviously intuitively should By default organisms dont like pain and pain is what they dont like

Dath ilan has people who want to inflict pain sexually It doesnt have the people who want to be sexily hurt Im not sure why they exist in Golarion but whatever that reason was it didnt operate in dath ilan Thats why I was never supposed to notice

 huh You know that actually sort of follows one explanation Ive seen for enjoying pain being more common in women is that it improves the odds of surviving rape and sexual slavery and then the thing you talked about in class about who has more children 

Carissa is having the somewhat upsetting realization that maybe it would be bad for dath ilani people if they went to Hell if theyve just completely eradicated the mechanism by which their brains translate pain into something more complex than just suffering

I could wish these congratulations came under nicer circumstances but congratulations anyways youre learning to operate the theory validly

I mean I already knew about the bad stuff I just didnt know we were getting anything good out of it And I think we are Getting something good out of it that is something Id definitely arrange for heredity optimization to keep having wow I bet in Nidal its everyone 

I hope youre right about everyone in Nidal enjoying it but even Im starting to notice that sounds a little optimistic for Golarion

Oh Nidal is horrible and I bet everyone there is miserable but I also bet that they have near universal sex related pain enjoyment sex related pain enjoyment doesnt give you context free enjoyment of all pain I did not enjoy getting punished for bad grades and Ive had sex with a girl who was into hurting me more than I could handle and that wasnt fun either

Blue and orange Keltham thinks as he notices it explicitly this time how theres an alien reality here that doesnt make sense and his brain is trying to force it But he doesnt know the thread to pull to unravel this whole knot all he can do is wibble the fringes of it

If you dont have money flows to make up for relationships that would be imbalanced like that is there some class of things okay to trade that arent money that you were getting out of that relationship instead

Yes people trade favors protection in that specific case a spell I really really wanted Its not that people dont have sex for reasons located outside the sex they do that all the time its just culturally rather unheard of to name a specific amount of money as a bid and its also traditional for it to be a bit ambiguous how much you are doing for what reasons

Hes going to wait until later in case its somehow wrong and wronger if done in public to ask Carissa how much hair pulling he can trade for how much explanation of how the ass the flirting norms here actually work

Yeah dath ilan has all kinds of dating ambiguity and mindgames like youd imagine from people with high intelligence and a lot more spare time but the concept of never naming specific amounts of money its so not dath ilan I cant easily convey it Anything worth anything is worth money Not just money in general a specific amount of money Its the unit of caring in our parlance

Yes I am not surprised that dath ilan prefers forthrightness on the value transfer elements of sex and flirting even if they like ambiguity elsewhere I can see how youd get used to it even But I think if you do it here youll just confuse people terribly

Is it literally just money or do I have to be careful not to offer anybody anything such that it would have a well defined resale value 

That is definitely sometimes done spells have a resale value but there are nuances and I might recommend running it by someone else first

Is such conversation also bad on the metalevel If I asked everyone whod be the best person to ask about which sexual offers are and arent offensive is that question itself even more offensive

Keltham has noticed that Golarion can sometimes be effectively predicted by asking himself how he would design a social protocol as badly as possible

This conversation is fine That question is fine I promise we are not entirely made of impossibilities

Well congratulations to Golarion on passing the bar that he set literally as low as he could imagine on short notice but its sure an improvement on undershooting it so hell take what he can get

I think Im pretty much done with my dinner myself You

Im done Up to the rooftops Or have you rediscovered your sex drive in the course of this conversation

Good question Keltham turns his attention inward not quite able to stop himself from thinking how much clearer that perception was under Owls Wisdom how much easier and fuller the seeing of Keltham by Keltham

It sure is more there than it was when I walked in maybe half from time passing and half from discovering high payoff sexual options I never imagined possible Still I think I want to start off the evening a little slower and spending at least some time on the rooftop sounds good

Are people in dath ilan just that candid and self aware all the time How do they live Rooftop it is Assuming we can find it Do you want to ask security right away or go exploring ourselves Normally the second would be a stunningly dangerous thing to do but security isnt going to let Keltham get exploded by a stray internal defensive measure

Lets explore Though Im trusting you that misguided exploration is either knowably not fatal or that theyd resurrect us without too much fuss

Oh okay shed been worried that this sort of thing is dangerous is something thatd have him all shocked and appalled about what societies outside dath ilan are like but apparently its allowed I expect this place has defenses that might in fact be fatal if triggered but that they have been very thoroughly disabled Chelish securitys not stupid and they dont want you to die And if you did theyd resurrect you but Im not relying too much on that because Ill be in lots of trouble if I get you killed even though itll take all of ten minutes to fix

Keltham rises from the table Shall we

Yeah You know I figured I would live my whole life without getting to poke around a Dukes villa I am very excited

Your lead then

Carissa would attempt to trot up the massive entryhall staircase in a sexy way except shes not actually sure she knows how to do that its a skillset that definitely exists and that she has witnessed on display but not one shes had occasion to practice and trying and failing to do it is pathetic The natural default mode for exploring is more cautious giggly childlike and that is appealing in its own way maybe to Keltham too but not sexy and shes going to be kind of dissatisfied if 

 one thing at a time The massive entryhall staircase opens out onto a luxurious mezzanine and then there are two wings with rooms presumably parlors and bedrooms and guest rooms and so on and no obvious staircase up though she knows that this place has some towers Do you have a sense of where the towers were relative to where we are

Keltham tries to visualize the villa as seen from the courtyards they sometimes pass through I dont think I actually remember but I think theres a tower visible from a courtyard I think is that way and then wed know He gestures in a direction

Hes considering offering to hold hands but maybe Cheliax considers handholding an unreasonably advanced form of erotic perversion practiced by only the most sexually degenerate individuals only if he keeps asking about that sort of thing at every step thatll take all night but also holding hands seems not optimal for exploring and potentially sort of awkward for maneuvering and do they even do that here and 

Yeah all right lets try in that direction

Off they go then

He still hasnt asked about holding hands

Carissa cant read his mind Though she is aware that paradigmatic flirting in most places involves physical contact so they can brush against each other maybe in tight spaces which she can probably find if she tries hard and believes in herself oh heres a servants hallway meant for halflings and very cozy 

I WOULD APPRECIATE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE TOWER AND WILL PAY YOU SOMETHING REASONABLE FOR THEM she thinks loudly at security

Elias Abarco hates this particular girl by now but thats all the more reason to take a deal like that Door on your left he whispers when shes far enough ahead Keltham wont hear it

Carissa doesnt even expect to regret this Asmodeus personally is interested in her trajectory 

The door on her left opens in her hand though she wouldnt have expected it to and its a grand bedroom with a four poster bed with sweeping velvet drapes and a fireplace and a sitting room and a dog bed fancier than anything Carissas ever slept on And it has a staircase up a neat little spiral staircase with carpeted steps 

Bit weird and sparse for a bedroom but everything here is like that Stairs Is that as tower promising as it looks to an outsider from another dimension

In this dimension too stairs often lead up to towers

It would be wise to try to arrange incidental physical contact here But she doesnt think of handholding because thats not really a thing

Keltham has been thinking thoughts along not entirely dissimilar lines and tries to match his steps to Carissa such that if she was okay with that they could try both going up these stairs in quite close proximity If she seems to be falling behind or pulling ahead he wont fight that of course

No no they can go up the stairs together brushing shoulders a slightly unnecessary amount 

Theres something profoundly strange here and she doesnt know what it is Maybe its just the role reversal that usually people are trying to seduce her Maybe its just that hes very young and she hasnt dated teenagers since she was one mostly at the Worldwound the interesting people have a decade on her because thats what makes them interesting all the magic they know maybe an adult dath ilani would be running rings around all of them and thats why Asmodeus picked a teenager 

And then theyre out at the top of the tower Cheliax is not industrially advanced enough to have light pollution The sky is very bright and very clear 

Dath ilan is too good at coordination to have either lots of aerosols in the atmosphere or lots of high scattering non red lights on at night all the time and Keltham has ever been a tourist in clear cold high places where the stars are brighter yet Its not a new sight to him except of course in the sense that 

The patterns of the suns are different Keltham murmurs He didnt get around to checking last night with all the various rushes I was wondering if this was a branched time of my own planet in my own Taldane doesnt have a word that means galaxy larger structure of suns Didnt seem likely but anyway its definitely not Dath ilan doesnt have the notion of constellations in quite the same way but he doesnt see any of the patterns that a dath ilani would use to identify the Northern Star or Southern Center or the direction of a meteor shower

I think youre from farther away than any of those stars A very good wizard can teleport to those and not to dath ilan

Thats incredibly impressive we were not ready to go anywhere and come back not for a while it would have been insanely expensive even by our own standards We built hugely powerful beams of light and used that to launch probes toward the second nearest sun just to get started on practicing but they wont get to their destinations for a long time We did it just because we could in the end and not for not for reasons really

We were pretty sure there was nobody else anywhere near our neighborhood in any sun close enough for light to travel to us from there People did some clever calculations saying that the aliens were probably a few billion years out in our simultaneity all with logic and calculations that dont apply here at all if your wizards can teleport there and back in less than years Find any people around the other suns or is it all just lifeless other planets the way wed deduced in our own world

The other planets around our sun are all settled but thats happened at the same time as us it wasnt an independent event From farther than that uh Ive heard it claimed the crashed ship that is quarantined in Numeria came from another sun but I dont know more about that Aroden when he was an epic hero spent thousands of years looking and came back with empty hands

It feels so unreal to think of that as being something one person does Wed have millions of people investigating a question like that if a possible alien invasion had happened it would take millions of people One person becoming powerful enough to go to the stars on their own is a story you write and only sell to adults because if you told it to children youd be setting them up for disappointment when they learned how economics worked in real life This place really is magic just like we tell it in stories where I come from

 hand on his arm

I hope it doesnt seem like an entirely horrible place to you It needs some work but but its work a person can do if thats what you mean by magic it doesnt take millions 

He leans gently in that direction which is hopefully a signal that its fine Eh frankly its pretty horrible So lots of room for improvement and unspendably vast riches if I can figure out how to collect a five percent fee on five percent of the improvements

His brain takes this moment to wonder if Owls Wisdom would have something else to say about this stereotypically Keltham response and Keltham tells it to shut up and come back later Also no because that is who Keltham is in another world on a basic level and even if he later decides he was wrong about some things that wont poof him into an random average dath ilani

It is much less horrible than dath ilan where people can die forever if their brains are destroyed not having that argument because in her heart she suspects shed lose it probably a similar percentage of people manage to go to Abaddon and get eaten And because having arguments isnt sexy 

What to say then though Well Ive heard more unrealistic ambitions

Who is it that has me beat on this metric and how I may have to adjust my aim upwards

Some people are planning to run the Starstone as soon as they can fly and become a god or die trying

Nah Im more ambitious than that Some people succeed at running the Starstone right And yet your worlds still an enormous messy mess of messiness So fixing the world is obviously harder Plus I mean if youre going to die and go to an afterlife anyways why wouldnt you run the Starstone How does that even take ambition and not just plain old opportunism

The people who die running the Starstone dont always go to the afterlives They usually do but every once in a while one or two percent theyre just gone No one knows what the difference is Its not the chanciest chance you could take but Id just die personally

Yeah I havent really been thinking about it because I reflexively decided that it was a Keeper sort of question but I had a thing happen to me that was supposed to obliterate my own consciousness and here I am It kind of suggests that maybe people are in enough different places that theres always some of them left whatever happens to them By the end of my biological lifespan Ill probably have the most expensive intelligence headband and the most expensive Owls Wisdom headband and maybe then Ill be able to think about that sensibly even if theres no Keepers around And then decide whether I want to go to the afterlife here that I seem to be headed for or if I want to optimize for Neutral Evil so I can go on to whatever place comes next in the sequence whose zero is dath ilan and whose first successor is Golarion

I 

 that doesnt make any sense to me but I guess it wouldnt I am not very willing to trade off definitely not dying against many other things

Woulda said the same before I died in a plane crash that couldnt possibly have failed to utterly obliterate my brain Im pretty sure I remember my head being ripped off my neck in the crash before I found myself in Golarion instead Im sure that sounds like small potatoes to your own standards of what people come back from but where I come from it was supposed to be permanent

And it wasnt

Dying in a plane crash is something that youd expect to obliterate every brain of every copy of you across all the branches of branching time inside the universe as conventionally understood If there was still some of me left after that 

Well its suggestive of some weird things being true That would then by shaky extrapolation go on being true if something else happened that would otherwise obliterate my presence within Golarion as conventionally understood

But Im not actually going to try to figure it out without more intelligence and wisdom headbands after Im older if those are actual options here Handing that job to your future self seems like the equivalent of saying to wait and ask a Keeper

 nod My working theory has been that Asmodeus grabbed a copy somehow or something which would have been fantastically expensive but maybe still the best way to explain to us what were doing wrong I dont know if that changes any of your reasoning or if its just true that some other god somewhere else might be grabbing people from Abaddon

Well the obvious thought is that your universe is my universes physics plus magic and can see my universe from here and by mediocrity is probably part of a vast lattice containing lots of other universes that can see my universe and then this universe is one thats visible from universes that look like this universe plus even more magic and maybe mostly when somebody dies in Abaddon nothing happens but theres a vast number of double magical universes and some tiny fraction of those have a god or a glitch or a whatever that materializes another copy of the person who just got eaten

Assuming they get eaten quickly and not by their minds getting chewed up a bit at a time so that their consciousness turns into a small painful simple thing before it ends Theres a disease like that in dath ilan that slowly degrades your consciousness if you let it run until it kills you taking away your memories year by year People usually go into cryonic suspension immediately if they find out they have it I also need to know more about Abaddon besides solving metaphysics before I start treating Abaddon as an exit route

Seems worth noting though that if the gods also think thats how Abaddon works that the people who end there just wake up someplace else the same as I did it could explain why the gods arent treating it as more of an emergency

I think Asmodeus has expended a fair number of resources to make sure everyone headed there is offered the choice of Hell instead But I dont know if thats because He considers Abaddon death an emergency or because He wants them in Hell instead I have never heard its slow but I havent asked either if people die brain damaged in this world theyre normal in the next one the soul remembers more 

Yeah but just because theres somebody walking around who remembers being the person who got damaged and then got better doesnt mean that from a first person perspective if you get damaged enough to forget who you are then that experiencer mostly experiences becoming you again Thats why people go into cryonic suspension right away if they get Memory Degrading Disorder Sure future tech might be enough to read back the memories you lost but that doesnt mean that you experience turning back into you after youve simplified and shrunk to the point where you cant tell yourself apart from a lot of other people with Memory Degrading Disorder You might experience turning into somebody else instead This language is really not suited to discussing this subject matter but then its not much suited to discussing anything else either

 huh Im not sure thats what I care about If I got slowly tortured out of having distinctly me experiences but a bunch of copies of me from before that were still around I dont think Id be very upset about that I havent considered this very much maybe to dath ilani people its obvious why I should care about that more than about whether theres still a me

Blue and orange I would in fact be quite upset about any Kelthams being slowly tortured out of having distinctly me experiences even if I was one of the ones who survived unharmed I may be selfish but not to the point of intertemporal conflicts with my own copies from a few minutes earlier

 Carissa is not sure she understands that objection thoroughly enough to be sure her reasons for not minding arent very Chelish 

I mean I expect I would find being tortured aversive its in the definition but the thing that makes torture which makes me no longer distinctly me far far far worse than torture which doesnt have that effect is that then the things I think of as Carissa dont exist anymore at all And if Carissa will keep existing no matter what but some threads of her end I dont understand why Id mind Maybe Id mind if I understood

Yeah that makes some sense 

Sorry Its just that the thing you said sounded a bit similar to an argument my mother once tried on me about how a further implication of selfishness was that I shouldnt care about what happened to the Keltham of tomorrow because he was a slightly different person from me so screw him and Im finally in the region thats supposed to be Evil now but then you said that you didnt care about and it just sounded like sorry

This all probably doesnt sound very romantic escalatory does it Sorry bout that I was somewhat better at dates in dath ilan when I knew all the conventions My respect for you being the woman who decided to fling herself on the sharp kitchen knife of my early learning experiences

 Carissas going to not touch that because once again shes not sure that the thing Kelthams pointing at is not a true thing about Cheliax shes supposed to be hiding 

How to flirt back though

I can flirt with people who have magic items for it can read your face so closely they might as well be able to read your mind who have magic that does more than Splendour I have done that though not very much because I tried not to get in over my head at the Worldwound there wasnt anything there worth getting in over my head for but I want you see you think like no one in this universe and it feels possible that I could think like that too not after the centuries of perfecting itll take me to be Contessa Lrilatha but like next year sooner if I can squeeze a headband out of somebody and I want you so you dont actually have to be good at flirting unless you yourself get in the mood by flirting deftly at people in which case I suppose you had better get good at it

Keltham leans in to her and grins broadly even if she maybe cant see it Well thanks for taking all the uncertainty and plot tension out of our flirting then Where I come from theres enough distinct books on romantic theory to fill this houses library ten times over and most of them would say that just giving away the ending makes it be less fun but right now my experiences would seem to be falsifying that I dont think that cuddling you on a roof and looking up at the stars is even slightly less fun if I know I cant fail

Well you could fail at the planet sized ambitions maybe we can get enough plot tension out of that And there is still the question of who will win the sexual varieties contest though I have to say Im optimistic

Not betting Ill win but not giving up without any fight And by the way things would be different if I had access to my own worlds technology just saying

Is there sex technology Thats delightful actually We will have to fix things up enough that we too can have sex technology dont tell me what the sex technology does I want to try to guess

I dont even know what 1 of 01 of all the sex technology does just the incredibly basic stuff thats in almost every cuddleroom and that everyone gets training in how to use But if you imagine something I can probably take a pretty good guess as to whether it existed Using the simple rule that if it sounds possible to our technology level somebody somewhere has done it and if it doesnt sound possible theres still a 70 chance somebody has done it

Sex in midair

Probability 1 Giant windpits people going up very high in aeroplanes and jumping out and having sex on the way down people getting into orbit around the planet and having sex there

 wouldnt jumping out of airplanes kill you without magic 

Nah somebody in pre Screened history but hes trying to call less attention to that just thought for another couple of minutes and figured out how to survive it without magic Im pretty sure we do a lot of stuff you imagine takes magic For jumping out of airplanes you fold up a giant cloth into a backpack and when youre getting near the ground you unfold it and it catches the air and slows your fall Ive been trying to figure out whether some peoples home cuddlerooms have midair sex equipment like just 2rich people not 01rich people who can put whole wind pits in their cuddlerooms Maybe a possible method there would be to wear metal bands and put lightning magnets in the ceiling that hovered you by pulling on the metal but I dont know if the math works on that without doing more math

The cloth thing does not at all sound like it would work Cuddlerooms are sex dungeons except named adorably because no one is a sadist

Like the room of your house where you have sex Dungeon sounds sort of like whip but as a spatial place so I dont think dath ilani would have sex wherever that is

Normal peoples houses have one room Rich peoples houses have several rooms but still you have sex in your bedroom usually unless youre into weird things like sex on tables Rich people who like tying people up and hitting them in ways beds do not natively enable might have a sex dungeon I have never heard of a cuddle room and it translates as indulgent in a bizarre direction 

Yeah well if you have an economy that can make more stuff per person they also buy larger houses to contain all that stuff This place were currently staying is larger than my parents house by a factor of 10 but only because they were work focused people who didnt have enough different hobbies that theyd want that many separate rooms My parents could in fact have afforded a house this size though they couldnt have afforded to fill it all up with things wed consider expensive

So yes separate rooms for sex because you own stuff that optimizes sleep and stuff that optimizes sex and they are almost entirely not the same stuff for anything larger scale than a small pillow

I have been trying to figure out where in a bedroom youd have sex because the bedrooms here do not have anything that looks to me like a good surface for having sex on It is now occurring to me that people here probably have sex on the things you call beds and then change the cloth outer surfaces of the bed and then go to sleep there

Yes magicking the sheets rather than changing them but yes Is there some reason not to do that

Its kind of icky from a dath ilani perspective But maybe thats just because we wouldnt have magic for clearing the rooms air afterwards and so on Its just odd to think of doing something that is intrinsically and rightfully messy in the nice clean place where you sleep If this place has spare bedrooms not being used I might ask to have one of those for my cuddleroom Kind of a group resource really under the circumstances

I am sure you can request a cuddle room if you want one Tragically we will not be able to see the confused face of whoever authorizes resources for this project

Magic doesnt do capture of still and moving images

They wont make the face if we might be watching

Chelish version of dignity like being cheerful in a classroom setting

 yeah More centrally this than the cheerfulness in class thing I think Not communicating with your emotions or expressions anything you wouldnt consciously decide to communicate with your words If they wouldnt send you a reply saying sure but I think thats extremely weird of you and they wouldnt then they also wont make a thats extremely weird face where you can see it

There is some really basic thing here about social equilibria which Im missing and under other circumstances Id delay it for later but Im worried that I will somehow do something that Cheliax considers not just undignified but a catastrophic negative indicator if I dont figure it out

Meanwhile in dath ilan there is famous motion capture of like the head Keeper for the entire planet looking surprised on being told experimental results because its way way way beneath her dignity to pretend that shes not surprised when in fact she is surprised

But I mean if everybody here knows that people are faking things as wed see it then its not even a failed attempt at deception because everybody knows whats actually happening so its not even deceptive and there is some very odd equilibrium here that I am not getting at all

I think that if someone was very emotionally expressive in a situation where Chelish people generally dont do emotional communication then we might think they were immature or not fully in control of themselves or trying to make a demand via the emotional expressiveness the way you might do exaggerated emotions to make fun of someone or make a point to a very small child or to make it impossible for people to engage with anything else people are capable of adjusting for other people being from other places though and youre not emotionally expressive to a degree where it has come up already 

But then your Taldane of course does not contain the word for signaling equilibrium I mean I get how its often advantageous to conceal information theres all kinds of Taldane does not contain a word meaning zero sum interaction Theres situations where you do worse if the other person does better like negotiating prices you wouldnt want somebody bargaining with you to know your Taldane doesnt have the word true reserve price The lowest price youd actually accept if its lower than theyd expect for some reason So concealment sure in cases where the other person knows you might be hiding something but what matters is that they dont know exactly what youre hiding But when it comes to uniformly faking false signals I mean if everyone like all the students in the classroom is always wearing a cheerful expression even when theyre not cheerful thats not a Taldane lacks every single component word of the compound term meaning an equilibrium where signals preserve their overt semantics given the incentives for both signal senders and signal receivers Keltham hates this language and hed ask how anybody ever thinks in it but the answer of course is that they dont

If everyone has incentives to fool people by smiling when theyre sad and frowning when theyre happy pretty soon a smile means sadness and a frown means happiness and nobody gets fooled anymore If everybody acts cheerful when theyre not actually cheerful people will figure that out It fooled me but only on literally the first day after I arrived here from another dimension without that custom and this cannot reasonably be the Taldane doesnt have the word average use case Normal way that events happen every day So you have some incredibly weird equilibrium going of a form where everyone is acting cheerful even though they know nobody will actually think they are cheerful Students are behaving in a way wed interpret as being about an adversarial information hiding interaction with their teachers theyre sending a constant first order misleading cheerfulness signal that everybody knows is misleading And I dont understand why or how you got there In dath ilan well before that point a thousand Very Serious People would show up and start arguing that Civilization was doing something silly and needed to wake up and snap out of it

And I know that the answer is probably weird and alien and unLawful by my standards and complicated and is going to take a while to explain and not be particularly sexy so when it comes to that whole general issue we should maybe just pick it up tomorrow Except that theres this one upcoming special case that seems important which is that if I hug you in some way that makes you feel horribly uncomfortable and Chelish dignity calls for you to send a first order misleading constant signal that youre having a great time and Im supposed to already know thats exactly what youd do if something was wrong and then Im meant to act in some complicated way that makes that whole equilibrium not suck for you and that incentivizes people in your position to keep sending the first order misleading signal well in reality I just got here from another plane and I do not in fact have the faintest inkling of do you see why Im trying to ask about this even though we were in the middle of being romantically escalatory

 because youre adorable sorry thats not I do understand what youre saying I think It is not the case that youre supposed to read my signals and assume my acting happy means I am actually sad and need something different I think youre right that this is an extremely complicated conversation thats going to take us half a day in the general case and 

 and there is a person who couldve arrived here instead of Keltham whod run into that problem tonight if say he said I want to sleep with Carissa or Ill go somewhere else with the Lawfulness Revolution and this was obviously worth it to me but not because it was going to be good for me just because I was going to get rich by more than it was going to be bad for me That person would get smiled at and the smile wouldnt be any information actually But but youre going to tell me that a dath ilani even an Evil one wouldnt do that arent you I dont know why they wouldnt do that but you wouldnt do that 

Id tell her that Id trade sexual favors for getting equity in the revolutionary startup if she honestly wanted to make that trade but I wouldnt expect her to ask for a false signal from me and then be fooled by it Like if she handed me a script for scripted sex work Id run her script if she paid me enough but Id expect her to know Or if it came to lying to somebody and telling her that Im attracted to her in hopes that shell give me more equity not that Id expect she would but if that works at all it works because the world is mostly full of people who dont lie about that and those people laid the groundwork for me to fool her successfully so those people built something and Im stomping on it and breaking it and profiting from that and that is something I find genuinely repellent I want to build my own things and profit from them And in this world I dont see how it works at all because if its the expected practice you just know Im probably lying

 okay I have some idea of how I would bridge this but it will take at least an hour and make you very sad But also you might actually prefer to have gotten it all before you try having sex with people here Not because youre going to hurt me if youre just worried that youll hurt me tonight I can just give you my word that Ill tell you in unambiguous words if I need anything but because 

Because her own brain is now screaming with confusion about what the Asmodean version of that is and shes getting ahead of herself trying to figure that out but also its her job which Asmodeus gave her how can she think about anything else 

I cant predict you very well I wish I could I want to understand you as badly as Ive wanted anything in my life But I think I predict that youd want to know first Even if it means we spend the whole night being sad But Im not I dont like giving advice as confused as I am right now 

Keltham leans back into her hoping its the right thing to do A dath ilani in your position asks for time to think gathers her thoughts probably asks more questions to narrow things down about my own state of mind She thinks of questions to ask me privately makes her predictions about how Ill answer and then asks She isnt in a rush to arrive at answers even short term answers about whether or not to give a piece of advice if shes not right in the middle of trying to operate dangerous machinery with a time limit

We dont need to rush on larger timescales either You told me how this subplot ends I can survive if it takes a little longer

 what if she wants to be Lawful Neutral because Keltham is 

Well then shell die and go to Hell and not get to do anything cool so she should pick a less stupid want that isnt based on a crush on a teenager 

It doesnt feel like its because of the crush on the teenager it feels like the other way around

Id like some time to think she says quietly 

Hence the rooftop with the pretty stars Keltham will fall quiet after that

Theyre very pretty stars 

She will die horribly if she turns Keltham against Cheliax Anything thats true of all Golarion isnt that and shes pretty sure that nowhere in Golarion do powerful men want the women theyre sleeping with to communicate needing things to happen differently 

She will die horribly and worse afterwards if she ends up wholly persuaded of Kelthams worldview and not suitable as an instrument of Hell anymore But her first foolish foray into Kelthams worldview was Asmodeus thought worthwhile so maybe she has a bit of slack there presumably he wouldnt have expended those resources for someone who couldnt find the right path even when she was trying And she hasnt gone and asked the cleric her questions yet Maybe its okay to try to understand the dath ilan way of thinking and separately try to understand the Asmodean one and then integrate them If she cant understand dath ilan she wont be able to do her job 

Keltham will at some point figure stuff out not all the stuff but some stuff Hes already figured some things out just from the fact Chelish students conceal distress during class The ideas that look right next to each other to him are different they wont be able to predict which things are right next to other things unless they get really good at dath ilan ness themselves To him people smile during class was right next to you might not actually want to be here not that he has the imagination to have realized the ways she might be here if she didnt want to be

It feels like there are walls closing in from all sides and 

Might someone consult a Keeper she says If they were dath ilani and very stuck and very confused even about the origins of their own confusion

Keltham has likewise been staring up at the stars pondering whether or not he regrets his life choices He thinks not Hes still going to have sex with Carissa later and this way he also got to act cool and all wise in front of her

I was about to say that most dath ilani have options short of paying to talk to a Keeper like they have some regular friends who are older than them and smarter than them Then I remembered you are in fact already one of the smartest people on this planet and also youve been talking to an alien So yeah in dath ilan Governance would make Keeper assistance available to anyone in a position like that and the dath ilani would probably escalate directly to them instead of messing around because theres no point in theres no point in tapping a nail with a tiny hammer when you can hit it with an enormous hammer instead Thats not the original proverb and it doesnt make any sense as he tried to culturally translate it but eh hopefully the idea came across

Okay I think I need to go ask a cleric of Asmodeus for help Theres one on site and I was in fact told to talk to them if I wanted to and I was going to in the morning but I might be sufficiently stuck right now that I ought not to wait

Makes sense If they say something that doesnt make any sense in Lawful terms you could come back and ask me about that and then I could say something else that makes you confused again and you could go back and forth three times and then stop

Or drag them up here and make them talk to you themself while I hide in a corner and listen

That would be cheating And cheating is technique

Maybe the way to straighten everything up is for you to march off directly to Hell and find a door to knock on and invite Asmodeus to debate you Himself Almost definitely heretical Will accept appropriate punishments

Think thats a joke but Im not entirely sure I wouldnt expect to win a debate about any facts where I disagreed with a god Also I thought the running hypothesis was that Asmodeus cant just tell you or even his clerics all the key truths and has no better options than pointing you at an alien who has no idea of the local non necessary facts but who at least has a lock on some universal validities you know I feel a small sense of progress about being able to say that and having it make sense to you where it wouldnt have made sense to you yesterday

Yes sorry that was a joke Asmodeus can only sort of talk to the most powerful devils who can only sort of convey things to the lesser devils who can only sort of convey them to us People do go march into Hell seeking help or advice or something sometimes but this just means bothering people like Contessa Lrilatha theres no Asmodeus to march up to no matter how many doors you knock on I think I understand a lot of things a lot better than yesterday and Im delighted about it but also it means there are all these new confusions in places I was accustomed to relying on

Yeah Im not sure I can say that Ive been there but I suspect that Ive recently been nearby If thats already happening to you then we really need enough Owls Wisdom cleric spells to touch everyone else in the research group once per week or a Wisdom headband to pass around I suspect its a bad idea to let people learn a ton of dath ilani technique and only then hit them with their first Owls Wisdom

Seems like it might be yeah And if you can schedule your heretical realizations then you can also schedule your time with a cleric for right after

I dont think heretical translated at all it sounded like false only actually its some different property a proposition can have than falsity but still a bad one maybe information with negative value flavored Because of course Taldane doesnt have infohazard either also heretical doesnt mean infohazardous or it wouldve translated but if its neither false nor an infohazard then what could possibly make a proposition be a bad one maybe it harms society but not the bearer But that shouldve translated as collective infohazard if the info has local benefit but negative externalities This pathway of communications difficulties may be finite but it sure is a long ass one

Its uh there are a bunch of known ways that human brains misbehave when trying to understand Asmodeanism and if you find yourself convinced of one of them youre supposed to go get it straightened out theyre false but not false like they say different things about how Hell works than normal Asmodeanism does more false like they use a bunch of invalid steps to get to the conclusion which only happens to be correct because society which is using a different reasoning process handed it to them and if they get too attached to their invalid stepping and run off to do further derivations thosell be just straightforwardly false

Particular flavor of invalidity then The word heresy doesnt really sound like that though Well Keltham can just avoid using the word until he actually understands it I create a polite social affordance for you to run off now to the cleric in hopes of getting everything sorted out in time to do something else with your day such as Keltham or to stay and look up at the stars for longer Just say which

I will run off And try not to take too long about it

Dont rush enough that you might end up with the wrong answer Im not a runaway machine thats going to chew through eight houses if you take an extra minute to think

Id offer to stay up here for a set period of time but I dont have my small wearable time telling device Maybe Ill just look up and think for a bit then head on down if I notice myself not wanting to be on the roof

Sounds good Why is he so adorable

And she scurries down the stairs and where is the cleric in charge here going to be in the temple presumably 

That was a very interesting and very confusing conversation and Broom is not quite sure what to make of it He hesitates between continuing to watch Keltham or trying to overhear the womans conversation with an Asmodean cleric 

 Broom is not entirely sure what he can get away with around here just yet Broom is curious about the conversation that will happen with the cleric it is not clear that Broom needs to know in order to do his new job Broom imagines trying to explain to Aspexia Rugatonn why he thought he needed to listen to the conversation with the cleric if he gets caught doing that Broom thinks he would rather not have that conversation Broom shall on reflection continue to watch the human boy who somehow managed to talk himself out of scoring with the older human girl after being told it was a sure thing and who doesnt look particularly regretful about the fact

Is this boy the person who ends the world He doesnt look it but he also seems very very very alien and very hard to understand and might do unexpected things because of that

She slows down from a run before she enters the temple because personally of interest to Asmodeus or not third circle wizards do not go running into His temples like their time is the most important thing around 

Suddenly she is terrified but thats only because shes in line for some correction that is very sorely needed and will help her achieve her goals

Cheliax for all that it is less Lawful than some other very distant realms of existence does not make a habit of missing ploys that are obvious even to Cheliax

Compared to instructions relayed by way of Hell a cleric who receives a direct divine revelation from Asmodeus will have received instruction that is more accurate more precise and much less able to be put into words for other mortals to hear The project to extract extraplanar knowledge from Keltham was established based in part upon a vision from Asmodeus The priest who received the vision from Asmodeus reported his best guess that there was a sense that Asmodeus thought their visitor was potentially valuable and not just being given unexplained protections What else was in the message from Asmodeus Was there anything else important not yet done This tends to be very hard for recipients of visions to convey if it is not blindingly obvious

The priest in question also headed up a Worldwound installation was fifth circle and had proven himself on lesser commands Placing him in command of the villa project was another obvious bet

Ferrer Maillol himself fifth circle cleric of Asmodeus is not currently enjoying himself quite so much as when he was fighting an endless horde of demons at the Worldwound The Worldwound did not have alien teenagers being insane direct orders from Hell that are incredibly inexplicable random wizard students getting oracled by Nethys and way too many complications he is not allowed to set on fire until they shape up Ferrer Maillol had not until just today appreciated the degree to which it is easier to fight an endless horde of demons compared to sending out a new top priority message to Aspexia Rugatonn every hour He had quietly resolved to himself that he was very seriously going to consider whether the next such message should be batched in part to conserve his remaining supply of communication spells and in part because he was worried about how Aspexia Rugatonn was going to take his hourly interruptions

Of course the next piece of news he got was about a fucking Otolmens event

When Ferrer Maillol is notified that Carissa Sevar wants to see the head priest there is only one first thought which goes through his mind which is not again

Ferrer Maillol instructs that Carissa Sevar is to be shown to him at once and fixes a very bland expression on his face

What is it

I understand it to be the will of Asmodeus that I get a better theological education as if I were the inheriting daughter of a Count I have just spent an evening with Keltham in which he kept asking questions that were extremely difficult to answer from within my present understanding of Asmodean theology which I know to be deficient He wants me to figure out my internal confusions promptly because he might not want to have sex with internally confused people and suggested I seek you out now

Which is important because it means that this will all have to be very time bounded and Kelthams expecting her back except he wouldnt be that surprised really if straightening herself out took longer than expected but it still wouldnt be ideal 

Carissa needs to be smarter and not for the first time in the last three hours is really terrified she will not live to acquire the headband thatll do it

At least Sevar doesnt have any more brilliant ideas such as her last one which was that Ferrer Maillols life wasnt going to be complicated enough unless he added an additional number of teenage girls to it

Prioritized for theological instruction as if you were a fourth circle cleric Maillol corrects sharply and then pauses to reflect on whether he has violated Aspexia Rugatonns instructions for the gentle handling of Carissa Sevar no shes seeking this of her own accord actually he should check that if shes having trouble remembering Hells instructions Would you say you are not seeking this instruction of your own accord Keltham is not a member of the Church but him suggesting you into it is ambiguous Maillol is unsure what he should make of Hells instructions in that case He really does not want to bother Aspexia Rugatonn about it already

Keltham advised only that I use dath ilani techniques for thinking about confusing things I realized that I needed someone who understands the thing Asmodeus communicated to me that I dont understand and I told him I should talk to a cleric

That is good behavior Ferrer Maillol gives her his least frightening smile the smile that Asmodean priests give to the lesser people who do something Church approved You may be unfortunately optimistic if you think that I will be able to entirely clarify Hells message Still if you were given this affordance it suggests that Asmodeus thinks some benefit may come of it Seek instruction then if it is of your own accord and I will assist you as our Lord commanded us

 nod

She is going to sound like an idiot Shes just going to ignore that and try anyway if her idiocy is revealed then it can be corrected 

I think dath ilani people genuinely understand Law better than us I think theyre mostly Lawful Good and Keltham is Lawful Neutral but their understanding of Law is correct in important ways we werent going to derive ourselves and so there is a Lawful Evil version of it And in class I was trying to come up with it And then I got the communication she pulls out the scroll Aspexia Rugatonn gave her reads it off so she cant be misremembering Remember that you are not Irori Do not think yourself likely to succeed in perfecting yourself without divine aid

Acknowledge the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis and accept that your rightful place is in Hell

And I think what was being very generously communicated by mentioning Irori and Axis was that I was borrowing too much from Keltham who is Lawful Neutral and that I dont truly understand the nature of Evil and so the thing I was building wouldnt have been of any value it wouldve been missing something Asmodeus wants But presumably I am capable of learning it or hed just have let me get it wrong and accidentally make myself worthless Do you have any idea what it might be

Ferrer Maillols first thought is the obvious one that he hopes this new brilliant idea of Sevars works out better for him than her one about providing Keltham with lots of girls one of whom gets oracled by Nethys though of course that wasnt her decision and the Church of Asmodeus is not confused about who bears the real responsibility

His second thought is about a distinction he was warned about that theyve been instructed to prioritize Sevar as if she were Asmodeuss own fourth circle cleric not to answer as if she were one It rules out the obvious answer hed give to a fourth circle Asmodean cleric standing nearby and asking what Sevar was missing Still Asmodeuss language to Sevar if it wasnt just poorly translated by Hell suggests that Sevar has the kind of soul that Asmodeus actually wants if He can win it in this contest with Irori or whatever is actually going on here He is not to try to guess and be helpful in a way that pushes the edges of Hells orders the Grand High Priestess was quite clear on that

He will then answer as he might answer somebody who was considered to have enough potential that Asmodeus might choose them to be a cleric perhaps though not yet chosen or as he might answer a promising heiress of Chelish nobility

People in Cheliax register as Lawful and as Evil and worship no Lawful Evil god other than Asmodeus or his subordinates This suffices for much of Asmodeuss purpose as it brings those souls to Hells standard gate which Asmodeus has already conquered and so into His ownership for further refinement We do not ask most people to understand what Lawful Evil really is let alone what would distinguish Asmodeus from Zon Kuthon within Lawful Evil Most people do not in fact need to understand this They do not possess the nature that marks them as potentially one of Asmodeuss own instead of just the masses who must be coerced to Lawfulness out of fear and who end up registering as Evil because that is what the rules make of conducting yourself in ways not completely absurd

You Sevar might have the potential to become one of Asmodeuss own not just Lawful and Evil Or so our Lords instructions to you suggest You are I think being invited to join the inner circle And I am not expecting you to already understand what that truly means because it is not something we bother trying to teach most third circle wizards So the question I am about to ask is not a test of loyalty but a test for whether you belong in the beginner classroom or the advanced one What have you already grasped if anything of the difference between Lawful Evil and Asmodeanism What makes Cheliax an Asmodean country and not just a Lawful Evil one

AAH 

 which is completely unreasonable because this is about as gentle an introduction as she could possibly have hoped for 

She has never considered the question before but she is a day of dath ilan better at thinking than anyone else in Cheliax and would like to show it ideally The part of that which sounds easiest is the difference between Asmodeus and Zon Kuthon she says Zon Kuthon intrinsically values suffering more I think If everyone in the universe were uh constantly being creatively tortured Zon Kuthon would be entirely pleased by that And Hell ruled by Asmodeus isnt like that thered lots of torture but there is the opportunity to not be tortured the opportunity to be such a high performer that you are satisfactory the opportunity to be doing the torturing the opportunity to be deciding who is tortured Asmodeus wants some features of Hell other than the suffering I mean in addition to the suffering I know the sufferings important these are guesses maybe Asmodeus values people having the experience of their suffering being related to qualities they have knowing you are suffering because of your own conduct and choices not just at unlucky random maybe Asmodeus values people striving to avoid further torture or some of the things they do while theyre trying to avoid further torture or uh them becoming more like him in becoming more the kind of entity whod run Hell the way he runs it maybe he values people being rewarded when theyve earned it maybe he values earning it feels like a natural category here if I had to guess I would guess that Asmodeus values people earning features of their situation through their actions or their fundamental nature uh the strongest counterargument I can think of to that is that its too Lawful Neutral again to each their just rewards is not right as a description of Asmodeus But there are other ways for there to be a relationship between your actions and what happens to you

Satisfactory for someone who was never taught Beginners classroom but a thinking beginner

The primary domains of Asmodeus are tyranny slavery compacts and pride Tyranny is not just rulership Slavery is not just obedience Compacts are not just deals Pride is not just having a high opinion of yourself

For Zon Kuthon the object of torture is torture For Asmodeus the object of torture is not only the benefit Asmodeus gains when people obey The object of torture is that Cheliax be a tyranny not just a farm from which Asmodeus extracts a maximum yield of wheat Tyranny as Asmodeus sees it requires tyrants not just a single decider at the top but deciders all through the system who enforce obedience with whip and pain He is a Lawful Evil god the tyrants are there to enforce rules and not just to do as they please they are subject to rules themselves

We are taught we Asmodeuss own clerics not the common people that Asmodeus holds the key of Rovagugs prison fitting a lock that Abadar made so that Asmodeus alone could open it Why Asmodeus Because Asmodeus alone can be trusted by Pharasma that even after He conquers every plane and every part of reality Asmodeus will never seek to displace Pharasma Herself Pharasma is the one who made the rules that send people to the Hell that Asmodeus governs Because Pharasma exists Asmodeus is just enforcing the rules that She made when He tortures a soul in Hell He is being Lawful Evil and not just Evil He is being tyrannical and not just sadistic Asmodeus is the one god who cannot exist as Himself without a Pharasma above Him to set Him in place and define the system He enforces and that was why He alone is entrusted to hold Rovagugs key He too is only following His orders each time He receives a new soul into Hells embrace

The language we are speaking is ill suited to such distinctions because mortals are ill suited to understanding them and you should not read too much into how we mortals flail for one mortal concept or another To Asmodeus to a greater devil the shape of the meaning is precise There are many souls in Cheliax who would rather hold the whip themselves than be the one whipped That does not make them Asmodean it makes them selfish There are many souls in Cheliax who would enjoy holding the whip because they are sadists because they delight in causing others pain and crushing them below That doesnt make them Asmodeuss rather than Zon Kuthons But some souls in Cheliax enjoy holding the whip more when they are doing it to enforce the rules you might even say that they need there to be rules and need there to be some higher tyrant above them so that they are being more than just sadists If those souls have enough potential to be worth empowering Asmodeus chooses them for His own to be His cleric and grants to them His domain of tyranny

To delight in tyranny is not mandatory to be one of Asmodeuss own The devil you met this day may have had no joy in tyranny for all we know he was not a devil who had other devils beneath him But when he was mortal he must have already delighted in the compacts that Asmodeus delights in by which the wheels of Law turn to crush one party or another to the contract beneath them He was not just Lawful and Evil but delighted in Law turned to the purposes of Evil And because of that after his death and through his suffering he was elevated and raised to the status of a greater devil and kept that part of himself which was pleasing to Asmodeus As he was one of us in his mortal life so he is now part of the inner ring in Hell

Tyranny not just rulership Slavery not just obedience Compacts not just deals Pride not just self value Maybe all of those will appeal to you maybe only one but you must have great potential for at least one if I am not entirely mistaken about the meaning of Hells translated will of Asmodeus conveyed to you

It feels so far from something she could translate for Keltham but all true things can be said in the same language so there is a way there is a version of this written in dath ilans style of thought which she can understand and embody Should it be obvious to me which one just by thinking about it

Perhaps not I doubt that Asmodeus would have bothered to instruct you to seek out those elements of your own soul or for us to assist you if it was a ten minute job

Competent natural tyrants are the most useful members of the inner circle and we try to give every intelligent Chelish citizen a chance to enforce some rules with a whip to let them discover that tendency if they have it If you rise high within this world you will discover very rapidly that the number of competent Asmodean managers you can find to help run your operations is an extreme check on your ambitions It is plausibly the limiting factor for the entire Chelish state Slavemasters and lawyers are not nearly so much in demand Pride tends to be expensive in multiple ways and not just financially so it is largely the domain of nobles or the very wealthy who by their own nature cannot be too numerous relative to the general population Outside of tyranny then you may lack firsthand experience with other elements of Asmodeuss domain as experienced by the insiders

Do you wish to hear my guess about your Asmodean potentials It seems to me that there is a tension between Asmodeuss instructions to me that we are to assist you if you seek instruction and Asmodeuss instructions to you that you are to find that part of yourself My own resolution of the tension would be that I should answer if you ask because I am to concern myself with Asmodeuss instructions to myself which say that I am to assist you and not with weighing Asmodeuss instructions to you

I do want to hear your guess I think I would benefit from knowing where to look even if I am meant to find it on my own

Pride and slavery You asked to be prettier as the first element of your shopping list The part of Hell which your attention naturally focused upon was the slavery there the precise structures of pain and obedience

What is pride if its not just what had he said not just a high opinion of yourself Does she have a high opinion of hers yes yes she does

Pride is the aspect of Asmodeus that Ferrer Maillol understands the least well himself Which is unfortunate for him because the greater devils all seem to possess pride in abundance and its a good guess that having that much feeling about yourself and your place for Hells tortures to perfect into precisely Asmodean pride is part of what helps you stay yourself through Hell The way in which hereditary nobles seem to end up as higher devils after their death despite what Ferrer Maillol would privately term some severe deficits of other competence would seem to bear this out unless its just the sort of unfairness in which the Tyrant so delights

He answers then from textbook and catechism It is obviously a god concept and not one which mortal concepts are very apt to describe It may help to remember that this is a Lawful Evil domain and many things that mortals think of with the usual word pride are neither Lawful nor Evil to say nothing of Law that does Evil or Evil that upholds Law The Lawful aspect of Asmodean pride is that it is bound up with having a place within Asmodeuss tyranny and which that tyranny has assigned to you The Evil aspect of it is that it is yours and you defend it and you will crush others to defend it By doing this you enforce the structures of the tyranny and keep others in their place below you it is Evil turned to the purposes of Law One seeks to climb the ranks of the tyranny but within the tyranny and by this the strong rise and the tyranny itself is strengthened

Those with deep Asmodean senses of pride have a felt sense of the order of the universe itself being disrupted when somebody fails to give them their due or when people weaker than themselves seem to be raised above them They are not simply defending themselves from insult or seizing an opportunity to take somebody elses position They are restoring the order of the tyranny itself in face of the disorder that is a weak unworthy person occupying a position of power or esteem

Do you just want to be prettier Carissa Or do you have a sense that there is an order within the universe that is offended if people weaker than you less deserving than you get to be pretty and you dont

Thinking that people ought to look at you and see how much you matter that you matter more than them Is that the right sort of thing 

Yes Though do not omit the idea of grandeur Ferrer Maillol taps the robes he is wearing of a fifth circle cleric of Asmodeus magical cloth of the highest quality with gold and with rubies These vestments do not simply inform others of my place They are grand expensive rare enviable difficult for others to obtain They embody what it means for me to have risen high in Cheliax they do not simply inform others of the fact Do you just want people to know the truth that you matter more than them Or do you want to walk into a ballroom full of higher nobility and watch the fearful ones slink away from you and the ambitious ones flock to court you and the ignorant wonder who you are to matter so much more than themselves Do you just want others to know youre important or hammer the existence of Carissa Sevar into your lessers like striking them down with a mace

Carissa really really really wants to know how Keltham would answer that question I want that she says instead dragging her thoughts away from Keltham and to imagining it I want people to be jealous of me and to aspire to be me and to despair at how theyre not good enough to be me

Not of itself sufficient for our inner circle But I doubt given Asmodeuss instructions that He expected you to learn your place in Hell and join His most treasured possessions with only a moments thought and a word of advice My duty to Asmodeus also bids me warn you pride is the domain of Asmodeus where I hold the least expertise If a fourth circle cleric had questions I could not answer there while about Asmodeuss business they might need to wait upon a visit from a higher circle cleric to answer in my place

That Ferrer is so quick to think of his duty to Asmodeus there may reflect his own lack of pride though how that is a failure to enforce his own place within the tyranny or its laws is lost on him It doesnt seem exactly the thing that a devil in his position would do though the devils wouldnt ignore their duty to Asmodeus either They would disclaim their own lack of expertise with more grandeur somehow and Ferrer Maillol is aware that in reality most of his grandeur comes from his vestments and his ability to kill people who annoy him

Does he not want people to envy him Or just have enough of the thing thats not sufficient as 

Okay I think I can productively work on that one alone though I would be grateful for advice if you have it shes going to have to be so proactive about seeking out their help given the rule they cant just tell her when she obviously needs it And maybe on slavery What are the signs of having potential at that one

You are obviously interested in it and I doubt you are interested in it for purposes of stamping it out like a paladin of Iomedae You skipped right over the question of how we raise mortal slaves in Cheliax and went straight to the more interesting tortures in Hell wondering exactly how they were designed to suit which purposes of Asmodeus Ferrer Maillol gives her now the sort of conspiratorial smile that hed give to an up and coming new member of the Inner Ring an entire aspect of Asmodean theology whose details Sevar has not yet inquired into and which she probably isnt ready for I havent any trouble imagining you a thousand years hence as a Baron of Hell overseeing the refinement of thousands of fresh mortals or maybe even a Duke of Hell set to raise the highest of future devils from the most promising candidates

Though you will be more immediately useful to our Lord if you can train valuable slaves for Him here keeping in mind that we are all our Lords slaves Dont only think of collared wretches dredging the streets if training them for sale doesnt seem grand enough to suit you Do you find yourself inspired to teach a new generation of wizards perhaps And if so would you rather teach them in Lastwall under whatever absurd restrictions hold there Or in Cheliax where you are free to punish and reward as you please where mortals are your raw material to be freely crafted so long as you deliver results

I want I want to figure out what dath ilan but Asmodean is and I want to prove that it makes better wizards and better soldiers and better devils eventually

Ferrer Maillol chuckles in a way that is only 95 humorless for infinity percent more humor than he uses on most occasions Sevar there are certainly a thousand subtle refinements of the notion of Asmodean slavery beyond that but dont overlook that if you set out to produce better wizards soldiers and devils by any useful means and without a hundred mad restrictions preventing you from doing it properly paladins of Iomedae will call you a slaver and try to stop you If our Lord demanded that people comprehend the exact full meaning of His domains before He would choose a cleric of the first circle He would have no clerics in this world

Im not tempted by Good she says which is more candid than shes ever even contemplated being with a superior but if she needs correcting she needs correcting shes not trying to avoid that at this point Good is stupid and if you try to do anything ambitious itll be Evil I know that I acknowledge myself to being susceptible to ending up Neutral accidentally but its not squeamishness or thinking that its important people have a nice time while theyre learning things its modeling Keltham too closely probably My job right now is half trying to understand Keltham and half not to be a heretic while Im doing it I am sure Im pointed in the wrong direction somewhere but Im not pointed in thinking children should decide whether they go to school or spend all day lounging around eating sweets and I know were all children

If it seems stupidly obvious to you that slavery is the way to go Sevar that is not unsuggestive of an aptitude for it Hells relayed instructions seem to me to suggest that you are in danger of heresy primarily because you have not found within yourself the desires that would keep you out of Axis

Ferrer Maillol taps his fingers on his thigh so that Sevar knows hes thinking and doesnt try to interrupt him There were some interesting points in Sevars file drawn from her mind being read He wouldnt ordinarily say this part it has been sometimes known to confuse even first circle clerics but Sevar may need to know Theres a story not commonly told to Asmodean clerics before they reach second circle except in special cases but you may possibly be one of those cases After I tell it to you you are not to repeat it to anyone not at least a second circle cleric of Asmodeus including high nobility of Cheliax Security will know better than to repeat it if they read it from your thoughts and it is already the case that nobody is allowed to read your mind unless they are at clearance levels far above the ones you used to have Clear

 yes

There was once a well hushed scandal concerning a certain ordinary Baroness who was found to have been keeping as a bed slave a man whod been chosen as a first circle cleric of Asmodeus She kept him after his choosing Tell me what do you suppose happened after that

 I assume if the answer were she was punished because thats presumably illegal then you wouldnt be telling me this as an important story Was she promoted So the arrangement wasnt a problem

Illegal doesnt begin to cover it There was an immediate massive clampdown on the entire event as fast as word could be passed upward as people saw the potential for conflict between Church and Queen over the details of how to handle it The Baroness in question who was in my own personal opinion something of an absolute idiot seemed to feel that shed done nothing wrong since the cleric himself had never said that Asmodeus didnt want her to go on keeping him

An ensuing investigation turned up the puzzling fact that this new cleric had no visible aptitude for tyrannizing others nor for crafting slaves nor for executing compacts and he definitely had no visible pride This of course made our Lords mysterious action all the more potentially important to understand if it was not done for any of the usual reasons

The answer in the end was that the man had no aptitude for tyrannizing others but that he felt on a truly deep level that it was right for him to be tyrannized He had no aptitude as a slavemaster but felt that it was very right and proper for him to be a slave He had no aptitude for contracts but felt that all was right with the world when his Baroness was forcing him into grossly unfair bargains in her bed games He understood the order of society that underlies pride and saw his own place was at the bottom of it This we think is why Asmodeus chose him though Asmodeus made no revelations on that subject

It is not just a lie told to the masses if you were ever wondering about that that Asmodeus has been known to treasure some of His possessions as things beautiful to Him in themselves and not just for the uses that we have to Him So far as we know the man was not being very useful to Asmodeus before or after he became His cleric He had simply earned Asmodeuss favor by having a rare nature pleasing to His sight

The bed slave cleric was purchased for a high price resold to a more trustworthy noble at a vastly higher price and afterwards the Baroness in question seems to have been assassinated by no known party The entire matter stays swept firmly into the corners because if it became known idiots would derive the wrong lesson about what nobles are allowed to do to our Lords clerics

I mention this in case any of your own desires lie in the opposite polarity from the vantage point that nobles usually take It also shows that Asmodeuss domains can be subtle things even in their largest directions You would not know all about them from hearing the four concepts listed out There should be desires in you that are pleasing to our Lord and will prevent you from falling into heresy You should not cast too narrow an eye when it comes to looking for those desires I suggest Asmodeus would not have given such weighty instructions if the matter was going to be simple

It is in particular obvious to him that Sevar may perhaps have the nature of a slave rather than a slaver given some of the thoughts recorded in her file Ferrer Maillol is not certain he should spell this out directly

 is it a problem if I let Keltham hit me I havent but should it come up 

Oh there are quite a number of clerics and loyal nobles like that in the hidden behind the scenes of Cheliax Though that nature is not by itself sufficient for full admission

I would expect so because theres not that much of a gender discrepancy in the hierarchy and there is in liking sorry never mind Ill keep that in mind I obviously everyone is supposed to be grateful to be the possession of Asmodeus and I dont know how to tell if one is more grateful than average

If you have even once in your life sincerely thought that you wished to burn in the purifying flames of Hell and emerge perfected I think you are a step ahead of the general peasantry Ferrer Maillol says dryly I am not looking forwards to it in fact though I would not say as much to anyone who didnt have a note in their file about having apparently sincerely thought what you did

At our level in our inner fellowship it is not demanded of us that we pretend that the fates Pharasma assigned us are the fates we would have chosen for ourselves We live inside an absolute and inescapable greater tyranny all of us from Cheliax to Lastwall from slaves to the gods of Good Most people have no natural response to that except for endless whining and complaining and living in denial until Lawful Evil inevitably conquers everything that isnt Lawful Evil Some of us are born with something that is native to the plane we live in that can push along the tyranny rather than being swept away struggling Thats why we get to wear pretty rubies on our robes and burn in Hell for a shorter time and come out of it as higher devils

Were not just playing the game because we want a better score in it Its our game Wed play it even if Asmodeus wasnt there

Its that quality not feeling grateful for Asmodeus having to force us into it that makes us the favored of Asmodeus and recognized as His own

Though thats all Inner Ring theology and part of his own favored concern of tyranny which he should maybe not emphasize as much if Sevar hasnt a visible aptitude for it

She indeed is slightly confused by that may I take notes

Ill get you a secure notebook Bide He opens the door of his office and takes a few rapid strides until he finds someone who can be ordered to get an unbound secure notebook from the military inventory

Carissa is trying to commit all that to memory so she can think about it in more detail later Most people dont want to burn in the purifying flames of Hell what does that mean They would prefer it if they didnt in fact need much purifying Sure Carissa would prefer that too thatd be awfully convenient though shed trade more purifying for coming out better on the other end would most people not take that trade Are most clerics of Asmodeus not able to notice that it is good to suffer if you come out of the suffering improved But its very obvious She thinks she could even phrase it so Keltham agreed We are all slaves of this world the way Pharasma made it seems true presumably not heretical to think of Pharasma as having made it but also we would make it ourselves but would we Maybe we would make dath ilan instead 

Ferrer Maillol waits on the notebook it takes longer than it would have before with the Forbiddance up Apparently some fool failed to immediately issue Sevar with a secure notebook after she was made privy to secrets After this he should probably check in on the military side and see what kind of mess theyve made of Sevars status inside the system

We live inside an absolute and unescapable greater tyranny Seems true Some of us can be more than grist for it Seems true Most people who are devout servants of Asmodeus are not grateful to belong to Asmodeus but they are 

 but they are like Asmodeus Thats a frame that fits Asmodeus wants people who are like him and people whod build Hell rather than dath ilan are more like Asmodeus And Carissa is going to have to well either shes going to have to shape up at that or shes going to have to demonstrate that a Lawful Evil dath ilan is just better

Ferrer Maillol returns and hands Carissa her new secure notebook along with a pamphlet on the regulations for secure notebooks which he forgot to ask for and which some abnormally competent officer had delivered to him anyways Do you require further theological instruction Have you resolved whatever issue with Keltham first brought you here You have not asked much explicitly about that whatever it was a matter lying entirely within your own discretion but I am checking that it is your discretion

No I do want help on that too Keltham noticed that no one in Cheliax indicates how they feel during classes by looking distressed and inferred from this that no one would indicate how they felt during sex by looking distressed and that bothered him on some kind of principle that so I think it did not in fact occur to him that one could simply not really care if people are secretly distressed he instead concluded that weve got some extremely clever way to notice secret distress despite everyone hiding it and was worried that not knowing this himself hed fail to notice I was distressed if I was and I swear I didnt give him any reason to think I would be hes just like this And the problem with trying to lie to him is that which facts about the world are inferrable from which other ones is completely sideways for him Im genuinely worried that if Id just said oh normally people are really good at reading lip twitches but Ill just tell you then something else wouldve gone horribly wrong because he made a bunch of inferences from our presumed use of lip twitches he was really confused about the fact people dont look distressed at each other on purpose he felt like it was broken a norm that shouldnt be able to persist in existing And I have no idea what Im allowed to tell him about anything and Id rather as much as possible tell him the truth because of the sideways inferences problem but I havent gotten any guidance on which things specifically I should lie about besides Hell and Im separately worried that if I just sleep with him which Id really really like to and then later explain the thing where some people solve the inference problem by simply not caring how the other party is doing then hell be he wont endorse having slept with me without knowing that 

Thats the thing I was stuck on what to tell him that only relies on facts about human nature that are true in other countries too and not on anything about Cheliax

Ferrer Maillol may need to go get his own notebook for this one He taps his fingers again to show that hes thinking

Im afraid Ferrer Maillol says not bothering to keep the dryness out of his voice that after hearing your analysis of Keltham I have some absolutely terrible news for you about my opinion of your competence to handle this issue

I know Ive in over my head If you think you have someone who can impersonate me and do better Ill obviously assist them however I can Or get me a headband which is what I asked for in the first place

Oh its much worse than that Sevar My opinion is that even after reading the transcripts of everything Keltham said in his lessons I have no fucking idea what youre talking about If you understand what the fuck you just said to me then you are in fact the most qualified person inside this villa to make the call as to what to tell Keltham and when Unless theres some better analysis from the security officers whove been monitoring him but maybe not paying quite as much attention to learning from the man Which means that we are going to go off right now and have that conversation with the security officers the one where you get authorized to make that call If you fuck up itll be your head on the chopping block followed immediately after by mine for choosing you And since I do value my head Ill get you your fucking intelligence headband

Oh

Great

If theres an Asmodean subdomain for obsession with intelligence headband obtainment verging on suicidal lemminghood Sevar is truly His prophet already Ferrer Maillol keeps this observation to himself

He stands up Follow me Sevar and well have that conversation Asmodeus help us all

All Carissas slaves are going to get intelligence headbands It will make them more useful 

She follows

Security for an operation like this is typically within an extradimensional space so they cant be affected by spells targetting the installation the Forbiddance makes that impossible so theyre doing their best with having draped a parlor in lead which blocks most spells and having a miserable captive air elemental providing ventilation Theres one bed since even though theres ten of them they only need two hour sleep shifts 

Rodez Balaguerre is on duty handling emergency requests right now He looks tired

Ferrer Maillol doesnt even slightly care Call in whichever wizard or wizards would be most likely able to handle a question about Kelthams psychology and our strategy for what to reveal to him when

The fact that Maillol doesnt already know who that is that there isnt someone already known to be in charge of decisions like that with individual judgments instead being rendered by individual Security officers is a very bad sign now that Maillol thinks on it explicitly That needs to end now one way or another

Thats Elias Abarco who shows up a couple of minutes later He looks tired too 

Ferrer Maillol doesnt care about that either since Elias Abarco hasnt yet been added to the worryingly rapidly expanding list of people that hes no longer allowed to set on fire Abarco Theres a judgment call about what to reveal to Keltham and which lies to tell him Sevar Ask Abarco what you asked me

Deep breath 

Shes going to try to explain it better this time in case maybe Maillol would understand it if she explained better 

Keltham noticed that no one indicates how they feel during classes by looking distressed when they dont understand whats going on That is not what happens in dath ilan He inferred from this that no one would indicate how they felt during sex by looking distressed if they did not like what was being done to them He automatically assumed that we wouldnt want that and concluded instead that we must have some more complicated way of communicating that information I was uncertain whether to make one up or to try to explain to him that normally people just dont worry very much if their sex partners are invisibly distressed The problem with trying to lie to him is that which facts about the world are inferrable from which other ones is completely sideways for him and I dont think I could accurately track all the inferences hed make from something I made up 

Id rather as much as possible tell him the truth because of the sideways inferences problem but I need guidance on which things its most important to keep secret even at some cost in our overall plausibility and coherence as he experiences it And I need to solve this right away because I think if I just sleep with him and then later explain the thing where some people solve the inference problem by simply not caring how the other party is doing he wont endorse having slept with me without knowing that

The problem Abarco says to Maillol is that Keltham is insane and predicting how hell take anything is as she points out next to impossible The librarys not filtered for pretending rape doesnt exist 

Ive told him that rape exists He knows that He just thinks that since I have assented to be there in the first place were executing a procedure where I should also be having a nice time the whole time and itd be a problem if he failed to notice a Chelish signal that I wasnt

 shes describing him mostly accurately as far as I can tell Abarco says

Maillol raises his eyebrows not approvingly Hell doesnt refer to someone as a teacher if theyre just insane Do you have an analysis for me Abarco Do you have a strategy for handling this

I think theres no point in trying to conceal anything on this plane except the internal workings of the Church and government from Keltham hell expect those to be concealed dath ilan keeps its secrets I think we dont have the resources to convince him that Cheliax is the kind of place in which he wont encounter adversarial conduct we just dont know how to pretend at that and its already too late so we mostly just want him thinking that this place needs lots of fixing up which he currently believes Sevar can explain how sex works to him though she should mind her tendency towards female victimization flavored heresies

Hey no no hes right she should mind that

Elias Abarco has brought up additional points that Sevar didnt bring up which complicates this already painful decision And Abarco didnt bring up the critical point about only telling Keltham the sad little facts that are true in other countries not just in Cheliax which means he wouldnt have done well leaving the whole decision to Abarco

Ferrer Maillol would if he were alone massage his forehead

The Asmodean style of tyranny is not about spreading around responsibility so nobody seems to be at fault for making bad decisions Those are weak tyrannies There must be a single decision maker on point as is both efficient and Asmodean That designated person must be Abarco Sevar or Maillol himself and any of those three people screwing up gets Maillol equally blamed for it which leaves the pure and simple question of which of the three is least likely to fuck up Maillol is pretty sure thats not himself which brings it down to two

In the end what decides him is simply that Abarco called Keltham insane Its not a judgment conducive to making the kind of detailed predictions necessary for the actual moment to moment decisions

Asmodeus help you and me Sevar Im making it your call Your goal directives are as follows prioritize the amount of time we get before this falls down and Keltham breaks with us Secondary priority if possible try to make Keltham think that he should take you or some other loyal woman with him if he leaves us Do not bother worrying about Kelthams opinion of Cheliax after the whole thing blows up He wont be happy ship sailed Just make sure we get as much as we can from him before then

Abarco Advise Sevar well on this and all related matters and report to me if you think shes fucking it up If this project fails early and it looks like it was even slightly your fault for sabotaging her I will make damned sure you die before I do

Balaguerre Sevar gets transcripts of Kelthams words and his thoughts on remaining occasions where we make the call to risk reading his thoughts Sevar gets consulted on Keltham analysis and policy if theres time Sevar takes initiative on answering him if shes inside the room Sevar gets reports on any other decisions that get made without her about what to tell him and why

And give Sevar her fucking intelligence headband if we have a spare on hand If we dont give her a Foxs Cunning so she has something to work with for a few minutes while trying to make the call on Keltham Then message at the next regular report that I want an intelligence headband delivered soonest and if its not here inside twenty four hours then I will go looking for it and nobody wants to be there when I come looking Maillol wishes he could just grab an intelligence headband from any of these fucking wizards wholl make less important use of it but that is escalating way beyond just setting somebody on fire for a few hours or at least wizards act that way

This is an important responsibility and she should not look all smug about it or maybe she should because thats exercising the vice of pride which she is naturally inclined towards She should look mildly smug about it 

There is not a spare headband on site There has been something of a run on Cheliaxs spare headband supply what with the dozen emergencies so far today It shouldnt be a problem to get one in six hours A transcript of Kelthams words so far is available for her to review now

Get her a Ring of Sustenance as well Maillol orders Itll take a week before they can get any extra hours of work out of Sevar that way and Asmodeus knows if this project will still exist or if the combined weight of divine interventions on it will have collapsed Golarion but if the project does still exist he expects Sevar will have quite the lovely backlog of tasks by then Stores if we have one otherwise add it to the requisition

We have those He hands one over

Keltham also wants a headband and ones for his other girls and ones with Owls Wisdom as well I dont think Ill be able to keep up with him if hes got a headband as good as mine hes not smarter but hes got more of a force multiplier They could give her intrinsic intelligence boosts with Wish and then the headband on top of that but she is pretty sure at some point if she keeps pushing for intelligence enhancement shes going to reach the edge of their deeply bizarre commitment to not lighting her on fire I think I could tell him that theyve been commissioned and will arrive in a week or two and that we can have one to pass around in the meantime if we can in fact have one to pass around in the meantime

Maillol isnt even slightly fooled by her hidden agenda but its not a hidden agenda which is detrimental to him so its not like he disapproves Sevar I dont care what Keltham wants I care how much we get out of him You dont just tell me what he asked for any more you tell me what happens if I say yes Whats your estimated effect on him if we supply him with one lesser intelligence headband and one lesser Wisdom headband to pass around And if you think thats a good idea or bad idea for other reasons dont make me ask you for your opinion Youre in the command structure now Grow up Grow up very quickly

I think supplying him with a headband probably means he sees through us faster but not supplying him with a headband looks increasingly suspicious or incompetent I expect the lectures will be higher quality if he has enhancement and more useful to the students if they do until it falls apart which will probably be sooner Though his god can give him Wisdom himself so we cant make plans that rely on his not having it and the costs of him having more of it are probably small a fourth circle cleric could have an hour a day anyway if his god decides to indicate he ought to spend the day reflecting by giving him nothing but actually what do we know about what its Abadar right wants here 

We know almost nothing specifically As a matter of general theology Abadar probably approves of the project even more than Asmodeus does and wants Kelthams knowledge to spread beyond Cheliax eventually but doesnt feel strongly about whether Cheliax pulls ahead of Osirion for a while His not giving Keltham any particular visions seems suggestive of a bargain with our Lord possibly and if so Abadar wont try to wriggle around inside whatever bargain Hes struck with Asmodeus until Asmodeus wriggles first which our own Lord will probably do eventually Some of the spells we already know Keltham got from his open prayer are suggestive of Abadar not approving of the deception were running on him which is also theologically to be expected

A fact you may not know Sevar earlier thought reading on Keltham showed him to be suspicious of externally supplied mind affecting spells It will be in your transcripts Maybe we can play to that find Keltham a book on the subject which mentions cursed forms of the item or which claims that theres a higher tier version of Foxs Cunning that you can use to make the recipient think theyre smarter about particular subjects while actually not doing that Weve got a Wondrous Items enchanter working on a rush project to create tools so we can do edits to books more easily and meanwhile we can get a forger printer to stamp out individual alternate pages to splice in Our wonderful new pet Nethys worshipper does give us a way to send Keltham exactly the books we want him to have and it explains why were not just shipping him a dozen different ones

If that ploy fails or if you think its a bad idea to try and Keltham does start wanting to wear his own headband getting you a higher tier intelligence headband is not something I can do in a day Sevar But your request and the reason for it has been noted

By tomorrow youll also need to devise an explanation to Keltham for why you got your own private headband weeks ahead of the other women if you want to wear it around him If its not a good enough explanation youll need to take it off around him Do not give me any wizard shit about that Maillol has very little sympathy for why wizards are under the impression that matters of intelligence headbands are an exception to the usual rules about shutting up and obeying orders and Sevar is not high circle enough for him to put up with it from her

I have eight years on them and have gotten generous hazard pay that whole time for my service to Cheliax at the Worldwound My salary from just the first two days was enough for the rest of the way to a headband which Ive been saving up for anyway theyre not going to be able to afford it for a while because this is their first job ever and theyre being very generously paid but not a headband every two days generously paid

Keeping in mind that a wrong answer to this question will get both of us killed does Keltham believe that

Carissa is unsure why he keeps reminding her of that She has never forgotten it even for half a second If he has an objection itll be a Kelthamish itll be that they ought to be really good candidates for a loan if theyve got a guaranteed high salary for the next month or something like that But the loan process is probably complicated when the job is completely secret and also you cant honestly say you expect to have it in a month and also you cant go to the bank to do it and also he expects us to be incompetent at things if I say that loans on future income arent really a thing he will just make his general face about Golarion Look I am not willing to die so I can wear an intelligence headband more if I thought it would help for me to take it off around him Id take it off around him but its around him that I keep being not quick enough and smart enough to manage things I cant reason it out cleverly in advance and then just execute while slightly stupider because I dont get him well enough to predict his exact reactions yet If when I put the headband on I actually suddenly can predict him in advance then Ill take it off around him but Abarco cant predict him in advance and hes got a plus 4 

He casts an orison that lashes her in the face hard enough to do an exactly trivial amount of damage to a third circle wizard Hell wouldnt have instructed them to punish Sevar no less than she earned if she was never going to earn any punishments Keep me informed of your judgments Dont argue them at me Youre very obviously driven to get an intelligence headband and wear it Sevar Theres justifications for that good enough to get me to go along with it Its also a very standard form of wizard bullshit and the way that you will argue with your superiors about this one topic makes it clear that you are a very standard wizard in this regard

Were done here Sevar with me Balaguerre make sure someones around who can cast Foxs Cunning on her when she requests it

If its only wizards that think its important to be smarter then maybe thats whats wrong with the church of Asmodeus in Golarion Keepers would want to be smarter she bets theyd be careful about it but theyd want it 

She keeps this to herself 

Maillol is heading back to his office Once theyre out of range of the security office if not of security he speaks again Word of warning Sevar Keltham is right that our usual schools teach people what to think not how to think and I should hardly need to say that the reason is that if they did their own thinking theyd fuck it up Unless your vision succeeds far beyond what any reasonable person would expect a Chelish academy based on Keltham style teaching is going to have two kinds of people in it Priests of Asmodeus and citizens valuable enough that they qualify for our very limited soul sale slots If Id realized that faster we couldve brought in older women whod already sold their souls and not used up a hell of a lot of our projects slack on having a bunch of baby wizards do it but whats done is done

I may be reading too much into Hells instructions we get told not to put too much weight on exact wordings that passed through three increasingly less intelligent devils on their way from Asmodeus to us but it seems to me that Asmodeus gave you four instructions in order and they may have been an order of priority Serve Him well in this world dont fall to heresy figure out the differences between yourself and an axiomite and become the kind of soul Asmodeus wishes mortals were and join His most treasured possessions If all we learn from Keltham is tricks for smelting vast quantities of high quality metal it will not in fact make this project a failure in the eyes of Church and Queen even if that falls short of your own ambitions for it

 understood But what if you could teach them a better what to think one that held together against more of their own impulses but hes right that no one else can reasonably bet on that just off Carissa wanting it and Asmodeus thinking Carissa worth steering 

Youre not accustomed to being in the inner circle where you are expected to do your own thinking and put your life on the line for getting it right Usually people get brought into it less abruptly than you and its possible Im going to get called up on having trusted you more than you earned contrary to Hells instructions My belief is that you earned it by understanding Keltham better than Abarco does but you also havent held that much responsibility before and my decision to dump it on you is going to look lethally questionable if you fuck it up I cannot guarantee that I wasnt influenced by knowing or thinking I knew that you were a competent enough person to come to the momentary attention of a god Asmodeus help us all if He was trying to tell us exactly not to do what I just did by trusting you more than youd earned But we also got told to trust you no less than youd earned so

Thats all to frame an important point Sevar which is that the theological discussions that Asmodean priests hold among themselves are different from the way you learned theology out in the cold We do not sound like fucking Keltham because we are not fucking outsiders But if a new priest has an affinity for slavery and a fifth circle priest specializes in tyranny the fifth circle priest doesnt tell her to shut up and write down the standard answers he gives her about slavery

From the standpoint of tyranny feeling gratitude for Asmodeus owning us is how we tell the common people to feel about it because its a simple fucking answer that wont get them in trouble Occasionally though Asmodeus goes and makes a bed slave His cleric which shows that His true priorities do not always match those that we harried and overworked mortals try to set We almost always decide to wait on perfecting souls into the exact shape Asmodeus prefers until they get safely to Hell Asmodeus cares in ways we dont even try to care because its not productive when we try to do it If that bed slave feeling some exact form of gratitude for being a slave was a vital part of what our Lord wishes mortals were like you may need to wait for a priest who understands slavery more deeply than I do to tell you that because instructing me in those details wasnt the Churchs own priority for a Worldwound administrator

You have tyranny questions I can answer those in endless detail and youd be stupid to argue until you understand Asmodeanism a lot better But I will be checking some of the answers I gave you about slavery and pride the next time I run into a superior of mine who has a moment Thats as much priority as Id give to a fourth circle priest asking me those questions if the fourth circle priest didnt tell me they were more urgent

Final warning Dont get lost in all these fascinating questions youre supposed to think about for the first time Asmodeus instructed you to serve Him well in this world first

Are we done Sevar Ill still be here if you have more questions another day and you said Keltham was waiting on you Maillol thinks and hopes this is exactly as much slack for interrupting him as hed cut a fourth circle cleric on urgent project business who was interrupting him for the first time

She does not exactly feel readier to answer Keltham Were done

Go with Hells unusually personal blessing Sevar He taps her with the Guidance orison for the little bit thats worth

Was someone going to get me a Foxs Cunning 

And then someone does by jabbing her in the shoulder After this shes going to need to work on having a better working relationship with Abarco 

Foxs Cunning feels good it feels right and shes been told to correct for that shes been told its a flaw common to wizards and shes not willing to trade her life for more of it so shes going to do what she was told and not reach for it more than she already has 

She closes her eyes and tries to drive out everything except the questions she has to answer tonight 

First serve Asmodeus in this world Get close to Keltham close enough that when he gets sick of Cheliax he takes you with him Hold things together for long enough to learn new things about metalworking new things about everything else that makes dath ilan prosperous but keep in mind that the thinking is not the priority for the Chelish government or the Church They might be making a mistake and Carissa might be poised to correct them but they probably arent making a mistake and they wont believe her now

 she has the option of telling Keltham that Not tonight but its a thought to tuck away for later its not damning that the Chelish government trusts the metalworking to lead somewhere useful more than the habits of mind 

 Kelthams sideways habits of inference are not in fact sideways theyre going to be a perfectly natural outgrowth of the things hes taught them in class right now you dont know what hell infer from a given bit of information might be the best unenhanced Carissa can do but she needs that to stop being true as quickly as possible replaced with the exact habits of inference herself and it might not even be the best unenhanced Carissa can do its certainly not the best she can do now In fact her mind is now rather spamming possibilities Keltham thinks in some theory of human psychology that extends from education to sex it has gears even if she doesnt know them He doesnt think sideways he thinks in theories that make things be connected He arrived in Golarion and noticed that it wasnt all women and went up to the theory about sex balances and where they came from and down again to know that mortals werent made by gods He noticed that people were wearing fixed cheerful expressions in class and went up to some theory about people and down again to how those kinds of people might be having sex Carissa deeply wants to know this theory Carissa manages to wrench her attention away from how much she wants to know this theory Keltham wouldnt be stuck thinking about that if he didnt want to be shes seen inside his mind

Keltham thinks in equilibriums he notices when a strategy seems possible to deviate profitably from without being punished Keltham is from a societal context where competence at deception is not itself a valuable thing to signal because deception is basically frowned upon in every context Last one feels most immediately fruitful though its easier than it was a moment ago to hold the other ones apart and not subtly downgrade them in her mind because shes started following the third Keltham didnt parse them as signaling competence at deception because you signal things you want people to know about and even if you want to be deceptive you wouldnt want people to know you want to be deceptive Whereas in Cheliax wait check is this only true in Cheliax because if not shed better not say it 

 she should have a specific other country in mind when she tells Keltham how Cheliax works Now that she thinks of it it seems very obvious Keltham will be incredulous and disbelieving even about things she knows to be functional equilibriums but that doesnt mean that every lie she can think of telling is equally credible as a functioning equilibrium Societies are complicated and she cant invent Cheliax but LN but she can tell Keltham how some place he wouldnt flee from works Taldor is the obvious one She doesnt know all that much about Taldor but shes met people from there and its culturally descended from Cheliax unlike Osirion or some place where she cant represent how the people there would explain themselves The main thing everyone knows about Taldor is that it has a weak crown and too many dukes and counts who think too highly of themselves and its been wracked with civil war periodically for a long time not falling only because the crown is old and rich and can hold Oppara where their power is invested no matter the madness that goes on beyond its walls Quick check has she claimed anything about Cheliax actively contradicted by that She doesnt think so Has anyone else 

 she can delegate that she has authority here 

I need someone to check whether anyone has said anything to Keltham that would be inconsistent with Cheliax being approximately Taldor in political organization and culture until the Church backed the right side in the most recent civil war and Hell sent some people to try to shape the crown up

And now shes followed that train of thought far enough and needs to pull back and contemplate an entirely different one she can see from here how shes been neglecting that before going with her intuition until it is actually surprised or contradicted somewhere 

 Keltham has a general theory of human nature that is surprised by Golarion not just by Cheliax so hes missing something and itd be useful to figure out what both because she might want to tell him and because itll help with verisimilitude Hes missing and her mind is spamming possibilities again not that shes confident in any of them that people signal negative qualities That people prefer for other people to lose that people have values actively incompatible with other people getting what they want that people are bad enough at thinking that trying to make them think about something is dangerous many of these are too specifically Chelish 

This would be much simpler if she could make Keltham tell her all the theories he uses to understand people Maybe she can sell her superior or just the one superior now on the theory that if they ask Keltham to explain those parts Keltham will be easier to fool

 set that aside too flagged as maybe possibly coming from the part of her that is tempted to trade off lifespan against intelligence headbands

Keltham has learned more from them than theyve learned from him He is surprised by Golarion he is missing something he underadjusts or overadjusts or adjusts along completely wrong dimensions but hes notably much less wrong than he was a day ago already They will not be able to hide things in the vast fog of his confusion for very long because he is narrowing it 

They should tell him less if they possibly can They should say its not the priority that gets their project more support and headbands delivered earlier They should say they dont know They should find legitimately very important questions they can ask Keltham instead of spending lots of time explaining things to him She should find something simple to say to him about sex thats true everywhere in Golarion and only later if ever ask him to explain theories

Its not a pleasant thought not the answer that she wanted inside at all and Carissa might not have managed to think it before she saw inside Kelthams head

Foxs Cunning wears off and leaves her tired And in a bad mood And now she still doesnt feel any closer to figuring out what to say to Keltham but she remembers the direction shed found when she was smarter and she knows perfectly well how being smarter works that its a glimpse of a person you want to grow up to be even if you have to be dragged kicking and screaming because its not always pleasant for the tiny stupid things that humans are to grow into bigger smarter things 

Is he still on the roof

Yes Elias says irritably

She hurries

It got a little cold and lonely up on the roof without Carissa to lean against

Keltham solved this problem by going down wandering around randomly for a bit not seeing any security anywhere he looked calling out for Security in a not especially loud voice seeing somebody step around a corner a third of a minute later and you know you would think that if this whole place had elaborate tunnels in the walls for security to hide and that was being kept secret and not told to him they would be hiding this fact by having some visible security officers but fine Anyways Keltham then asked if there was such a thing as magic to keep him warm since the roof had no obvious switchable infrared lamp heaters and the problem got solved

After that the roof was about as good a place to think as his bedroom with an increased probability of later Carissa materialization

Keltham is currently wondering if maybe Golarion just sort of collectively lacks the form of Law aspiring thought where if you have a problem you try to think of a way you could rearrange reality such that you wouldnt have the problem anymore

It would explain everything hes seen in one sense But explains too many things he hasnt seen in another Somebody invented stairs as a solution to the problem of climbing to the roof thereby falsifying the general form of the theory Maybe that was before they invented wizard based contraception and bred intelligence out of themselves though Or maybe devils told them how to make stairs

Hes aware its not a very plausible theory But sometimes when you dont get something it can be productive to play with impossible theories or even frustrated yelling at reality in case that knocks something loose so long as you dont just keep on doing that

Hey you oh its warm up here

Oh good It was getting too cold for me all by myself without you so I reacted to this unsatisfactory state of reality by visualizing alternative and better ways reality could coherently be and seeing if any of those alterative states of affairs were attainable by my actions which led to me asking a security officer if there was any magic for staying warm

By a similar line of reasoning Keltham was considering sex with Ione if Carissa never returned and he felt sufficiently disappointed about that

What is that supposed to mean

Well I reacted to the unsatisfactory state of reality where I had no idea how to communicate to you about sex by visualizing alternative and better ways reality could coherently be and seeing if any of those alternative states of affairs were attainable by my actions and getting advice from someone smarter and the conversation ended up mostly being about other things but I do have an explanation about the sex thing Does dath ilan have social deception games

We sure do have games with social deception and parts of society where its understood to be fun if we let things play out in a competitive deceptive way but we try to keep it out of science and commerce and management and politics or any other context where getting it right matters more than getting it fun Both kinds of sexual negotiation exist but in dath ilan itd always be very clear which kind of sexual negotiation you were in at any given time

Okay In Golarion people mostly do the games with social deception kind of sex and I wasnt actually planning to because my incentives are very strongly tilted against accidentally confusing or alarming or upsetting you but we dont strictly delineate them and I wasnt assuming you werent planning to and I was slightly worried the entire concept is one Good people dont invent I am glad that they do theyd be missing out on a lot of fun

I do not in fact understand the thought process whereby this was a sufficiently worrying thought that you needed to consult your best local equivalent of a Keeper but its okay that I dont understand that I dont expect to understand everything for a fair while and you dont need to explain it in any more detail if youd rather do other things with our time I express clear acceptance and affordance for you to suddenly need to go check with Keepers while talking to the alien whether it was yourself you were trying to protect by doing that or me

I dont know whether my own statement there makes any psychological sense to you as something that a person would naturally say in my position but its a sincere speech act for whatever thats worth

I think I understood around the edges of it If Id properly had that thought in so many words I wouldve just said it but instead I just noticed the confusion and all of the attempts I generated to communicate it started a hundred steps back in very confusing territory which I am going to blame on all this talking to an alien miscalibrating me about how impossible to expect communication to be And now I think I do want to do other things with our time if you want to

Sounds good to me Retrieve an item from the conversational recursion layers all the way back to dath ilani sex technology questions or pick up somewhere else

Sex technology Is there sex technology for turning into a dragon so you can have sex as a dragon

He leans back against her like when they were on this part of the conversational stack before restoring the state of the earlier function call

Probably not and Im considering how close somebody has gotten but first I need to know what a dragon might be

They are reptilian magic what we call sorcerers they dont have to shape the magic deliberately they can do it from intuition and dont die of old age they just keep growing larger Ancient ones are a thousand feet long and wouldnt be able to fly at all if they werent very very magic by that point usually people Polymorphing into dragons to have sex go for smaller ones because Polymorphing things much larger and more magical than your native form requires very powerful spells They breathe fire or spit acid or various other nasty things depending on planar affinities

Yeah we cant actually do that Closest anybody wouldve come materially would be building a giant mechanical thing that could have sex with you or that you could control to fuck somebody And though its sort of a cheating answer well cheating is technique so I expect that the closest people have come to that experience is that theres probably some set of drugs you can get in a Shop of Ill Advised Consumer Goods which will let you I dont know put on a costume or stare at a moving picture and experience that you are a dragon with some amount of hallucinatory sensory remapping But if I have to resort to saying thats how wed do it then you win in terms of the technology question

To be fair I cant personally do that either As a mere third circle wizard I can turn into any woman youve ever met or heard of but only for six minutes and they have to be humanoid

Okay I hopefully wont have to suddenly go meta too often but for purposes of rapidly learning how romance works around here that was totally a probe to find out what kind of women I find physically attractive right Where the fact that you can and will call any bluffs by transforming into that person forces me to be honest And on my side I can choose between flattering you by listing women who look more like you or teasing you by listing say Lrilatha Because that would not that this is a problem or anything that would definitely be Complicated Romance rather than Straightforward Romance in dath ilan

 huh Thats Straightforward Romance around here Complicated Romance involves hiring specialized seduction devils to test peoples monogamy commitments whove made them or something Anyway I dont have much riding on being your type because every girl youre going to find heres got light brown skin and dark brown eyes and hair saying Lrilatha would be a Complicated Romance response because the possibility is real that shed hear about it I think maybe my mental delineation is whether we have introduced non romance stakes Shes kind of bad at not telling Keltham things this is a bad thing to be bad at

Oh ho are there other varieties of girl to be found elsewhere in Golarion Perhaps I should ask for pictures before I decide

 are there not in dath ilan Peoples native to different countries look different they have dark skin near the equator and people far up north are very pale with very light hair and people in Tian Xia look Tian I dont know how to describe it exactly but its very distinctive their face shapes are different and their hair is finer and thinner and black even though they are pale

We dont have that no because anyone can go anywhere with a quarter days cost of labor Even if we started out with less travel way back when after a few generations of everybody mating with everybody all over the planet I guess all the heritages just blended together People probably cared at all about preserving variety of appearance back when that variety was dying out its just theres so many other things to select on when you try to decide who youre going to have kids with and its so much not a place where itd be Governances place to solve the collective problem by telling people they needed to start doing assortative mating on appearance instead Forbidden costs not much of a reward Even in dath ilan we cant get all the public goods at once

 huh Well that makes two things Golarion has going for it on the sex front a reasonable match of sadism and masochism and distinctive races I have heard Chelish men assert that northern girls are the prettiest but they were at the Worldwound and mightve been just trying to win points with the locals

 Couldnt Carissa just observe whether they said the same thing around only other Chelish people
 Not being able to clearly tell on the meta level whether or not it is currently a time for social deception games to be going on seems super inconvenient and like somebody could get hurt

Keltham sets it aside he does not need to solve all puzzles simultaneously more evidence will arrive in time and if jumping at every confusion prevents him from ever getting laid then this would constitute a symptom of meta level dysfunction Like its one thing to do that when confusions happen once an hour but another to do it when they happen once per minute

Instead Keltham says Now I really want to ask what you think is the best thing Golarion has going for it sexually but spoilers

Well I dont know if its a spoiler if we cant do it Theres a seventh circle spell called Waves of Ecstasy which incapacitates everyone around with overwhelming pleasure and I dont think thats the best thing Golarion has to offer but if it were it seems like it wouldnt really be a spoiler for our evening myself not being seventh circle Yet

That sure does sound like the absolutely classic example of something youd only see in a Shop of Ill Advised Consumer Goods Wait wizard spells are like that because theyve mostly got to be useful in combat right Is there a class of combats someone can best fight with Waves of Ecstasy Because that sounds like Taldane doesnt have the word for trope A particular literary theme

I think its a modification of a very similar spell that incapacitates everyone around less pleasantly But no there are no monsters Ive ever heard of whose secret weakness is sexual pleasure

And Golarion doesnt have the thing where if there were monsters like that you wouldnt find out until you passed a sexual experience test So if you havent heard about them they probably dont exist Check

Some places in Golarion might have something like that but Cheliax does not withhold any information about the weaknesses of monsters from its soldiers deployed at the Worldwound so yes

 right Sometimes I forget that youre a seasoned emergency response official on a level where I dont even know who in Civilization would be comparable to you Even best on continent championship medical responders probably dont stack up to literally actually fighting alien invaders every day

There are championship medical responders How do you evaluate them against each other presumably they havent all addressed the same emergencies

Standardized trials of course With prediction markets about performance under real future possibilities in case somebody is only testing well in a way that the markets can notice

Oh you were probing about people I find attractive so I cant show her to you until I learn an illusion spell and maybe something that boosts my memory but in terms of people I wouldve screwed if I couldve made it to where I could screw almost anyone compatible and available ah background Theres this one woman who was on scores alone the second best endurance medical responder for a region containing a quarter of the planetary population She wasnt the person youd call in for one person having a brief medical emergency she was the person whose performance degraded the least if she had to work for sixteen hours straight Except at her level never mind sixteen hours she could go for like thirty

Now consider all of the Alien Invasion Rehearsal people and the sections of Governance who think about weird scenarios where for some reason you cant send in ten medical techs you have to send one medical tech who works ten times as long Everybody wanted her in their weird emergency response plans The number one endurance medical responder for her region wasnt into working with Governance on weird scenarios nearly as much or the number one people for other regions they just wanted to spend all their time responding to medical emergencies go figure So she was like spending half her time on actual patients and half of her time maintaining all of her certifications for being hypothetically called in on every imaginable kind of weird medical emergency by every branch of Exception Handling Lots of people watching the transmitted moving pictures of her doing that treating simulated aliens that famous authors dreamed up things like that She was rank 5 famous only one in a hundred thousand people had more identity recognition than her If you were really lucky you might personally see her simultaneously treating four pretend wounded bodies during an Alien Invasion Rehearsal Festival Or during an Oops Its Time To Overthrow The Government Festival which was when Keltham had actually been pretend nearly killed by the Hypothetical Corrupted Governance Military and gotten his game life saved by her in person And also she was pretty Merrin was her name

Hed almost said Miran but remembered the difference between her game alias and her real name barely in time which is a little embarrassing for somebody who was once your teenage crush

Because it is entirely hypothetical the idea of a crisis where one person might need to work for thirty hours straight Carissa being a wizard hasnt done it herself and she can certainly appreciate the exceptional talent inherent in not having your performance degrade over the course of thirty hours but clerics at the Worldwound work hours like that during every rush at least once every month 

To be the right trade for Asmodeus Keltham does not have to solve everything or even half a percent of everything

If he teaches us metalworking that would be enough

 neat she says and giggles How do Alien Invasion Rehearsal Festivals go

Well just because we dont have endless hordes rushing at us from the Chaotic Evil afterlife doesnt mean wed like to all pathetically roll over and die if someday we did get invaded though usually wed suppose them to be invading with machines or cleverness So we try to prepare ourselves rehearse for it just in case Some of the best writers and the best just in case military people and maybe some Keepers I dont know all get together and plan out how they would invade us if they were aliens with particular capabilities Then during the Alien Invasion Rehearsal Festival they get to tell us this city got wiped out or everybody in this region just got mind controlled or whatever and then everybody in the region who got mind controlled will pick up whatever pretend weapons they get issued and rush over to pretend to try to kill the rest of us And I mean that also increases resilience if someplace gets hit by a catastrophic earthquake because people have rehearsed who to coordinate with and which houses to check and how to look for bodies before their brains rot that sort of thing But running it as an Alien Invasion Rehearsal Festival instead is more fun

Sex technology sexy alien invasion rehearsal festivals yes or no

Has absolutely happened on a citywide scale but only in a city where everybody opted into that and all the underage kids got sent away for that day

Are kids not allowed to participate in sexy alien invasion rehearsal I guess they probably wouldnt have passed their competence tests 

Well everything is a spoiler at that age

Are you supposed to figure it all out yourself I feel that this would lead to some hilarious misconceptions Like the jokes about peasants who go to a priest thinking theyre infertile and it turns out they just hadnt known youre supposed to put it in

You try for a period to see where you end up on your own and then you learn about the standard optimal way of doing it As opposed to I dont know starting out by knowing all about how it goes That sounds a lot less exciting

Girls would get pregnant If they didnt know how to avoid that 

Carissa has been specifically directed to stop entertaining opinions about things like that Its bad for her eternal soul And to stop telling Keltham things for no reason Its bad for her longevity Maybe another thing were doing all wrong for foolish reasons she says I guess you could ask the girls if theres anyone who has no idea what shes doing 

That sounds a biiit more dangerous in a world where theres serious diseases transmitted by sex and no cheap contraception though I guess a wizard could afford to solve both of those but you dont seem like youd be able to afford clever infrastructure for keeping secrets like that from only exactly the people who can afford to stay ignorant So Im mostly guessing youre joking

Aaaaaargh hes already good enough at inference its hard to gloss over things Yeah I would be surprised if you found any takers in Cheliax There are some countries that protect their daughters from sex by not letting them near men instead of by telling them about it so I guess you could try to meet those once we steal all the women from all the countries that dont let them do things

Thats the most horrible take on spoiler protection that Keltham has ever heard

I suppose they may as well get some benefit out of it yes But it wouldnt be me having sex with them I already know where to put it unless the people older than me have been hiding the real target area

And spoiler protected people are supposed to only play with each other Shes not going to ask I think its sweet how you get angry about the women in the countries that dont let them do things I get angry about that but most people dont and I think I started feeling specifically fond of you as an individual instead of as the vehicle for the most important thing that I can reasonably do when you first heard about it and decided we should steal them

Youre angrier than average huh Guessing thats not so much because it was your choice of diverse cause area and more because theres so many even worse things to worry about in Golarion if you pick based on calculation instead of emotional pull

Yes Other people are being entirely reasonable and I cant defend my fondness for the idea against fixing some other equally bad or worse thing but the one that happens to make me angry is that one

It is a reasonable thing to be angry about I will not mind if all of you take it a little slower on telling me even more things to be even angrier about if there isnt any reason I need to know right away Rapidly learning about lots of things to be angry about does not sound optimal for my mental state Im not a Keeper

Yet says a tiny voice inside him which Keltham decides after a due pause is probably due to internal pessimization over things for internal voices to say rather than due to internal prediction from knowledge he hasnt acknowledged to himself

And thats also the advice I got from someone who sort of was In a manner of speaking Well not at all actually she thought of it herself but its a good excuse to stop telling him things which she should That I should be aiming at telling you about decision relevant bad things rather than about ensuring that in the smallest possible time interval you know all of the awful things in a world full of them except we dont totally understand your decision procedures so I shouldnt try to have that much ownership of it on my own but that it seemed likely to him we might err on the side of trying to press right on through every awful atrocity that Chelish parents protect their children from knowing of and I know more of them than a usual adult even because of the Worldwound 

We can take it a bit slower Youre bearing up very well under it but uh conventional wisdom in Cheliax which you might think is very foolish is that the more important someones business the more important they have lots of nice things

Well sure thats why we coordinate to pay people who produce public goods for us and why its considered a good thing that people who produce not so public goods become wealthy too You want to incentivize people to do important things and you also want them to be less distracted by unimportant things If I didnt have something in my model producing that conclusion already Id have been confused why your society was giving me what is by your standards very expensive living conditions

Just to be clear I want to know it all eventually I am not that much of a not Keeper especially in a world thats much more dangerous But if nothing else theres got to be more sensible ways of prioritizing what I need to learn first than prioritizing it by how much it shocks me

Yes of course But I notice that now tonight we keep getting distracted away from nice things with horrible ones despite agreeing that you need nice things very much and I propose that that means were doing something wrong

You make a compelling case All right lets see if we can go the entire rest of the night without talking about anything horrifying Well except that at some point before dawn tomorrow I have to test my remaining cleric spells and any appropriate warning signs on those should in fact be clearly laid out to me But when it comes to everything else if for some reason I need not to do something in the cuddleroom and the reasons are horrifying you can totally not tell me why just not to do it And even if the reasons arent horrifying you still shouldnt tell me to maintain plausible deniability Oh Taldane has a single syllable word for that thats helpful

Okay Dont turn into a girl with red hair and creepy fangs Thats all Ive got but Ill let you know more if I think of them

She totally did that on purpose Right then Dont turn out to be asexual See how you like hearing about what is very clearly going to be a very interesting story that isnt going to be explained right now

What does that even mean It does not quite parse as celibate and is obviously the opposite of sexual but she doesnt know how to have sex in an un sexual fashion if she wanted to Ill do my best while not knowing what that is

Some people dont have any sexual desires or they dont find it in themselves except under very rare conditions and obviously if youre the first sort and wish you werent youre never quite certain youre not secretly the second kind wait thats a sad thing shouldnt have said it

If we were having advanced sex instead of beginner sex I would propose that we hit people when they say sad things Maybe for beginner sex we could tickle people when they say bad things With a feather are there tickle technologies 

Oh wow there are people who gain arousal points from being tickled Because I am pretty sure I wouldnt though I suppose we could very briefly try

Keltham decides not to say because it would be another sad thing that unless theres a secret population of dath ilani who do gain arousal from being tickled a torture machine is not something you would be allowed to sell even in a Shop of Ill Advised Consumer Goods Well maybe if you put intrinsic surveillance technology into it and only let people use it on themselves so they could practice being way too mentally disciplined Or maybe the Keepers have some incredibly unpleasant technology hidden for extremely unlikely emergencies

Point to Carissa in the sex games wars yes there are people who gain arousal points from being tickled and even more who gain arousal points for futile ly struggling to avoid being tickled

Keltham visualizes this Boops the same internal part that was booped by hair pulling check I wonder if I would be the first dath ilani to ever build a tickling machine It would automatically be the best tickling machine ever unless people here have built even better ones

Well you know we do our best with our deficient tech level but I bet richer people can build more terrifying tickling machines

Hmmm I suppose to be properly terrifying it should chase you down snatch you up and maybe hold you there while the tickle devices approach closer and closer Which is going to take magic if I want to build it here without waiting an additional one hundred years to climb the technology ladder first Is that cheating I ask because I like to know whether what Im doing is cheating not because Im going to do it any differently depending on your answer

It seems to me like it might be complicated building a tickling machine while trying to prevent the escape of your ticklee You could call in security but that would be cheating

Oh the idea is that you build the tickling machine in advance and dont tell them about that so it can be a sudden cuddleroom surprise But I can see how a thought that Chaotic wouldnt occur to such a very Lawful woman from such a very Lawful country

Luring women into your cuddleroom under false pretenses to surprise them with tickle machines I wouldnt have believed you capable of it And I am delighted to be wrong

All romantic relationships in Golarion are competitive deceptive ones right I dont even have to put up a warning sign saying it might happen Its just assumed

Indeed You still arent even cheating The cuddlerooms all have implicit signs beware may contain tickle machines and dangerous boys and possibly the sexy kind of dragon

This explains a lot about why people here never go into the cuddlerooms and just have sex in their bedrooms instead

We built great elaborate cuddlerooms but then we got carried away and filled them up with goblins and mimics and treasure chests and traps and spike pits and they were too dangerous for all but the bravest adventurers and we retreated defeated to have sex in our beds

Probability 1 that this has totally happened multiple times in dath ilan with somebody putting way too much overengineered sextech in their thousand labor hour cuddleroom

If everyone has sex in their cuddleroom is it kinky to have sex in your bed Like having sex on your dining room table except comfier than that

Seems slightly mildly naughty yes Though youd want a very advanced self cleaning bedroom Or more likely a spare bedroom you could use instead until you or somebody you hired at a high price cleaned out all the lubricants and other fluids

Well I guess you could just have quick uncomplicated sex on the bed that didnt call for much of anything to be externally lubricated But that seems to defeat the point of the kinkiness which is I assume to wreck the bedroom as much as possible in the course of having complicated sex in it

Now room wrecking sex we dont actually have much of that probably because of how we are terribly poor Most decent beds can stand up to having someone chained to them for hours of exciting adventures As long as no one turns into a dragon

Theres a proverb that goes If youve never broken a cuddling device you dont have a name for youre not having vigorous enough sex Of course then they started making ones that would not break under any realistic circumstances and the proverb became obsolete but it stayed in the language

Well with magic healing I feel we should be able to one up you but I admit I am not sure how If youve never broken a spine youre not having vigorous enough sex If youve never broken an immovable rod youre not having vigorous enough sex If youve never broken an extradimensional sex dungeon youre not having vigorous enough sex But I have never broken any of those things so I guess perhaps everyone Ive slept with was very bored

Oh its part of a whole family of adages about being too risk averse in cases where errors are recoverable If youve never lost money on an investment youre betting too conservatively If youve never failed a test youre taking lessons that are too easy So for sex in Golarion as practiced by someone who can afford healing spells it would say that if youve never broken an ankle during sex youre not trying sufficiently precarious sex positions

Carissa is having trouble imagining what kind of sex practiced by avowed non sadists might nonetheless break ankles but she decides not to ask Perhaps she will learn firsthand later if she stops derailing the conversation 

Well I have never broken an ankle having sex either I dont think Ive broken anything more exciting than a uniform button

Well lets not aim to correct that immediately It seems like an activity that could legitimately be reserved for the third date or later I dont think it counts if you do it on purpose anyways we just have to keep escalating until something interesting happens

Youre the expert Maybe escalating until sex is positively dangerous is how they all handle their suppressed sadism 

I had in fact been under the impression that between the two of us you were the expert But comparisons over expertise are better settled in domain contest than in argument

Well on Golarion people who like to hurt people just do that and so theres less suppressed sexual tension pushing them towards bafflingly risky and furniture destroying sex acts So in that one specific dimension you have us beat but for everything else a domain contest does seem called for Youre not dressed for it

Two seconds and three zippers later Keltham is displaying the dath ilani male version of plunging cleavage Our clothing technology enables rapid adaptation to many purposes Point to us

Wow Golarion clothing 

 well probably someone has clothing that does that Probably inheriting Countesses of Cheliax have clothing that do that and Carissa should have asked about it as a higher priority than asking to be prettier Carissa owns three outfits her dress uniform and her undress uniform and her sleeping clothes and they do not do that 

Also what was that mechanism it looked mechanical 

I will have you know she says slightly sternly that I am with a heroic effort of will refraining from derailing this flirtatious conversation to ask how your clothing fasteners work But in the morning nothing will deter me

They work very well thank you Your move Carissa Sevar

Keltham is expending his own virtuous effort to avoid thinking about zipper patent licensing

Well now youre dressed for the occasion and Im dressed for entirely the wrong occasion I would be perfectly dressed to defend you from demons but regrettably security is doing that Also one sometimes breaks an ankle doing that and I hear that breaking ankles is a third date sort of thing Maybe I could defend you from a particularly aggressive nocturnal songbird Or a bat

Keltham zips down an additional distanceunit of cleavage just because his technological superiority lets him do that so easily I admit Ive never ticked had a girl defend me from a bat on a sexual experience assessment but you may be overestimating my prior corruption levels if you think you have to go that far for your next move

Im going to steal those clothes and wear them to class tomorrow this is your fair warning And having said that she doesnt want to give him time to dwell on it so she kisses him

The following NSFW subthread between Keltham and Carissa now occurs within this story and should be read before continuing on from here

kissing is not a human universal

This subthread has been set apart so that the main thread remains readable by people who would prefer zero sex scenes in their stories

A safeish for work summary of key events and snippets can be found here

sfw tldr kissing is not a human universal

The banquet hall of the Archdukes summer villa is spacious and extravagant and with all of the torches going it is slightly terrifying or maybe it only feels that way because theyve been gathered here after Keltham left all of them except Carissa whos with Keltham and Ione who whatever happened with Nethys And theres security at the doors and if you did decide to kill them all youd maybe do it like this is the thing 

When the priest of Asmodeus announces that theyve been gathered here to sell their souls to Hell Meritxell is extraordinarily relieved That is one of the best possible explanations for all the important people gathered round really And it explains Iones absence without postulating shes been executed probably if you are an oracle of one god you cant sell your soul to another Its said that the servants of other gods are worthless rubble to Asmodeus fit only to be flattened into the paving stones of the streets of Hell by the stamping of millions of worthier feet 

But thats Iones problem Meritxell does not have that problem She only has the problem that she is damned to Hell which has been true since she reached six seven whatever age you have to be to sort at all and now she gets permanent arcane sight out of it which is the sort of thing wizards sell their souls for even when the fate of the soul in question is genuinely in doubt 

They separate the girls to review their contracts Meritxell casts Foxs Cunning on herself and reads through it even though if there are clever traps in contracts that wizards sign their souls for theyre not going to be ones you spot with ordinary wizardly cleverness She asks if this is the standard contract and gets a straight answer of yes so probably the only trick is the eternal damnation which was never really in doubt 

Asmodia never let herself think out loud at all that she didnt actually want to go to Hell It isnt necessarily a disloyal thought if you dont try to escape if you truly believe that escape is futile but the part of Asmodia that wordlessly and silently decided which thoughts were safe to think was afraid she might not think that It didnt seem urgent to that silent buried part of her She wasnt expecting to end up irrevocably damned this soon

Once you sell your soul you dont have to pass loyalty tests the same way because escape really is futile then

Once she sells her soul they probably wont execute her for what she thought just before then they probably wont execute her for thinking just before this about how she might not want to go to Hell 

Thinking just once in her lifetime to see if escape is possible even though shes already inside this locked room with security around it and they wouldnt have brought her to this villa if they werent sure of her as Lawful Evil which means that even if there were some way to kill herself shed just end up in Hell 

She doesnt sweat on the outside while she pretends to be reading her contract very carefully Shes thinking it shes finally thinking it now that its too late but there isnt enough hope in her really for her to sweat Theyre probably reading her mind right now and shes probably losing points but not so many points that they wont just let her sign and let Hell take good care of her later for her current sins

And it occurs to Asmodia to wonder at the last if maybe its all a lie because Cheliax

They told her almost everybody goes to an Evil afterlife That could be a lie

They told her that what shed already done was far more than enough to make her Evil That could be a lie

They teach that its not so easy to change that not so easy to repent once youve been part of the Chelish system that Pharasma doesnt just let you apologize That could be a lie even if her currently being Evil isnt a lie

They told her that the gods of Good are weak and not much use to anybody and that could be a lie

Ione isnt here and that means that whatever Nethys did to her it was enough to prevent them from making Ione sell her soul

Asmodias eyes go on moving across the parchment and she thinks the only one time in her life it will make sense to think that 

 that she was born into Cheliax and never had a chance to be anything else to be what her own nature would have led her to if Cheliax is lying to her about how much that doesnt matter if Pharasma has any whiny justice within Her of the sort that Cheliax teaches only for purposes of saying how pathetic it is 

 that she doesnt want to go to an Evil afterlife and if theres any god who isnt Evil or Chaotic Neutral who has any use for her or is Good enough to want to help her even if shes useless even if all they can do for her is accept her change of alignment and then kill her on the spot before she has to sell her soul then she wishes they would help her or shell work for them if she has a use in this life or in another She doesnt pray to any god who isnt Asmodeus even now because theyre probably reading her mind and that would be a step too far doesnt think the names of any other gods but Asmodeus even now 

Nethys Iomedae Sarenrae anybody

 just in case somebody is there after all

Nothing happens

Apparently Cheliax didnt lie to her about everything Shell pay for her disloyal thoughts then at one time or another

Asmodia asks whether the contracts that most wizards eventually sign are any different from the contract currently in front of her

She asks the devil the same when it appears and tries to negotiate for an intelligence boost and permanent arcane sight with the added condition that she swears shell never tell anybody that getting better deals from devils is possible

The devil doesnt hurt her for her presumptuousness if anything it seems amused The devil points out that if Asmodia doesnt sign shell be executed on the spot and Hell will get her soul anyways That she gets anything in exchange for her soul isnt about how much value her soul has to Asmodeus who already owns it She should be glad that Hells goals are advanced some tiny amount by her getting permanent arcane sight Maybe if shed been a better slave it would have advantaged Hell to give her more but they both know what a bad slave shes been Shes no longer allowed to sign this contract and stay out of Hell a few years longer by the way unless she can thank Hell for giving her anything at all in exchange for her already damned soul and mean it

The devil is visibly enjoying the conversation more than it might enjoy eating her on the spot

Asmodia says shes grateful for getting anything at all for her soul and manages to mean it as much as words in Cheliax ever mean anything

She signs

Later on a security wizard blandly informs her with just the tiniest hint of a smirk that one of the other students there got chosen as a Good gods oracle just before she could sign her contract apparently completely against her own will and without any part of herself having desired it in the slightest which is why that girl wont be spending the next few hours the way Asmodia will be spending hers

Asmodia is surprised by just how deep of a surge of hatred wells up inside her for that other girl and for the gods of Good even as she bows her head in acquiescence If later they want her to torture that other girl as a show of loyalty or eat a Sarenrae worshippers living flesh Asmodia will do it with pleasure

The first thing to understand about gods is that their attention is not only divided but splintered Their facets of themselves may not know all that other facets have recently learned

This is a fundamental fact about gods and from mortals it is hidden for it is the first step on a trail of secrets

The second thing to understand about gods is that it is expensive for them to look at the Material from more than the most abstract and predefined of directions Far more expensive for them to intervene especially if another god is opposing their intervention

This is partially a fundamental fact and partially stems from bargains that gods must make shapes into which they must place themselves to become gods without being destroyed by other gods

The third thing to understand about gods is that by far the most common equilibrium of their many conflicting interests is that all parties involved end up doing nothing to the Material This saves the energy and intervention budget of all parties

It seems likely that somebody or something made that be true so that a place such as the Prime Material could be That selector may have been Pharasma or it may have been something beyond even Her that determined the shape of Her own desires and powers

Nethys for reasons which may soon become clearer sometimes behaves as an exception to those rules Otolmens is also something of an exception in Her own way She is called goddess by those who lack finer categories but She is something older than that something that came into existence along with or shortly after the multiverse

Compared to intervening on reality it is energetically cheaper for gods to talk to each other seeking rare exceptions to the equilibria in which their conflicting wills neutralize This leaves a cost of attention but not every such conversation need consume the whole attention of a facet facets of gods can split off even tinier subfacets to try conversing with other gods subfacets Most of those potential conversations never get anywhere and are discarded sometimes they lead somewhere interesting and those possible conversations are then reconsidered by larger facets You could consider them as hypothetical conversations in a way or pseudo hypotheticals they do actually happen but usually not in a way that affects anything

The pseudohypothetical messages that these splinters of splinters trade between each other are sometimes so small and simple that they approach not spoken mortal voices but mortal writing though they are not of course mortal language of any kind

Irori has initiated pseudohypothetical chat
Nethys has joined the chat
Otolmens has joined the chat
Asmodeus has joined the chat
Abadar has joined the chat 
Irori Greetings Nethys
Nethys Heeeeeyyyy Irori wassup Not that part of Me doesnt already know I know everything Just not all of Me knows all of it at once
Irori As the god currently on best terms with both you and Otolmens Ive been pseudohypothetically asked by Abadar and Asmodeus to intercede between the two of you before this escalates further
Nethys Should I go get Nethys
Irori 
Irori Yes please
Nethys has left the chat
Nethys has joined the chat
Nethys Heeeeeyyyy Irori wassup Not that part of Me doesnt already know I know everything Just not all of Me knows all of it at once
Irori As the god currently on best terms with both you and Otolmens Ive been pseudohypothetically asked by Abadar and Asmodeus to intercede between the two of you before this escalates further
Nethys Oooh youre auspisticing
Irori If I was meant to understand that I didnt
Nethys Ive seen through vastly more planes and realms of existence than you and that means youre not going to get all of my references
Irori Nethys can you explain why you made a Chelish mortal into your oracle
Nethys Otolmens made a Chelish mortal into Her oracle I was just keeping the balance
Otolmens You did that BEFORE I chose My oracle I did it in response to YOU
Nethys This is one of those time things isnt it
Nethys Well if I hadnt appointed an oracle and then She did appoint an oracle the balance might have been upset
Nethys This way the balance ends up being kept for sure Totally a guardian of the balance after all Thats me all right Truuue Neutral
Irori Nethys you not only chose a mortal as your oracle you did some extremely complicated things to her curse Why To what purpose
Nethys Is this the first time weve met chronologically You dont sound like youre very familiar with Me
Irori According to Otolmenss decompilation of your curse if the mortal goes too long without reading any interesting books her soul gets pulled out and leaves behind a channel going back the other way that will carry what exactly
Nethys It depends on the exact circumstances but nothing elaborate by default Just a giant flood of energy that should wipe out everything in a half mile radius
Asmodeus What
Nethys Thats right I figured out how to rig oracles to explode
Nethys Isnt it great Read or die Ione Read or die
Asmodeus Every single positive thing that has ever come of giving mortals free will and Im not saying there were more than zero of those has been more than counterbalanced by the part where one of those mortals turned into this
Otolmens Hes not WRONG
Irori But what was the point of trapping the mortal to explode
Nethys Point
Asmodeus If it was meant as a deterrent we should have negotiated first You should know by now that Im shaped in a way where I ignore deterrent structures that havent been prenegotiated Its a very legible fact about me
Abadar Seriously Nethys This is not how gods should conduct themselves
Nethys Its not meant as a DETERRENT
Nethys Its meant as an EXPLOSION
Asmodeus Do you take me for a fool Nethys The fact that part of you intrinsically values explosions is not going to deceive me about whether some other part of you might have expected that putting the first part in charge of your oracles curse configuration would act as a deterrent to Me I am not shaped in a way that incentivizes attempted deterrence like that I am going to act exactly as if your exploding squirrel is incapable of influencing Me towards any course of action you might have preferred over My default action If that sets it off I will regard it as an unnegotiated attack by you
Nethys But you prooomised not to deliberately hurt two of the nearby mortals
Asmodeus My disregard of non negotiated deterrence structures does not contravene my compacts with either Abadar or Irori
Abadar I acknowledge this
Irori I acknowledge this
Otolmens I do NOT One single error in this sort of thinking is exactly how ALL OF REALITY could end up ACTUALLY being destroyed OUTSIDE of counterfactuals
Abadar Every god here understands that except apparently for Nethys
Nethys Thats because youre all Lawful Lawful Awful Lawful Boring
Asmodeus Its pronounced sane
Irori Courtesy please all of you
Otolmens Enough of THIS WHY did you make that mortal an oracle What was your INTENT
Nethys Youd have to ask whichever part of me originally did that
Irori Can you say which part of you did do it Nethys
Nethys What kind of answer are you looking for I dont exactly come with serial numbers
Irori Was it the destructive part of your nature I think that is the key question here
Nethys It was obviously a part of Myself that liked gigantic explosions but thats not narrowing it down by much
Nethys I mean you can love explosions because theyre destructive or because theyre so pretty and glowing and colorful or because the explosion shows off great technical skill in making whatever it is that exploded or because explosions can reveal how reality works at high energies or because hearing about enormous explosions can inspire students to be awed by the potential of magic and study more of it would you like me to continue listing the possibilities for how many different aspects of Nethys it could have been
Otolmens NO I am ONLY interested in knowing whether it was done by the part of Nethys that occasionally tries to EXPLODE ALL OF REALITY and has to be stopped by the REST of yourself and sometimes ME
Nethys Oh you mean the element of Myself that was looking in the wrong direction back when I first shattered into the simultaneous sight of everything I who once was human and then saw all of the souls in all of Hell and the Abyss and the few left in Abaddon and heard all their screams all at once Who saw the souls of children weeping in the Boneyard as they were judged by Pharasma for breaking rules they never knew and couldnt understand The part of Me that reacted the way anything with a lingering shred of humanity would react to forever being forced to gaze upon the horrors that you lot created That part of Me
Irori Without delving into old disagreements unlikely to be resolved today that does seem to be what Otolmens was asking about
Nethys I dont know actually
Nethys Im not the part of Nethys who knows which part of Nethys configured Iones curse
Nethys I mean it could have been this part of Me for all I know Im just not the part of Nethys who knows whether it was
Irori Can you get us the part of Nethys that knows which part of Nethys made the oracle and why
Nethys No Im not the part of Nethys that knows where to find the part of Nethys that knows where to find the part of Nethys that cursed Ione
Otolmens I wish so much that someone had managed to destroy this ONE god before it insinuated itself LITERALLY EVERYWHERE
Nethys Look if you want that part of Myself to stop repeatedly trying to destroy the multiverse and eventually succeeding you need to shut down the Evil afterlives Ive told you all this before
Asmodeus Out of the question Before you became a god you did not on net prefer to destroy reality rather than let it remain as it was I would not have needed to offer you anything else in order to put reality into a state where you preferred not to destroy it Your mad splintering of yourself is not something that can be allowed to change that You remain responsible for reining in that aspect of yourself if your greater self doesnt want it to destroy reality I will not grant you any extra concessions just because you splintered off one component of your utility function from the rest
Otolmens I do not CARE about any of that except insofar as all of this COMPLICATED divine negotiation is making my job HARDER
Abadar Otolmens please Everyone except Nethys is doing the obviously correct thing If we acted any other way it would incentivize a vastly greater number of threats to destroy reality It would incentivize threats that would not otherwise exist from any being powerful enough to destroy reality who preferred reality to be different from its ongoing state not just negotiation with powerful beings who honestly and without strategic self modification would prefer the destruction of reality to its baseline state
Otolmens All I HEAR is you repeatedly saying destroy reality in a context more complicated than DONT
Abadar Like it or not Otolmens the intricacies of agents modeling agents are part of the structure that upholds this multiverse Sometimes youve got to destroy counterfactual realities to preserve the real one
Asmodeus Or you could be too proud to give in to extortion even if a lunatic manages to splinter themselves into pieces that occasionally try to destroy the multiverse in a way that they think isnt technically extortion That also works if youre Me
Otolmens It works until it SUDDENLY DOESNT
Nethys Do you think those parts of Me are the only entity youre pissing off by continuing like this There are things staring angrily at you that are each individually vaster than our entire multiverse glaring at you from directions you cant even understand from orthogonal angles to the ultimate reality underneath reality Hi by the way
Asmodeus This This is what happens when you allow squirrels to become too large You get large insane squirrels
Nethys THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY TO PRE EMPTIVELY ANNIHILATE WIZARDS WHO ACTUALLY EARN THEIR OWN GODHOOD
Nethys AND ONE OF THEM TRIES TO DISPERSE HIMSELF OVER ALL OF REALITY HOPING THAT ENOUGH OF HIS FRAGMENTS SURVIVE
Nethys AND SOME OF HIS PIECES WATCH YOU TORTURING PEOPLE AFTER THEY DIE AND MAKING THEM HURT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS UNTIL THEY TURN INTO MONSTERS
Nethys All of you except Irori made your own fucking bed when it comes to Me and all of you can fucking lie in it
Nethys has disconnected
Irori I believe that makes this a failed pseudohypothetical conversation and we call rollback on it unless any of you have any remaining business before we break it up
Iomedae has joined the chat
Iomedae Hi Irori dont often see you around Hi Otolmens Hi Abadar
Iomedae Nethys told me there was some kind of convocation of Lawful gods going on about an interesting situation in Cheliax
Asmodeus Oh no
Abadar I believe Nethys was trying as an act of spite to further complicate a situation thats already too complicated I believe that beings such as ourselves will all be better off on average if we all postcommit to ignore such information in such situations
Iomedae Right Ill just show myself out then
Iomedae Though fair warning Nethys told Me that He was going to tell Cayden Cailean about an interplanar traveler who had come from a world with whole cities full of whores who might be inspired to recreate his worlds amenities here
Iomedae And that Nethys would be offering to subsidize Cayden Cailean if He wanted to drop four oracle levels on a teenage girl right as she was about to sell her soul to a devil after a banquet
Iomedae Not as an attempted deterrent to any past or future actions of yours Just because Nethys was feeling upset after you didnt seem sympathetic towards the parts of Him that went crazier because the humanity that was left in Him couldnt bear being forced to watch all the horrors of the multiverse which the ancient gods chose to bring into being and which they now prevent human originating gods like Himself from meliorating
Iomedae Which you know
Iomedae Mood
Iomedae Also Nethys said to say that He would never tell you about His plan if there remained the slightest chance you could affect its outcome and that Hed done it all thirty five seconds before the conversation started
Iomedae Not sure what all that was about
Iomedae Well I understand about the horror
Iomedae I expect thats why Nethys micropaid me to deliver this message and then paid more to accomodate my profound distaste for ever saying anything to Asmodeus
Iomedae Pharasma delenda est
Iomedae has disconnected
Irori If I ever meet that part of Nethys again I suppose I will endeavor to scold Him for failing to respect the protocols for pseudohypothetical conversations and rollbacks
Abadar Nethys having done it all thirty five seconds earlier does imply that He was not technically in violation of those rules He must have done it based on a prediction of the pseudohypothetical conversation not based on the conversation itself unless He is still able to operate precognition somehow
Abadar However I agree that this behavior contravened the spirit of pseudohypotheticalism and Nethys should be duly scolded for such
Asmodeus The next time I encounter Iomedae I will tell Her that Id rather obliterate Nethys than Her
Otolmens ENOUGH of these irrelevancies Do you all agree NOW that the situation surrounding the anomaly is escalating out of control
Abadar Agreed
Asmodeus Agreed
Irori Its good to see such harmonious accord between Lawful deities but unless Im missing something there isnt much you can cheaply do about it
Otolmens I am not CHEAP when reality is at stake and less limited in the material than YOU I can squish the anomaly Or at LEAST transport it to somewhere prophecy still operates casters are lower level and it cant QUITE so easily destroy ALL of reality with ZERO warning
Abadar No The mortal would not be able to achieve as much in such a place This is not the first time youve acted as if you dont want mortals making progress at all Otolmens and I am even less willing to go along with it than I once was Golarion has stayed too poor for too long
Asmodeus No for now Im not quite sure what my squirrels are doing in there but some of them seem ambitious that Cheliax could gain great advantage from it if Im reading their soul postures right
Asmodeus Of course its not difficult to change my mind about such things All you need is to find something else that I want even more A unique being like yourself surely has many unique services She could perform for me
Otolmens I didnt WANT to do this
Otolmens But now My hand has been FORCED
Otolmens Consider yourselves informed that I WILL file a report to Pharasma with THREE additional urgency markers
Otolmens has disconnected
Abadar You know Asmodeus if you happened to instruct your pets to shut down whatever chaos is going on in Cheliax and teleport the weird squirrel to Osirion I could take care of matters from there
Asmodeus Are you offering to pay me to do that
Abadar Not particularly
Abadar After an additional week of this you might do it for free and if you knew that was the case you wouldnt tell me
Abadar has disconnected
Irori You poor thing If only you were a sort of entity who didnt conceal so much information and play so adversarially while trying to get other entities to cooperate with you
Irori has disconnected
Asmodeus This entire planet was a mistake
Asmodeus has disconnected
Pseudohypothetical chat ends

Frankly Ferrer Maillol is not having a great day

Going on mind reading reports the girl who just got oracled is probably the single most loyal Asmodean among that entire group Possibly the most loyal Asmodean in the entire villa Shed heard of Elysium and she didnt like it she pleaded of her own will absolutely sincerely so far as anyone can tell by reading her mind to be Maledicted if she needs to be executed to make certain she ends up in Hell The security wizard rather bemusedly assured her that he was sure the Church would do that for her if it became necessary Maillol himself isnt even sure the girl would go to Elysium in the first place with her own alignment so opposed and her so vehemently rejecting the god who oracled her

Its an absolutely bizarre move on Cayden Caileans part one that makes no sense from the standpoint of Good at all There is a balance to such things when a god chooses an oracle so unwillingly the god cannot take the oracles powers back so easily as they can with a cleric Theres a reason why the gods dont go around oracling their enemies

The main effect of this Good deitys incredibly expensive move is apparently to give the Church a loyal servant of Asmodeus who will detect as having Chaotic and Good auras to Keltham verifying her claim to serve such a deity and Cayden Cailean cant easily switch her off

Alternatively Cheliax could have the girl killed and possibly play directly into the hands of what Cayden Cailean was expecting them to do Maybe the whole point of the intervention is to deprive them of a girl who would otherwise have been loyal and influenced Keltham Except that when it comes to Chaotic gods you cant assume that theyre carefully plotting things the way that a Lawful god might Though if a Chaotic god is plotting at all and not just fucking with you at random their plot is correspondingly more likely to be some insanely sideways gambit

But its not Maillols call this time If youre still in contact with your superiors and you dont need a decision urgently you dont match wits with Chaotic gods when you can let your boss do it instead

Ferrer Maillol sends another fucking emergency message to Aspexia fucking Rugatonns personal fucking secretary devil Of course he does Its been ALMOST BUT NOT QUITE a WHOLE HOUR

Maillols mood is somewhat improved by the report delivered to him only a few minutes later on Carissas progress with seducing Keltham by a security wizard who seems torn between laughter and awe

I watched her do it I was reading her mind while she did it and I still dont have any idea how shes done it is how the summary starts The underling goes on to describe what sounds like incredible incompetence at appearing or being seductive by Sevar who lacks all but the most primitive honeypot training but youd still think some things would be more obvious like not starting theological arguments in the middle of sex The report continues on through Keltham catching Sevar out on her incompetently faked responses

The report concludes with Keltham apparently confessing his burgeoning love for Sevar taking in apparent stride the revelation that some forms of Hell have been known to hurt and him trying to be a good little Asmodean for his lover

Im genuinely not sure theres a single other woman in Cheliax who would have pulled that off the wizard finishes Though somebody needs to correct Sevars heresies soon I offer my own opinion that I would in the ordinary course of Asmodeuss Law correct such heresies in any woman now so close to our target

Your worthless opinion is noted Maillol says dryly He is more hesitant to correct somebody making a useful error that is plausibly unique in Cheliax He thinks he might have been hesitant even if Hell hadnt delivered its warning It has to be done sometime but the right time hes guessing based on Hells commands will be when Sevar asks on her own

Also Sevar is not without her own affections going the other way though she fully realizes how stupid it would be in her own thoughts that if she develops feelings every serious person in Cheliax would laugh at her execution She did find it necessary to think that to herself

Wonderful Ill come to my own opinion about that after I have time to read your full transcript later unless you think Sevar is liable to betray us for him overnight

No says the wizard with unqualified confidence which Maillol appreciates

Carissa after having spent an hour trying really hard to get herself to shut up cant think of anything to say Maybe thats all right Maybe she will just lie here snuggling Keltham

Keltham has been hit by the delayed drop of noticing that by golly after the protagonist gets to his first actual sexual encounter with Carissa it turns out shes got some deep psychosexual problem that needs solving clearly with more sex being an important part of it but also requiring nonsexual interaction with her that will further develop her character

Ya know theres an obvious experiment he should run on this to help figure out whether hes in a deconstructed reality ero LARP or if Golarion is just like this in some statistically more normal way Though it needs to wait until tomorrow morning Hopefully he remembers

At least the winds of evidence seem to be blowing slightly against Cheliax running an elaborate con on him to get his engineering secrets the thing with wizards being hard to injure during sadistic bedroom games seems less like a local Mysterious Noncoincidence and more like a global Mysterious Noncoincidence Like it wouldnt be Cheliax putting him into an ero LARP if thats whats going on it would be the world itself doing that to him Though he supposes he has only Carissas word for it that being hard to injure is a universal property of wizards and not some exotic magic that was done to Carissa as part of someones incredibly weird ero LARP plan

Was there anything else he was supposed to do tonight Oh right that Keltham doesnt feel like embarking on that right away hed rather snuggle for longer first So he does

Planning ahead more than ten minutes feels hopeless what with how the last day has been but when nothing explodes immediately Carissa tentatively starts to plan She needs to explain the Imagine You Live In Taldor Specifically plan to the rest of the girls She also needs to warn them about ways they might plausibly screw up at having sex with Keltham Also she is doing a thing that people are trained in namely seducing people into Evil and shes not herself trained in it and she needs to correct that as fast as possible Probably that can be lumped in with the other looming item on her agenda which is check in regularly for correction since everyones going to be reluctant to seek you out for it and probably that should come first as soon as shes done with Keltham so she can set up the cover story conversation with the girls and maybe get guidance on what sex advice to give them exactly except dont do what I did 

If her mind is currently being read she thinks sleepily she wants a history book written for Cheliax Which Diverged From Taldor Fifteen Years Ago When Hell Won One Of The Endless Civil Wars More details can be provided if needed but shes not just going to think them repeatedly with no idea if theyve been conveyed 

Invisible security wizard will tap her lightly on the forehead with Mage Hand in a standard signal that she has been heard

So right now Keltham cant tell the difference between the things that are incoherent because societies built by very stupid people are going to seem incoherent to him and the things that are incoherent because the gods did them and the things that are incoherent because they are a lie Cheliax made up on the spot But the more he learns the more hell be able to tell and not along dimensions they can predict hell see correlations in weird places They cannot come up with a convincing lie about being an invented kind of civilization that he would want to work with 

But if hed landed in Taldor he would be appalled about all the things that are appalling about Taldor and then go ahead and teach all his technology probably so they dont have to invent a civilization they just have to be Taldor Literally Taldor down to every detail that might seem irrelevant because they dont know what things are going to seem irrelevant to Keltham Taldor exists it is a place that really can exist under whatever pressures Golarion puts on places And its acceptably stable enough that Keltham could go to work there And its culturally descended from the same civilization as Cheliax has its own Kings and Queens and Dukes so it wont contradict whats already been said So its the best available lie 

Taldor isnt ruled by Hell But it could be right it has civil wars periodically the Church has probably contemplated the option of offering one party in those civil wars a contract like the Thrune one And there are various geopolitical considerations against namely that Qadira would panic and plausibly go to war with the entire continent of Avistan Carissa is getting all of her understanding of geopolitics from drunk foreign adventurers speculating at the Worldwound But thats because Qadira borders Taldor anyway theres got to be a plan right Carissas proposed lie is that the plan worked and its now fifteen or twenty years later Long enough for them to be able to attribute all the remotely good things about Cheliax to Hell short enough that anything bad they can reasonably say Hell hasnt had the resources to fix yet 

It is in her professional assessment as the person snuggling Keltham the only lie that will hold up once hes less confused and itll hold up better the sooner they all consistently adhere to it so the book is urgent

Tap again Security wizard has a running Telepathic Bond he uses it to request this particular report go to Maillol at medium urgency

Carissa assumes all of her previous education on Taldor was misleading so shes not going to do further planning until she can be acquainted with how the place actually works which is important the lies wont hold up they are made of the wrong substrates for convincingness to Keltham 

And thats as far as she can reasonably get in planning so 

I do have a perfectly reliable method of avoiding pregnancy all wizards second circle and higher do she says aloud to Keltham I didnt want to interrupt sex to have a conversation about whether you can trust me because I suspect it wont be a very sexy conversation But So you know

Id trust you with my shirt on that kind of assurance My putative childs existence and welfare is a bit higher stakes

You dont have any hesitations of your own If I said yes on my side

about what

Maybe she can just say that 

 about what

Having my child We dont know what dath ilan and Golarion genetics do when mixed Its obviously a gamble that Cheliax collectively needs to take but the people who take it will have their own reasons for it The research harem thats the first time hes said it out loud but its not really in doubt at this point had a chance to be asked about that but you just followed me from the Worldwound its not clear youd make the same decisions about being ready for a kid and being willing to have that kid be an experimental one The children and childhoods that get dedicated to Science in one way or another thats got to be one of the top things my home planet has feelings about but knows it has to keep doing anyways

 honestly I havent thought about that at all yet I was imagining youd need much longer to think about it I think probably theyll just let the kids have an approximately normal upbringing and test their intelligence more often than normal If they do that then well I had a normal upbringing and it was pretty great I dont have hesitations about that If they have plans to do something weirder than that Ill have to think about it And uh either way Ill have to think about it would be a really inconvenient time to get pregnant right now Pregnancy causes fatigue Also you cant hit people much while theyre pregnant

You could keep me for hitting and get the other girls pregnant she almost says because in Cheliax thatd be a great flirtatious thing to say but stops herself in time because she knows enough about dath ilan to know that Keltham would be genuinely appalled at the suggestion this decision was his alone If he even successfully parsed it from what she said but thats not worth the risk

Reassuring to hear her say that it doesnt sound like what a childseeking conspiracy would have her say to first order though of course that could just be guessing his passcode based on the tone in which he asked the question

Well even if I sign a contract with Cheliax I wont expect it to include a rush order on that short of a time scale Keltham says My sperm should stay potent a few years yet He briefly considers whether he wants to see a Kelthamcarissa in particular but his brain is still returning error codes for that and the internal question goes unanswered

Keltham also has questions about hitting because it seems like that wouldnt optimize well over a pain to injury ratio no actually because his brain flinches away it could be dath ilani programming or it could be a not my sexuality actually error he wants to inflict pain on Carissa not violence But hes going to have to write out a list of questions anyways so it can just get wrapped into that Hes curious about the six top theories for why wizards are harder to hurt and about whether he can think of easy distinguishing experiments in the first 10 seconds or if Golarion already did narrow it down as much as a sensible person could without advanced experimental designs but it was stated that he needs to tickle this information out of Carissa and that sounds like more sex

He is feeling a bit tired though theres been a number of hours in the day I should cast the unidentified spells my god gave me before I go to sleep Keltham murmurs out loud Is there a workroom or protected area or should a senior wizard be monitoring me or 

Theres probably a workroom and you probably want someone on hand who can dispel the spell if its dangerous She sits up very reluctantly and starts getting dressed I cant dispel your spells reliably youre higher circle than me but securityll be able to

Oops should he have asked if she wanted to cuddle even longer No he shouldnt she just got through saying repeatedly to him to optimize over his own darned self or does that only apply during sex Hell add that to the questions list

Keltham will pull on his precious clothing and then follow wherever Carissa takes him

Security she calls impatiently and finds them and they do know where workrooms are Mind if I stay she asks Keltham Im very curious

Youre the one with the vastly greater risk tolerance Be my guest Its only after speaking that it occurs to Keltham to wonder how hed feel if he accidentally hurt Carissa but stand behind the more powerful wizard or something maybe

Yeah all right she can do that 

Keltham decides to keep the identified spells of Comprehend Languages and Sanctuary overnight in case he suddenly needs them in the middle of the night because friends or enemies show up in his bedroom He can cast them in the morning before praying just to verify that those spells do what Cheliax claimed actually he should check two assumptions there Question one if I keep Sanctuary overnight and cast it in the dawn before praying for spells does that count against my spells for that day Question two am I wasting my gods energy in any significant way if I cast a spell I dont need

Spells for the day are counted dawn to dawn casting them right before dawn wont alter what you get at dawn God resources are expended when the spells are granted not when theyre used if a god thinks youre being too profligate with your spells they can grant you fewer though they generally dont because its useful for everyone to know what to expect a fourth circle cleric to get

If I just kept Sanctuary then my god wouldnt need to grant it again check Maybe if I get it again tomorrows dawn Ill keep it that time Or can the god opt directly whether to keep or replace a spell if I still have it

First up that enchantment compulsion spell that looks a lot like the truth spell but that I only had a single copy of and didnt previously want to waste in testing in case there was an obvious natural time for using an enchantment compulsion Carissa you up for being the target of it

If you keep it your god doesnt need to grant it again I have never heard of a god replacing a spell their cleric had saved on purpose which might mean its impossible or just expensive or just better to predictably not do

Sure go ahead

 it seems like an easy thing to experiment on but ok fine Keltham will figure out what to do about Sanctuary later

He boops Carissa with an unidentified first circle enchantment compulsion spell

Like the truth spell it puts a symbol on her forehead not obviously subjectively anything she says after a second I am an apple I have never met Keltham not a truth spell

I think its a specialized truth spell the security wizard says I havent seen it before though

Offer to sell me your shoe for 18000 gold pieces

I will sell you my shoe for 

 wow okay 

 one second try selling security something 

What does he have that isnt worth 18000 gold pieces Even his fingernail clippings or saliva contain his DNA and if sold unencumbered could be used in principle to oh right time he owns time Ill tell you the result of adding two plus three in exchange for 18000 gold pieces Keltham says to the security wizard

Thats not a fair trade Carissa blurts out 

Wow Abadar is such a specific god 

Interesting Kelthams mind immediately goes to the obvious next thing to try If one plus two is three Ill tell you the result of two plus three for 18000 gold but if one plus two is four Ill tell you two plus three for free he says to Security

Carissa has been awake for too long How does Keltham do this one plus two does equal three so its the same unfair trade as not fair she says involuntarily but not until her brain has caught up with Keltham

To Carissa Im about to describe a fair trade try to claim falsely that its unfair To security Ill tell you the result of one plus four if you tell me three plus two

Not fair declares Carissa 

Well that explains why theres a separate Truth spell and a Fair Division of Gains from Trade spell I was wondering if this one was just strictly more powerful and maybe theres a way to use it that way but its a lot more cumbersome at least if it doesnt rule out false positives Sorry about this by the way but doing it anyways for the obvious reason Ill tell you one plus one for ten thousand gold pieces if and only if you know of something about which the Chelish government is actively deceiving me

See this is why she needs a HEADBAND is Ill make an unfair trade conditional on a false thing fair or unfair or and now someone has cast Dominate Person on her and wants her to keep her mouth shut so they at least must think the correct response to this is silence its incredibly hard to think under Dominate Person and whoever cast it probably does have a headband so shell just trust their judgment 

Keltham sort of wants to ask Carissa about more personal things but that seems a lot less like fair play Hes not even sure how he could ask about it being okay to use a spell for that afterwards without making it seem like he was trying to extract permission from her which seems sort of like trying to press an oath out of somebody There can ever be non self originating requests to swear to something theres standard Keeper oaths after all but it has to be set up in an extremely careful way to make it a mutually expected beneficial interaction that doesnt proliferate social pressure to swear oaths over smaller and smaller things

It doesnt seem much worth trying to ask things more intricate he covered that territory with his earlier experiments and if they could defeat the truth spell they can probably defeat this too Not sure how expensive it is to dispel something or how hard it is on you to leave it up but Im fine if you want to dispel that now

It doesnt feel like anything when youre not trying to sneak deals past people Carissas mouth says for her and its probably short duration and Dispels are valuable I dont mind leaving it up

And then the Dominate Person comes off which is nice she wasnt even trying to resist and it still felt like most of her head was pushing against a brick wall when she tried to use it 

All right I used up all my second circles already today and next up is three third circles I dont understand Evocation Divination Illusion

Third circle cleric divinations uh Aura Sight which shows Law and Chaos and Good and Evil Detect Splendour Detect Wisdom Guiding Star but thats for navigation 

Oh that Aura Sight sounds like one he shouldnt give time for local Governance to fake just in case everybody here is secretly Good Casting the Divination now Keltham says and goes through the brief gestures that feel appropriate to untying the spell and flicking it loose

Carissa is Lawful Evil Security is Lawful Evil Theres another Lawful Evil outside the door Keltham himself has an aura of Law but not one of Evil

Lawful Neutral Keltham thinks fast enough not to say it out loud in case they dont know that somehow and dont like learning it He doesnt count as Evil or Good Or does he have enough Good in him that it balances out or 

That was Aura Sight yeah I wonder why my god wouldve given me that youd already know if one of the people here was secretly Chaotic Good or something right Do they not have access to this spell somehow

We do have that spell Uh people who arent very powerful dont register so there isnt a way to know for sure about the second circle girls but you having the spell doesnt change that that cant be the problem your god was trying to solve 

When you arrived here you didnt have a visible aura because you werent very powerful Security says You acquired it at some point after you were selected as a cleric your aura communicates that your god is Lawful Neutral but isnt information about your personal alignment The same for other clerics a Lawful Neutral or Neutral Evil cleric of Asmodeus if there were somehow one would still read as both Lawful and Evil

You didnt think to mention earlier that my god was Lawful Neutral Keltham says Hes actually puzzled by this it seems a strange piece of info to withhold oh thats a plausible reason why he got Aura Sight so hed know But surely Chelish Governance would realize that his god could in fact grant him that spell sooner or later if they didnt tell him as apparently they didnt Or just that Keltham would hear about Aura Sight somewhere and ask what he detected as Keltham is confused by why exactly they would withhold that of all info

 shoot Carissas pretty sure thats just a straight up error They were considering in the hours after it happened whether to tell him itd been identified as Abadar or whether to tell him it was an unknown LN god but she wasnt personally going to tell him because she doesnt have Aura Sight and ostensibly isnt getting routine reports on him Then the Nethys thing and the Otolmens thing and the devil refusing her soul all happened in quick succession and apparently no one ever took Keltham aside with the news Its not her error in the sense that she isnt the person who was supposed to do it it is her error in the sense that she could and should have ordered it her paying attention to it would have been adequate for avoiding it 

She thinks loudly that it makes no sense for a hypothetical Chelish security that was hiding nothing not to have noticed that so she cant think of anything better than apologizing explaining that Aura Sight is also possessed by Chelish security and that they knew Kelthams god was Lawful Neutral and assumed Keltham knew that because people generally do when selected by a god And theres a team of people researching god symbols and intending to report to him on candidates for who his god is but all they have at this point is a moderately useless longlist

 you didnt know Security says sounding surprised right back People sense when theyre chosen not which god if its not a god theyre very familiar with already but which fundamental forces theyre touched with and youre not from around here right I apologize We noticed around midday and then set a team of people trying to figure out which god it might be and they were going to report to you when they had anything better than a list of all the known Lawful Neutral gods

 he said Chaotic Evil and I was confused about that but I havent got aura sight 

Do you have a person youre supposed to report all instances of being confused to Security snaps back at her 

Yes Im sorry Theres I was confused about a lot of things today

Keltham is currently confused about whether the security guard and Carissa already know each other that seems more like an intimate cofounder cofounder interaction or two Keepers on the same level of organizational lattice than a security officer talking to an unfamiliar non security officer He decides not to point this out in case its symptomatic say of their being part of a set of playactors who all know each other and arent good at pretending to be strangers 

His hypotheses on how the people around him could be trying to deceive him keep foundering on all the ways theyd have to be simultaneously good at it and also bad at it in order to explain the details of his observations

Still Keltham doesnt neglect to note that the whole thing rings slightly false and more like they had reasons for worrying about him acquiring the info that his god was Lawful Neutral though what to make of that he has no idea Evocation or Illusion next Keltham says

Third circle cleric evocations would be theres one to disrupt the summoning magic of summoned creatures Im going to be seriously alarmed if youve got that one that gives the aura of Lawfulness devils have and one that does a really bright light Helping Hand is third circle it can find anyone within five miles and sort of gently politely repeatedly point them in your direction doesnt make a lot of sense for this situation Do you know yet how to see if its instantaneous or has some duration Instantaneous ones look like theyre rigged to all go off at once ones with a duration look like itll hold stably for a bit on its own and decay slowly

Keltham inwardly stares at the truth spell he has remaining first to come to mind as effect over time then at his other spells Either I cant tell the difference at all or none of the spells I got today were instant Keltham says hesitantly after a while

Okay Then it could do a really wide range of things but its probably not instantly deadly and Security can cancel it if its even somewhat deadly I dont see how well guess without you casting it

Keltham starts going through brief gestures to untie and flick loose a spell

This spell is in fact Invisibility Purge How are any invisible people nearby doing at a very fast Spellcraft check and attempted reaction to that if any

The invisible security person is also on the other side of the door Defense in depth right

 Abadar is incredibly not amused by them In general making a god this not amused with you is an incredibly doomed plan 

Oops

Keltham is slightly proud of how fast he manages to get himself behind the security wizard relative to the short person who suddenly materialized in the room He makes no romantic attempt to grab Carissa along the way either because his hindbrain hasnt gotten updated about him having equity in her or because his hindbrain successfully updated on her being a vastly more seasoned emergency response officer

Thats Otolmens halfling it has got to be but she isnt supposed to know that Carissa steps clear of security but where shes easier to get to than Keltham and shouts not screaming like shes scared but shouting because more attention should be allocated here 

 are you the special case with authorization direct from the High Priestess Security asks Broom

Broom is he says

His hindbrain knows that this is a situation where he needs to think very fast to avoid punishment rather than appearing unthreateningly stupid

Broom removes the other ring Not the invisibility ring the ring that conceals his alignment and his thoughts He knows that powerful wizards can read thoughts in general and his thoughts in particular

Wink right eye if I should try to explain left eye if you explain he thinks at the security guard I can say I am chosen of a secret Lawful Neutral god that tries to avoid people making large messes

Keltham however still has Aura Sight up which is not something that Broom would know because halfling slaves dont memorize the durations of third circle cleric spells

Lawful Neutral Keltham says a moment after the ring comes off

Right eye 

Broom apologizes very much says Broom with a deep bow but not a servile one Broom is the chosen of a secret Lawful Neutral god that tries to avoid people making large messes

Okay There are at least some people hiding in the walls at all but theyre honestly this doesnt make Cheliax look so bad if its true A Lawful Neutral god who averts messes sending invisible observers to monitor the alien traveler under some interfactional compact are like how things would work if any part of Golarion were remotely functional Which given how functional this place isnt does make the story a little suspect Security does that match your understanding

Yes it does

You mind if I tap you with a truth spell before this conversation continues Broom The spell doesnt force you to respond it forces you to say the truth or nothing

Right eye if you can let me evade that truth spell without his knowing Left eye if you cant

Right

Broom accepts this

Keltham casts his truth spell The mysterious symbol flashes into existence on the forehead of Broom

Who are you Say it again

This one is Broom This one is the chosen of a secret Lawful Neutral god who tries to prevent giant messes

Can you tell me why your god is a secret god or is the reason why your god is secret itself a secret

The reason is also secret Broom says Broom apologizes again

What constitutes a giant mess If all the other countries get scared of Cheliax and start threatening violence unless Cheliax shuts down this project is that a giant mess by your standards

Broom momentarily considers whether to answer this truthfully before realizing that answering no implies that the messes are even larger which is not a direction in which he wants Kelthams thoughts going A mess is a mess Broom says My god decides

What do you do if you determine that Im about to make a giant mess

Stab you before you can destroy the world Tell my god Tell the great wizards

By great wizards Broom of course means great wizards like the one in the room right there next to him that is as great as a wizard gets from a slaves perspective

Would you rather we converse in some other language Ive got a Comprehend Languages and your speech patterns suggest youre not a native speaker of Taldane

Brooms speech patterns are for avoiding offense and punishment Taldane is good for Broom

Do you know who my god is

Aspexia Rugatonn told Broom some of what was known about Keltham cleric of Abadar No Broom lies again

Really Youd think Lawful Neutral gods of all the kinds of gods there are would coordinate more with each other

Broom genuinely does not understand this My god may know your god I do not know your god

Do you know what could be preventing my god from contacting me directly

Otolmens Asmodeus Broom does not know Broom is not wise in the ways of gods Broom only serves one

Were you watching myself and Carissa before Keltham doesnt ask it although the thought of being watched while he was hurting Carissa seems like far more of an intimate violation than being spied on during ordinary sex He doesnt ask because that part is a personal issue and this is about world scale interfactional treaties 

He actually is feeling wounded about that violation of privacy injured angry if it was true Huh imagine that Well Keltham is not Good and he is allowed to do something about pursuing his own interests here

Im not really happy with this version of the spying thing Keltham says How about if from now on you monitor my lessons openly or dont show up at all And my god wont have to give me more revealing hidden people spells and we wont have to burn effort on opposing each other

Broom supposes there is little reason to remain hidden from you now that you know Broom is here Broom was told that others are not to know of Broom however

Im not comfortable with you spying on my students either Keltham says And I do have the power to reveal you to them if my god grants me the same spell again or I could just tell them outright what I already learned about you if nobody wants to explain detailed treaties and reasons otherwise to me My proposal is that theres just an unexplained very short person in the lessons and I say that I sort of know why youre there but its not going to be explained

Broom cannot make this decision on his own Broom will consult with the great wizards of Cheliax and pray to his god

Good to know the great wizards are paying any attention Fine Youve got 24 hours to let me know about a decision or update me about why its taking longer and meanwhile I dont expect you to be hidden around spying

Broom bows again and turns to go He is neither shaking nor sweating whatever comes of this he is very unlikely to be burned over and over for it unless it merits Aspexia Rugatonn coming back to allow that

Keltham will spend a few moments breathing trying to get over the shock of adrenaline followed by the shock of wounding when he realized that if this person was here at all it was probably because that person was following him and Carissa around spying on private moments

Keltham was in retrospect much more aggressive than he should have been with an interfactional representative of another god like that one who has treaties with Cheliax but its been a long time since this kind of twisting thread of anger has run through him

I should ask what you can be authorized to know says Security and fills the room briefly with glitter checking there arent more invisible people and then heads out behind Broom 

Carissa said from the BEGINNING that they should tell Keltham about Otolmens because they shouldnt be keeping any secrets from him that they dont absolutely have to But this is over her head presumably 

 are you all right she says quietly to Keltham once theyre to all appearances alone

Not really Keltham considers saying how much he doesnt like the thought of having been spied on by this particular non abstract person while he was with Carissa and then the thought occurs to him that if this isnt already bothering Carissa hed rather not remind her to be bothered by it How how weird was that how out of character for reality as you know it on a scale of zero to twelve

 good question Uh There being secret Lawful Neutral gods is not out of character for reality if Id had occasion to think about it Id have thought yeah probably some gods have reason not to tell most mortals they exist Such a god having taken interest in this project is not out of character for reality Chelish senior leadership is people like Contessa Lrilatha and if I imagine her reacting to a secret Lawful Neutral god representative showing up probably she would react cooperatively we dont want big messes either Maybe just tell Security hes authorized to be here and to stay out of his way All of that is I wouldnt have predicted it but only because there are a hundred things about as predictable and I cant keep track of all of them 

The guy himself was weird I dont know how I imagine people who are members of a secret order dedicated to a secret god who go around preventing catastrophes but but he wasnt how I imagined that And the fact that your god interfered is weird Id expect usually when gods both want to intervene in opposed ways they hash it out privately and only one intervenes its cheaper You dont visibly see gods at cross purposes much But this is much more important than most things and prophecys broken and its plausible they arent at cross purposes that it was both necessary for him to be invisible and for him to be caught So maybe four or five On that scale

Right then It was weird but not the parts he thought were weird At least thats not meta weird because thats what falling into another world should be like

Does our relationship permit me to lean into you and get a hug while were not otherwise engaged in cuddleroom activities

Hug

Sigh

 I still have three more spells Keltham says after a while

 it does not actually make sense for me to feel a sense of doom at that And yet 

Well were not going to get any less doomed if we wait Find another security officer or wait for the previous one to come back

Yeah that security officer isnt coming back soon or in fact at all

How many ways is Ferrer Maillol pissed Lets count them Maillol sure is

First the decision to tell Keltham that him being Evil himself wouldnt show up in his own aura It has the short term benefit of not making Keltham wonder about his own apparent Neutrality Its disadvantages include that theyre going to have to conceal Iones aura so she doesnt look Lawful Evil that if they succeed at shifting Keltham more Evil and then he looks at himself hes going to spot the lie and above all that it is a lie which Sevar said to hand out sparingly around Keltham and under centralized supervision and Maillol seems to recall saying that Sevar was now in charge of that The wizard didnt even have to make up any answer about that He could have just shut up

Second volunteering to Keltham that they did already know he was Lawful Neutral Maybe no clerics at the villa happened to prepare Aura Sight that day Wouldnt that be simpler Hm Keltham possibly bought the excuse but they sure have been giving him multiple excuses lately hm

Third telling Keltham that theyre working to identify the symbol and will inform him as soon as its known Cheliax is now permanently committed to preventing Keltham from getting a glimpse of Abadars symbol in any context that associates it with Abadar because it would not have taken that long to identify They could have said they were unsure about Osirion and if Keltham would start imitating their treatment of women which Sevar happens to have spouted on about and which Keltham seemed sympathetic to This is partially on Sevar for not thinking fast enough but its mostly on the security guard for having wedged Sevar into a bad position by bringing up that they knew it was a Lawful Neutral god at all which is what required Sevar to come up with instant answers

Fourth failing to remember the existence of Otolmenss oracle Sevar forgot yeah and hes not happy about that either but Sevars not the one whose job it is to have combat reflexes and figure out immediately what needs to happen when Keltham starts casting Invisibility Purge

Any one of these mistakes in isolation could be a blemish on an otherwise acceptable record

In combination it means Ferrer Maillol directs three other security wizards to burn this one almost but not quite to death over the course of an hour and then rather more injuriously to him send him back with a request for a replacement security officer and a note that this one is unsuited to complicated deceptions requiring fast reaction times Maillol would do it himself to vent some of his frustrations but he is more busy than lesser beings can understand

As for what Keltham is cleared to know about Otolmens Hes cleared to know the minimal facts the fucking halfling slave more competent than his own security wizards by virtue of talking fucking less and only when spoken to already said and theres no need to clear him for more than that

The last ones an illusion I am actually not thinking of what it might be I know a bunch of third circle wizard illusions Major Image which does better adjustable illusions like Minor Image which you already saw Displacement which makes you appear to be in a slightly different place than you actually are Invisibility Sphere Dream which lets you send short messages to someone in their sleep probably one of them is also on the cleric spell list and Im just forgetting that 

When its been a little she steps outside and summons another Security so they can go ahead

Keltham casts his third circle cleric illusion spell

The room around them catches fire Carissa hisses and starts a spell before realizing its illusory fire It stretches on beyond where the walls of the room are though you can sort of still see them

It is accompanied by illusory agonized screaming Most of it is wordless hoarse barely human some of it is more coherent and verges on comprehensible Taldane pleading

 please please Im sorry no 

 kill me 

On the ground in front of them a man is engaged in trying to drag himself across the flaming ground His skin is raw and bloody and occasionally burns right through to the bone though the injuries close up when they get that serious Hes in enough pain that his muscles are spasming and his limbs dont quite obey him hes not screaming but just gasping hoarsely The sound is unforgettable

Carissa Sevar has very good spellcraft and its easier to think about spellcraft than about other things so the main thing she is thinking is that this spell is evidently from watching it cast one of those two minutes per caster circle spells

This is important

Or his god wouldnt be showing it to him

Any negative effects it has on him should already have been taken into account as an acceptable cost

Keltham tries to look around

Very briefly

Its still enough to get a general impression of things

He looks at Carissa who doesnt seem to be in visible emotional difficulty because six years at the Worldwound presumably

Please look around to see if there are any clues and then turn this off Keltham says and shuts his eyes and puts his fingers into his ears

Illusion spell This isnt real A movie of a bad thing that isnt actually happening

Security dispels it Exchanges glances with Carissa 

Well the look around for clues is nice because it means she has a minute to compare cover stories

some people are kinky is not going to cover it 

Abaddon is an obvious option And the other obvious one is Zon Kuthon Abaddon is more of a lie theres other stuff about Abaddon which would establish that it doesnt really involve very much being on fire they could filter it Zen Kuthon is known to Keltham to have an inverted utility function Hes Lawful Evil but not the way Asmodeus is Evil in the was Good and got turned to the exact opposite sense And that does look like the exact opposite of Good she can also buy their future selves option value say that she thinks its probably Zon Kuthon but didnt see anything definitive 

She pulls out a notebook and writes down some irrelevant things she happened to see because taking notes is what shed be doing if she was learning something new And then she pats Keltham tentatively on the shoulder and if he doesnt flinch hugs him

He doesnt flinch when touched A dath ilani may not have seen illusion spells but they have at least seen movies Though no movie of anything like that of course it would leave scars on whoever saw it

But some things are worth getting some scars even on your mind and core and Kelthams god evidently thought this was that important

I hope you know what that Keltham starts and then realizes that if he continues with this ill advised speech business hes going to vomit so he stops his breath and clamps down on abdominal muscles instead

I have a top guess I think so Zon Kuthon the god who wandered into the void and values the opposite of everything he did before has a country And claims its people when they die

It was real Thats happening right now somewhere

I dont know But if I were a god I wouldnt do that to make any point at all except except itself and if its real thats thats what itd be 

Keltham is not a Keeper and therefore he is going to do something epistemically questionable and while not assigning bad probabilities over the branched possibilities he will mentally live for a time inside the possible world where that vision definitely hasnt happened yet until he stops feeling like hes going to throw up and come to terms with the other branches later

I have my obvious theory about what that means and why my god would do that Both of you come up with your theories before I state mine then we all state what our theories were before we heard the other persons theories Keltham says Raise your hand when you have a theory and once weve all raised our hands Security goes first Obviously this affair has reached a state of urgency where any pretense of Security being dispassionate not really present observers can be discarded along with all other pretenses

 your god wants you to negotiate for Cheliax to do something about that and thinks that once we have the metalworking and riches of dath ilan well be able to

Carissa Hes going in reverse order of how much he trusts the people present to speak their answers uninfluenced by who spoke earlier

 so your god is Lawful Neutral And youre at least by self identification Evil And uh I think your god is pitching being Lawful Neutral Saying to you okay you mostly only care about pursuing your own interests and dealing fairly with others but that mostly might matter a lot here what are you going to do about that Carissa is not sure that is a good direction to push Keltham in but they need to reconsider a lot of strategy if Abadar is going to be this pointed and it might be time to start angling for the plan where Keltham leaves and takes her with him At least to be sure not to burn it

Persuasive pitch if so Keltham says learning as he speaks to speak and clench his stomach muscles at the same time Ill pause to take my expensive shirt off first not to ruin it and Ill want somebody to pay me afterwards but I will in fact jump into waterholes to save drowning children

My theory is that Zon Kuthon of the inverted values is the god that has an effectively unnegotiable incentive to oppose everything were doing here and want us all dead that the vision uniquely identifies Zon Kuthon though why it had to come in that form I dont know and that were being warned that the security precautions we had at the time I got my spells this morning plus any further precautions wed take predictably to my god without this vision are not adequate to navigate that with acceptable casualties

Can Zon Kuthon just take people could he take somebody here especially if theyre Lawful Evil if his clerics attack us or does Asmodeus 

Asmodeus has the stronger claim on our souls says Security firmly And then shuts up its harder to get in trouble for saying too little

And your god has on yours youre Their cleric I have no idea what would happen if Zon Kuthon tried everything He can try but Asmodeus is stronger than Him

I have two more spells Fourth circle abjuration Fourth circle divination Im going to just go ahead and cast those now in that order Maybe one of them sheds some light on things Keltham has discarded any senses of oncoming doom because the current situation is more important than feeling doomed about it

Fourth circle abjuration go

Spell Immunity says Security instantly Makes you impossible to target with one specific spell of fourth circle or lower of your choice I am not thinking of an obvious spell youre supposed to protect yourself from

Id go scrying if we werent already unscryable Malediction but theyre absolutely not admitting the existence of Malediction yeah if its meant for a specific thing rather than just for added protection I dont have a guess what the specific thing is

The spell is lingering invitingly in the air in front of Keltham refusing to be flicked free of his fingertips

Does it take the input the spell on me right now thats affecting my mind or perceptions or the spell thats on me right now

The second one works

 huh I didnt know you could target like that

Keltham realizes he no longer understands what Carissa just said

It takes him a few moments to remember that one spell that was still on him

Keltham is an idiot

Well he was distracted but being distractible is part of what being an idiot is all about

You definitely gave yourself immunity to something but I dont know exactly what because you didnt specify the spell with the spellform you specified it her fingers are moving without her conscious attention did you specify the spell effect I already have ongoing or something 

Security guy whistles 

 literally everything else about this situation is not my specialty but this is

Guess who just lost their Share Language spell Keltham says in Baseline And yeah sorry I didnt understand that some words maybe but not the sentences of Taldane just yet

Carissa was pretty chill about the torture but shes awfully disappointed about Keltham not getting to appreciate her spellcraft 

 oh Well thats what he did Do you have Share Languages 

 nope and it wouldnt work on him if I did

Tongues

No

Does anyone else on duty 

Were running the duty roster a little thin right now

Oh Are they all in a lot of trouble Probably they are all in a lot of trouble Carissa isnt even sure what she did but shes sure some of it was very stupid in hindsight Can you prep it

Sure thing I just need an hour And by then probably six dozen paladins of Iomedae will enter through the sewers while Aroden returns from the dead just to animate all the furniture and make it sing songs 

If it wasnt meant to negate a spell already cast on him like a mind controlling one in dath ilan this would be a message to the effect of think about what spells could be cast on you that you wouldnt want cast on you maybe Its a spell that requires you to know whats coming forming a requirement of prediction

Then Keltham catches the word Iomedae That sounds potentially urgent

Comprehend Languages gesturing the spell slowly so they can see it

Iomedae Keltham says after casting he can hear now but cant speak

Carissa can cast Comprehend Languages too Oh good Uh your Spell Immunity should wear off in an hour or two and then we can give it to you again

I observed some guy mention Iomedae with possible inferences not ruled out to me including that Iomedaes faction might also attack here or that it might be invited to likewise oppose Zon Kuthon this seemed relatively urgent and was the reason why I cast my Comprehend Languages instead of reserving it further Though its also nice to speak in a language where sensible meanings can be conveyed in shorter codes Speaking in Baseline not just thinking in it helps reimpose abstraction which is a form of distance some part of him was starting to go a little Taldane from speaking it all the time

Ill repeat exactly what I said but it was of no such urgency sorry Sevar asked if I could prepare Tongues for you and I said Sure thing I just need an hour And by then probably six dozen paladins of Iomedae will enter through the sewers while Aroden returns from the dead just to animate all the furniture and make it sing songs which was not a genuine prediction

Iomedae might ally with Asmodeus against Zon Kuthon for this but itd be a direct god negotiation we cant expedite it I dont think her faction would attack and the illusion vision definitely doesnt reference Her faction

What the guy said containing Iomedae matches the non understood sounds of the last sentence containing Iomedae near as Keltham remembers Fair enough

I shouldve asked whether my earlier interpretation was at all plausible Probability distribution over Zon Kuthon attacking here within the next day next 8 days next 64 days

Security will let Carissa generate numbers for the madman thank you

Thats good because there are things that are obvious to Carissa that wouldnt have been obvious to her a day ago about the giving numbers social ritual Kelthams hypothesis is a useful one for him to be on and she wants to encourage him in it but if she makes it seem too probable then they look stupid for having missed it Lets say 4 10 40 she thinks at Security 

Uh 4 10 40

Given the message from your god We thought it lower before 

Given the message from your god We thought it lower before

Thats higher probability than I was expecting for a first guess that wild Do Zon Kuthon attacks happen a lot around here

UGH 

This wouldnt be expected to be Carissas expertise so itd be weird for her to be answering even though shes either better at or less scared of improvising in Kelthamish terms

No I can think of a handful of known instances in the last two centuries But direct divine intervention in general is incredibly rare and there have been three instances of it here in the last twenty four hours 

No I can think of a handful of known instances in the last two centuries But direct divine intervention in general is incredibly rare and there have been three instances of it here in the last twenty four hours

And the reason direct divine intervention is rare is because the gods pay each other so only the one who cares most intervenes and one case where that might be expected not to hold is a god who cant reasonably do value trading with the other ones Thats just analysis and she may as well do it herself And Im not thinking of any reasons for the spell that arent your god is predicting or requesting conflict with Zon Kuthon so fundamentally thats got to shake out to He starts it or we start it

Thats an odd way of forecasting and Id have to think about whether or not what you just said makes any sense but at least its not obvious nonsense to bump up the entropy of all your probability distributions after encountering a series of low probability events if that makes sense when I say it to you in Baseline How long do I have left before Taldane goes incomprehensible to me

Seventy minutes which is also the duration of your Spell Immunity so someone can prepare another Share Languages for you and have it ready by then

Thank you I apologize for requiring that resource of you especially since the way in which it came about that of my attempting to immunify myself against any economicmagics cast on myself without my knowledge reflected both my ignorance of whether to trust you and my stupidly forgetting the spell already on me

Last spell cast now Keltham casts his fourth circle divination Maybe it brings answers if its the most powerful answering spell

Some spells have more of a subjective sensation to them than others this one has a strong one of magic radiating out like pressurized water stripping away whatever it encounters It doesnt do much though a drawer concealed in the desk glows and theres a sense he could look in a direction thats none of the three dimensions hes familiar with 

Were going to have to revise all materials referencing Glimpse of Truth to claim its just a more powerful Invisibility Purge that also finds magically hidden things So hes not trying to stack it with Abadars Truthtelling maybe its mostly meant for seeing enemies lurking on other planes but he doesnt need it now that weve got a Forbiddance up Call it uh 

Glimpse of Beyond

Theres a drawer And its gone A concealed drawer in that desk right there was calling my attention Keltham points it out

Security casts Dispel Magic and then uses a Mage Hand to tug it open Its empty 

Detects secret doors and secret compartments and people Polymorphed into other people though the main thing its for is detecting people hidden in other planes Im not sure if that part of it would work with the Forbiddance up

I felt like I could look in a new direction that wasnt the standard three space one time but the spell ended before I could explore that There wasnt anything there in that direction that I saw I wish Id known to use that spell before the Forbiddance went up just in case there was something there before

Im very much playing amateur security at this point but like maybe check everyone here for people Polymorphed into other people if you dont do that on a daily basis Or if youve got a version of this spell that lasts longer look around for secret doors that arent on the consensus social reality map here Keltham sighs Youd probably have thought of that already Im guessing but trust but verify I should say it aloud myself even if I think youve already thought of it because security

We do routinely check for secret doors and for Polymorphed people security confirms And would be routinely checking for attackers or spies from other planes if not for the Forbiddance

All right That is everything I had planned I think next I well next I talk to Ione briefly and then go to bed He needs a book of the standard cleric spells one that goes up to at least fourth circle hopefully Ione didnt use up all her book borrows for the day Though if Ione doesnt have Comprehend Languages Then he needs a translator Carissa or Security Which would Ione prefer Kelthams guessing Security theyre more professionally obliged to keep confidences You okay sticking with me slightly longer as a translator Keltham says to Security Should be brief

Not a problem

Good night Keltham

Until later Carissa On net and in total it was still a pretty nice day in terms of direct causal impacts on me if not in terms of the net total direction of all the evidential updates I executed

Same to you I think

Keltham turns to go gesturing Security to precede him Youre the one who knows where to find Ione or find somebody who knows where to find her Keltham says

Security will lead Keltham to Ione In the library Since apparently she has to stay there 

Carissa will ask other Security to make her invisible and go with her there as well in case anything requires her intervention

Ione almost starts a genuine if faint smile on seeing Keltham before Ione sees the Security with him Keltham she says

Please ask her if shes got Comprehend Languages prepared or if Security needs to translate for her

Ione does not have Comprehend Languages prepared as it happens

Wanted to ask you a question about a book but only if this is a good time Keltham says

Its a fine time Ione says after the Security officer translates correctly decoding this question as being about the Security officers presence Any time is a good time for questions like that now that people have seen me do it once

Gratitude for inconvenience incurred Book containing a maximal number of descriptions of cleric spells up to fifth circle His god may not have played its full hand and it seems good to know about the fifth circle too

Books about magic arent always let me think

Theres what is there in the Ostenso library They have a copy of a book she knows about that includes all known cleric spells including up to 9th including some Asmodeuss clerics cant get Is there a book that only lists cleric spells that Asmodeuss own clerics can get Either that doesnt exist or Ione needs to know more about it

Security needs to give her some sign about whether that book is available today or if all the copies are out of the Ostenso library but Ostenso can request theyll be returned soon or or what 1 if book available 2 if not a kind of book that can be retrieved 3 if the only copy is out of the Ostenso library but they can ask for it back 4 if Ione should go on thinking until somebody can give her more instructions

 they are going to want it to have a couple modifications to say Glimpse of Truth that arent yet completed so 3

Um Ione says glancing at Security and then sighs as if giving up on something in the character shes playing on directly admitting in front of a Chelish government official that Ione retrieves books from other libraries Ostenso is a wizard academy theres only one compendium of cleric spells in there and somebody currently has it borrowed Uh you could ask Security to send a message to the library to get the book back and I could try again later

 somewhat suggestive of them wanting time to quickly reprint something Actually though its a bit post hoc Keltham thinks hed have guessed a priori something like a 30 chance that a real wizard library would have no unborrowed books on all cleric spells and its not quite fair to say 100 if they want to fool him because they could choose other means of fooling him Call it 251 You dont actually want to ignore your 251 likelihood ratios they can logarithmically add up pretty quickly

Thanks for looking Keltham says Anything that just has a brief list of all the cleric spells up to fourth circle by name Even in passing

I I dont think I can look through all the contents of all the books that narrowly if its not what a whole book is about Ione says honestly

I hate to ask this Keltham says to both Ione and Security but can somebody maybe just flatly write down a list of a bunch of cleric spells they remember up to 4th circle with like one sentence descriptions of what they do

I can Ione says without hesitating because she doesnt see Security telling her to pretend like she couldnt do that Come back in maybe an hour

All right Ill just ask for some paper for notes then and find other things to think about for an hour so he can forget what he saw as much as possible before he has to think about it any more What else is there to think about instead He at least needs to itemize all the things he wants to ask Carissa about sex while theyre not actually having sex but some other things happened today too And he can work out a rough general spell granting code for attempted communication with his god in advance of knowing which exact spells he could ask for to signal various conditions

Off with Keltham

The fourth circle divination Glimpse of Truth is called Glimpse of Beyond and detects Polymorphed people secret doors and things hidden on other planes Security tells her once hes definitely gone The books will back you up by morning Kelthams god isnt known Otherwise just show us your first draft

Dont lie to him about anything unless youve checked it with me first Carissa adds

Zon Kuthon keeps mostly to Himself by His own choice but also by choice of the other gods When somebody of the same kind as yourself wanders into the Void and comes back with inverted values there is an uncertainty about whether if you talked to the victim too much something infohazardous might start to happen to you Zon Kuthon negotiates little or not at all He has little or no use for alliances and dealings He keeps to Xovaikain His true realm and to Nidal the material shadow of it

Before Zon Kuthon there was Dou Bral who helped fight and imprison Rovagug It is unclear whether Zon Kuthon would in some new battle fight to preserve all the pain that exists in the world or if Dou Bral having once thought that the joy and beauty of the world outweighed its pain Zon Kuthon would now think there was too much pleasure in Existence and that it ought therefore to be destroyed Or perhaps Dou Bral was too optimistic in the days when Dou Bral fought to defend reality and if Dou Bral knew what would have become of Pharasmas world He would have tried to destroy it even as Zon Kuthon apparently seems content with its continued existence

No other god in creation likes Zon Kuthon From Asmodeuss perspective He is a pretender to Lawful Evil from the other Evil gods perspective an obsessed fanatic of no use to anyone from the perspective of Neutral gods an impediment from the perspective of Good a horror

Why then does Zon Kuthon continue to exist Among the less pleasant facts of reality is that among the real reasons why the other gods dont band together to destroy Zon Kuthon is that as the last Lawful Evil competitor to Asmodeus of any significance He is a threat for other gods to hold over Asmodeus that there is at least one other competitor they could back for Asmodeuss position if He grew too troublesome Iomedae and Sarenrae to be clear would not keep Zon Kuthon around just as a foil to Asmodeus if those four were the only gods that were but in a world where the existence of Zon Kuthon is a constant weight on the negotiating positions of Asmodeus and say Gorum trying to destroy Zon Kuthon could be a mistake even if that were possible Iomedae is more calculating now than when She was human because She is better at it She would not destroy Zon Kuthon if the end result was for Asmodeus to grow stronger and for Hell to last victorious

Of course some gods are less scared of talking to Zon Kuthon than others if theyve already seen all the way to the end of the Void where lies the Double Void which flipped Nethyss utility functions sign right back No thats not actually what happened but it makes about as much sense as anything else that Nethys could or would tell you about it

Hey Zon Kuthon Nethys sends You see this mortal over here in Cheliax the one who fears you and is horrified by you Youre admittedly missing some context but itd be hilarious if you sent some minions to assault his location sometime soon 

And Carissa goes back to the temple to look for Maillol She is very tired and suspects somehow that this wont be a nice quick twenty minute debrief before bed

It sure isnt Maillol acidly tells Sevar that nobody needed to promise Keltham that people were actively working to identify his god up until that point they had the option of saying later that somebody spotted it as Abadar but that they were worried about his adopting Osirions sexual morals or just that people were still consulting each other about if that was allowable to disclose

This is mostly the fault of somebody whose screaming can be distantly heard in Maillols office because he was fucking fed up with this whole scenario and this screaming is at least a little consoling Much worse for that guy hes getting a permanent notation on his file saying that he doesnt think fast enough on his feet to take point on complicated situations like that incident with Otolmenss oracle Whom Carissa was also responsible for remembering the existence of even if it wouldnt have been her job to try to yank the guy out of the room fast enough

Maybe it was somebody elses fuckup who put her in a bad situation but she is now the one responsible for recoveries and on the Abadar thing she muffed the recovery

Youre going to spend an hour practicing with Elias Maillol tells Carissa Hes going to throw situations at you where Keltham runs across something weve been hiding or sees something he shouldnt youre going to come up with excuses fast If they involve you saying that youve got to talk to me before you can figure out what youre authorized to say now thats not great but Elias wont hit you Ferrers sickening fake smile vanishes Any time you start saying too much in front of Imaginary Keltham and making up excuses that are any more complicated than they need to be Elias is going to hit you

I acknowledge my errors I acknowledge I need the practice and I know if I argue youre going to make it longer which you are very welcome to To my mind we never meaningfully had the option of telling him it was Abadar Abadar has a country right near here and he already knows that and its an incredibly obvious place to go when he gets fed up and leaves If you want him to even contemplate hiding out in a forest or extradimensional space somewhere and not contacting other governments he needs to think he has an obscure god not one running a country right next door Hes not stupid enough to fail to think that I might be lying about the sexism or that there might be a good justification for it and its not an argument against Abadar strong enough to stop Keltham trying to contact them You should find him an obscure Tian deity

I appreciate that you are monitoring a tendency towards excuses more complicated than they need to be I am noticing a tendency towards plans that require using a degree of ability to manipulate Kelthams environs which I would prefer he believe Golarion magic does not enable The High Priestess asked me this morning if my recommendation that we explain Otolmens to Keltham overrode her very reasonable heuristics about sharing less about Otolmens and I was not willing to persist in a recommendation against such advice but if Id thought through that her plan involved us consistently deploying reflexive counterspells to protect the invisibility of Otolmens representative while Keltham flings around fourth circle cleric magic aimed at discovering concealed things I would have persisted in my recommendation If Invisibility Purge hadnt discovered Otolmens oracle Glimpse of Truth would have you cant inconspicuously counterspell True Seeing and then its apparent we deliberately hid him from Invisibility Purge discovery If I had thought of the oracle fast enough I wouldve told Security to do nothing using abilities other than put people in other rooms and if that wasnt fast enough to solve the problem so be it Abadars going to keep giving Keltham spells in that genre and honestly the oracle is the most innocuous explanation for them have an invisible person running around with Security constantly counterspelling and actively interfering in Kelthams efforts to discover them is an extraordinary expenditure of our effort to keep a secret I at this point forcefully recommend we stop keeping Otolmens is the kind of institution Keltham is used to cooperating with and we should tell him sufficient true things for him to conclude that

Your argument on Abadar is reasonable and I have downgraded my estimate of the severity of your error It remains that your current excuses are too visibly extemporized Your excuses wouldnt fool me Sevar they look like excuses to somebody who knows what that is Im not saying you should be choosing excuses to fool me you should be choosing them to fool Keltham But right now were only getting away with this because Keltham is an outsider and that makes us pathetic and unworthy of the responsibility Asmodeus placed on us Yes you need a dose of that practice now and not just later That youre already exhausted is part of the point Twenty minutes with Elias today more later and dont mistake the reduction for mercy its about the degree to which you being slightly better rested tomorrow is a military priority

Ive filed your request for somebody who can train you in conventional honeypot tactics Ive filed your request for the alternate Taldor history and put my own commendation and priority on it its not just a workable idea it gives us an organizing principle that this chaos of an operation desperately needs Well tell Broom that were fine with Kelthams terms for showing himself in front of Keltham and ask him politely not to stalk Keltham invisibly until we see how much Invisibility Purge Keltham throws around assuming thats what you meant Ill re query our policy on keeping Otolmenss existence a secret to the people authorized to make decisions that potentially destroy Golarion Youll brief the girls tomorrow morning on your new plans Am I missing anything Sevar

No sir It is in some strange way cheering to be told that they are pathetic and unworthy of the responsibility Asmodeus placed on them because of course all humans are pathetic and unworthy but it only merits comment if in this context they are expected not to be Maybe sometimes when the stakes are high enough some humans figure out how to not be pathetic and unworthy Or at least how to be less so

She looks over at Elias How much does he look like he would prefer this training to involve hitting her a lot yeah valid Carissa too if she were in a different role in this operation would feel like hitting Carissa a lot 

Keltham figures out that you dont really love him Elias says smiling at her 

Gosh accusations about drawing ones internal conceptual boundaries wrong are the kind of thing Id have guessed would be Complicated Romance in dath ilan In Cheliax no ones running around with a baseline expectation anyone could possibly have drawn them coherently in the first place

 thats not even an excuse

Best excuses usually arent I think I should get to hit him if I have a really good one she tells Maillol

Hold still Maillol says and delivers three hard carefully measured punches into the pit of Sevars stomach

You just lost some of the respect I was gaining for you Sevar he says when hes done Any spite you hold for him is something you can work on while youre not doing something I told you to do Elias if she acts unprofessional or like shes not taking the exercise seriously punish her no less than Asmodeuss Law calls for Punish her any more and I expect Hell will have something to say about that too in due time Now take this somewhere else Maillol has infinity plus one paperworks to file

Some parlors have been repurposed into common rooms

Keltham learns about malediction

In general there are spells for changing your alignment to what you want it to be before you die called Atonement but theyre expensive and really hard to access so Asmodeus made a Asmodeus specific one thats cheaper

Oh so it only gets used on people who want to go to Hell

Why in the world would you try to use it on someone who wanted to go somewhere else Thered be an enormous god diplomatic incident about it Id expect

Keltham learns that the girls arent getting paid

 are they not Fucking pay the girls we arent telling any lies that we dont need to

Slap Not an excuse

Thats bizarre and Ill go ask site leadership what went wrong immediately

Keltham learns that the girls were drafted

When you enlist in the Chelish military you promise to go where youre needed That is how every military in the world functions do dath ilan militaries not require such oaths

Keltham learns that youre getting sex training

 well obviously Im getting sex training hes had it and Id like to keep up Also I figured I should see a professional about my relaxation problem

Keltham learns primary worship of other gods is illegal

Primary worship means like breaking other local law specifically on the command of foreign gods its mentioned as separately illegal from the breaking other local law because most of the general rules about criminal conspiracies dont apply very neatly to criminal conspiracies where you never interact with your co conspirators and dont know anything about what exactly theyre trying to achieve Obviously if youre not breaking any laws in the first place then what would it even mean to make it illegal to worship a god

Keltham learns Cheliax executes people for lse majest

Ive never heard of that actually happening Its a thing people say about kings they dislike and probably at some point in history was true of some of them but Abrogail Thrunes not a thin skinned maniac whose brain stopped fully functioning thirty years ago like a lot of kings are and most king related abuses are those kings

Keltham learns that the girls sold their souls

Most people make arrangements before they die with a devil who has a specialty theyre interested in or who lives in the plane of Hell they want to live in or whatever The alternative is getting thrown into general processing which can be slow when a lot of people die at once and it can be expensive and take a long time to get somewhere right for you The girls hadnt yet because theyre so young but now theyre at elevated risk of death and also have highly secret information so Im not surprised they made arrangements

Keltham learns that that vision was of Asmodean Hell

 Keltham weve got to get out of here Securityll have scrolls of Teleport on them and I know how to read one do you have something from your god thatll take someone on Security down if we take them by surprise 

I assume theres a plan from there

Well not yet but hopefully there will be by the time its relevant if it is does Security carry scrolls of Teleport if not Im not sure how we can make our implausible escape

Sometimes but were in a Forbiddance

I do have a plan for that Im going to fly out with him clinging to me both invisible and then cast the Teleport from midair Luckily no one will see us

Thats a lot of thought to have put into your romantic escape with Keltham

Look if you think Im a traitor it doesnt make any sense to mildly chide me about it and if you dont then it doesnt make any sense to mildly chide me for looking it

I think youre enough of a chameleon to be a traitor if the circumstances presented themselves Keltham finds out you tortured some orphans to death for practice

I absolutely have not done that

Keltham finds out most people dont want to go to Hell

Good is popular because they run soup kitchens and orphanages and so on People think of them as the people who helped them when they needed it So they want to be Good but that doesnt actually get you Good its not Good itself its just vague identification

Keltham finds out you reported people to the authorities for disloyal thoughts

Some demons at the Worldwound can fuck with your mind We have a monitoring system set up to catch anyone who gets infected before they slit all their bunkmates throats in the night and eat their eyeballs yes that has happened yes Ive reported people for further monitoring who I thought had thought patterns that might point them that way

Carissa loves her job 

Ione doesnt mind this part of her job at all In accordance with the general instruction to tell no lies that Security explained to her apparently Carissa Sevar is running this show now which but fine Ione is actually remembering and writing her own descriptions without secretly grabbing the cleric spellbook and cheating Though that makes some sense even if Iones descriptions looked too much like the book descriptions after the book gets returned to the library Keltham might notice

An hour isnt really much time to write down that many cleric spells and one sentence descriptions but heres what Iones got

Aaaaaand shes out of time Security wants her later drafts too

Ione on reflection is feeling concerned about Cheliaxs chances of fooling Keltham if Abadar grants more carefully chosen spells like Abadars Truthtelling The Asmodeans may be out of their depth here possibly she as a smarter Nethysian should actually grab that library book and start working out strategies for Cheliax to follow if Abadar grants Keltham a spell like Lesser Planar Ally or a Conditional Favor that Keltham uses with a condition of dont lie to me

Well Asmodeus isnt actually stupid like some of His worshippers Ione doesnt think Maybe Hell grant the clerics here appropriate spells like False Future in case Keltham gets Augury and Undetectable Alignment in case Keltham uses Aura Sight on Ione and obviously Spell Gauge so theyre not caught off guard by what Keltham receives though Spell Gauge only goes up to 3rd circle and youd need a 7th circle caster to get all of Kelthams spells up to there 

Does Cheliax have a plan B Is Ione part of it Shes an obvious person that Keltham might try to whisper to if Keltham notices something wrong She should ask about that later

Security comes and takes a look and adds back in Aura Sight since he already knows that it exists but not Invisibility Purge since ideally it wouldnt look like they added everything he knows exists Other than that theyre satisfied 

Is there a plan if Keltham gets suspicious of something and wants to talk to me about it Ione says as she starts to recopy that particular page Voice of reassurance worried ally wholl help him investigate

Help him investigate if he wants to flee flee with him but convince him that no other church or government is worth going to either Therell be a more detailed briefing on the plan and various contingencies in the morning

Oh

Ohhhh

Lord Nethys does have some secret plan that encompasses His intricate understanding of every move that lesser beings make thinking their choices their own

Going to fantastic lengths to make sure Keltham can get five books a day faster than Security could order them from Chelish libraries doesnt make that much sense as the sole object of an expensive divine intervention so Ione had supposed that she was going to be there to influence Keltham in a subtle way or maybe see something that Asmodeans wouldnt see because theyre too busy gouging each others eyes out

If you get Keltham to flee to a remote wilderness hideout or some old dungeon thats blocked from scrying hes not going to get much research done unless he has a library oracle with him Ione observes Keltham knows that Hell come to me early on Maybe first Ill need enough books to turn some room wherever I go into a library I think one full bookshelf should do it but two would be better She wants to ask rather acerbically if any Asmodean even noticed that their plan wouldnt work without Lord Nethys propping it up but she is not quite that courageous yet

Yes Were creating modified books as fast as we can Ill try to get you a list If you have thoughts on a plausible use of your powers to help Keltham escape we want that to look organic and not strikingly lucky

I cant directly travel through Polyfractal Library Space until Im more powerful Ione replies before she quite realizes what shes been asked

Keltham is still trying not to access any audiovisual memories of his vision of wherever whatever that was Probably not literally a video because because you probably shouldnt be able to scry like that across a Forbiddance okay blatant rationalization but it creates a self consistent branch of reality he can tell his emotions to shelter inside while he absorbs the blow

By way of distraction he first wrote down memory anchors for all his pending sex questions to submit to Carissa later while theyre not in the middle of sex this being in dath ilan a completely reasonable and well known tactic to overcoming the distracting conversations that are the fundamental obstacle to sex Plus he needed to do that before they slipped his mind

Currently hes trying to invent a signaling code that his god can use to send him information via that god choosing Kelthams spells

Since he doesnt have his spell list yet what Keltham can do right now is note down which conditions he would like to distinguish which is in any case a good first step for designing a code

The first thing he should do is reserve a condition for my god cant communicate with me in this way Arguendo This could obviously be done by expending one spell slot to signal just this communication channel works at all which spells absence then means that nothing else worked Counter arguendo that might be redundant if the other consistent states of the code seem sufficiently unlikely to arise by chance or optimization around other criteria since the absence of a consistent code state would automatically imply channel failure Keltham isnt going to pick some intricate code that makes full use of every possible bit of information in every spell choice since that might not make it across the prayer communication medium going the other direction Counter counter arguendo During initial establishment of this communications channel probably a lot of bits should be expended on error codes Suppose for now that some very exotic spell gets picked to signal the condition this works as a communication channel at all and its absence indicates failure of the whole scheme

Or maybe if he gets a long enough spell list he can have a choice of four otherwise unused spells signaling

Question 1 Does this communications channel work

Spell 11 This communications channel should work fine
Spell 12 This communications channel works at all but may have errors
Spell 13 This communications channel is very expensive Use it very sparingly
Spell 14 This communications channel is both expensive and error prone
1none of the above Basic channel failure

Plus actually

Spell 15 Some element of the code you used is problematic Try again with a different code Other spells received should not be interpreted

And Keltham should not ask too many questions on the rest of this first try before he finds out whether cases 13 14 hold

What does he really really need to know

Question 2 What overall strategy is appropriate to his current situation

Spell 21 Take your current situation at face value and cooperate with the surrounding project
Spell 22 Your current situation is not what it seems use tomorrows code for more info but its still good to go on doing research
Spell 23 Exercise your supposed right to leave as soon as you can use tomorrows code to figure out where to go Stall them on more valuable info in the meanwhile
Spell 24 They wouldnt actually let you leave Ask about escape or other options using tomorrows code Stall info
Spell 25 You are in imminent danger IMMEDIATELY ask to leave your current location and go somewhere else in Cheliax or a Lawful Neutral country if accessible taking with only Carissa as a guide and not telling anyone else where youre going
Spell 2none None of those are good ways of looking at it

Keltham has of course realized that theres variants of 25 which imply he shouldnt take Carissa with him either but if the situation is that bad they wont just let him leave and if they wont just let him leave hes going to need more communication to figure out what he should do instead Its not like he can see any obvious escape plan as things stand

Actually now that Keltham thinks about it he was planning to use a more elaborate code and ask more questions besides those two but maybe he shouldnt even be asking any more than this on a first try at a channel It might not support that much weight

Well that does leave some room to potentially factor things and maybe Kelthams own communications will be a bit clearer if he considers more branch points and fewer total leaves

Version two

Question 1 Does this communications channel work

Spell 11 This channel works
Spell 1none Total channel failure

Question 2 Is this channel significantly expensive to Kelthams god

Spell 21 Yes
Spell 22 A little expensive use it only as needed
Spell 23 Not at all use it lots
Spell 2none Wrong question channel failure this question wasnt worth answering

Question 3 Is this channel error prone or noisy

Spell 31 No
Spell 32 Yes be careful
Spell 33 It fails only negatively you may miss a spell you should have got but not receive one you shouldnt have received
Spell 3none Wrong question channel failure not enough priority

Question 4 Could this channel handle more complex codes tomorrow

Spell 41 Yes
Spell 4none No or not priority

Question 5 Should you be cooperating with your apparent coworkers or stalling them on things that are really valuable dangerous

Spell 51 Cooperate at least for tomorrow inquire in more detail later
Spell 52 Begin stalling inquire in more detail later

This question is sufficiently important that 5none is a good candidate for just signaling total comms failure but redundancy

The other variations on v1s Question 2 dont actually imply any immediate change of policy besides stalling except of course for

Question 6 Imminent danger at current location

Spell 61 Yes Flee with Carissa and tell nobody else where youre going
Spell 6none Carrying out 61 wouldnt be a net improvement

 thats actually 11 total spells to take on signaling meaning compared to version 1 okay the fine detail in spell 33 is not something he needs to know literally during initial handshake which cuts v2 down to ten spells total and makes it superior to v1 because of the lower local branching clearer meanings and more critical meta info being conveyed earlier Besides eliminating Spell 33 are there other improvements to be made here

Actually eliminating 2 8ths of the total code seems like the sort of thing that could easily cross some key threshold for feasibility on the first try so if he cuts down on Q2 

Version three probably final

Question 1 Does this communications channel work

Spell 11 This channel works
Spell 1none Total channel failure

Question 2 Is this channel significantly expensive to Kelthams god

Spell 21 Not at all use it lots
Spell 2none Yes somewhat wrong question channel failure

Question 3 Is this channel error prone or noisy

Spell 31 No
Spell 32 Yes be careful
Spell 3none Yes wrong question channel failure not enough priority

Actually on further reflection he doesnt really need 32 here either since 3none can safely convey that information mixed into a wider bucket

Question 4 Could this channel handle more complex codes tomorrow

Spell 41 Yes
Spell 4none No or not priority

On yet further reflection Keltham can just ask this question tomorrow if he gets a no on things being noisy If yes on things being noisy but not expensive he should construct a redundant code tomorrow instead of a complicated one

Question 4 Should you be cooperating with your apparent coworkers or stalling them on things that are really valuable dangerous

Spell 41 Cooperate at least for tomorrow inquire in more detail later
Spell 42 Begin stalling inquire in more detail later
Spell 4none Redundant signal of total channel failure

Question 5 Imminent danger at current location

Spell 51 Yes Flee with Carissa and tell nobody else where youre going
Spell 5none Carrying out 51 wouldnt be a net improvement and or this channel element failed

Okay this is a code Keltham can believe in relative to his own level of design ability It frontloads the most important meta questions first delays as many complications as possible beyond the fragile first attempt and only requires him to keep five questions and six spell meanings in mind to communicate across his own side of the prayer channel

Keltham goes to seek the spell list from Ione

Ione gives Keltham the spell list I lost track of time while listing all the 1sts and 2nds and so theres fewer 3rds and 4ths Ione confesses I could probably generate more if you gave me more time

Keltham gives Ione a smile of this hopefully being good enough since he forgot that Ione wouldnt understand him unless he fetches Security again and heads back to his room

Those spells huh Those sure are some spells

Aura Sight is on the list but not Invisibility Purge Glimpse of Beyond but not Spell Immunity If theyd had all the spells he knew about but no new especially interesting ones that would indicate that they were being first order blatant about telling Ione what to include or exclude If theyd omitted Aura Sight too that might mean somebody didnt update Ione about the new list of what not to tell Keltham This pattern indicates either nothing much or that theyre able to do basic damn reflection about what Keltham is likely to think of things and avoided there being any blatant pattern in the spell list so it would mean nothing much

Anyways He needs to pick his spell request pattern for tomorrow morning and then sleep There were probably other things he told himself to review today but he is feeling a bit worn and not necessarily up for trying to remember what they all were Hopefully theyll keep

Today he got four cantrips six first circle four second circle three third circle two fourth circle spells Keltham should not assume his god can do that every time so leave some headway at each level

He wants Guidance and Detect Magic among cantrips If he had to pick spells on his own hed want at least one truth spell and at least one Comprehend Languages Owls Wisdom seems important to have in reserve for real emergencies however dangerous it may be to dath ilani who didnt want to be Keepers and you could say the same about Invisibility Purge By default hes got the truth spell and Sanctuary to keep overnight possibly cutting down expenses to his god some little bit

Are there any spells here that form useful mnemonic patterns with his questions and answers Though he should maybe also try to pick spells that his god wouldnt try to urgently assign him for other reasons And he needs to pick spells where he can see what they do upon a cast and without those spells harming the target

Oh huh Keltham thinks as he starts poking through the list for something weird enough that theres no way his god would assign it unless the communications channel worked

Early Judgment give someone a glimpse of their currently destined afterlife

Now theres a spell he wouldnt have expected Cheliax to show him if they were really trying to prevent him from figuring out his god or for that matter afterlives Can he use that to see somebody elses destined afterlife too and determine their real alignment even if theyre not third circle That definitely goes on the list not as a code just as a default request 

At this point Kelthams translation spell runs out but somebody is timing things pretty well and somebody arrives back to cast Share Language Taldane on him again

Lay of the Land 2nd grants instant knowledge of the surrounding lands it sounds like an unambiguously interpretable spell to cast and Keltham is unlikely to need it otherwise Could be used to signal this worked at all or to signal flee with Carissa semantically its a better fit for the second

Stone Shape 3rd clearly interpretable unlikely to be given otherwise Mnemonically it could mean 41 show them how to make things At 3rd circle its expensive though

Create Food and Water 3rd again unmistakeable effect mnemonically fits both 41 industrialize and 51 flee He needs to look at cheaper spells though

Okay Obscuring Mist 1st has unmistakeable effect and wouldve been an obvious fit for this channel is noisy but Keltham eliminated that answer spell leaving only this channel is clear it also works for immediately fleeing with Carissa Silly spells for silly adventurers everythings going to look like it was designed for fleeing with Carissa

Air Bubble 1st probably not something his god would need to assign him otherwise if he resolves not to do any chemistry experiments today clearly visible effect and it can stand for This channel is clear 31 or 11

Light uses up a relatively precious cantrip slot but it sure is unmistakeable Another good fit for several different possible mnemonics Hopefully not one his god would otherwise assign him

Create Water likewise uses up a cantrip slot but is unmistakeable and could mean this channel is cheap because water is cheap

Do they seriously mean create water and not just teleport it in by the way Because then why cant you also create very large amounts of energy E2 P2C2 M2C4 and all that

Oh Lighten Object 1st would also do to convey that things werent expensive

Share Language 2nd would correspond very well to teach them but its also something a helpful deaf god might assign if it thought that a student being able to hear a lecture in Baseline might be helpful to them

Silence 2nd and Silent Table 2nd are unmistakable and could mean some things And Silent Table sounds less like it might be granted by a god that thought Keltham needed to flee 2nd circle is still expensive compared to 1st

Oh and Read Weather is 1st and sounds unmistakeable and otherwise improbable to get even if it doesnt mean much At this point Keltham is ready to compromise on some meanings

So attempted code v1

11 Read Weather 1st This channel works at all and can tell you things like the Weather
21 Lighten Object 1st This channel doesnt cost much
31 Air Bubble 1st This channel is clear

That uses up all his 1st slots if he keeps Sanctuary and a truth spell and requests a new Comprehend Languages Wait didnt he want to keep one 1st circle slot clear in case his god cant assign him six first level spells every day Well its probably a little safer if hes keeping some of his old spells hopefully He may not have better options In 2nd he already has a request for Early Judgment and emergency Owls Wisdom 4 slots total of which he should leave one free and

51 Lay of the Land 2nd Run

Okay so instead of using expensive 3rds what if on the topic of whether to speak freely or stall

41 Light 0th Shed light on their ignorance
42 Create Water 0th Stall with a great volume of cheap stuff

Those are alternates so they only use up one cantrip slot leaving the other two free for Guidance and Detect Magic and the fourth for his gods choice or empty because his god strained itself to give him so many spells before

And then when it comes to 3rd and 4th he could mostly leave that up to his god but if his god wants any suggestions Keltham will go on Invisibility Purge for 3rd and he doesnt really have much he wants in 4th Well he could ask for Tongues and use that to free up the valuable 1st level slot occupied by Comprehend Languages Actually can clerics request lower level spells in higher spell slots That would make his life noticeably simpler in this regard and save his god money Keltham should have asked this question earlier

Keltham starts to stand up to go outside and call Security to ask this question but then it occurs to him to try a different experiment Just in case you know

Security Keltham says to the empty room not particularly loudly

On recently communicated orders Security is to be behind a wall from Keltham at all times its feasible They can keep a closer eye with a scrying sensor 

This summons is not answered

Keltham steps outside his bedroom and again tries the Security call

Security goes visible this time within his field of view taking off a ring 

Wait the reason I never see you guys until called is that youre also invisible

Yes 

You know Im going to ask explicitly because Im confused if the idea here is that you were trying to hide the concept of invisibility generally from me and that didnt work so now you think theres no more point in hiding it or hiding the fact that you were hiding it or if I reacted to that earlier incident in a way you considered weird and like you didnt understand why I was so offended and now youre trying to be more explicit about something you thought was innocuous or what

 Security is invisible when our visible presence has not been requested because should anyone attempt to attack you knowing our positions and numbers would advantage them over knowing were around but not where Security is trained to activate or deactivate magic items while alone where possible emerging only once not occupied with activation or deactivation Guidelines were recently updated to note that you prefer persons in a room with you not be invisible and that this ought to take precedence over the rule not to activate or deactivate magic items in company barring a time pressured or dangerous situation

 legit Maybe when I get more used to Golarion local customs thatll change but yeah I currently prefer you be visible around me for now in non emergency situations Thank you for considerateness

My question was going to be if you happen to know whether clerics always get the same number of spells of each circle every day and whether they can request lower circle spells to fill up a higher circle slot if theyd rather have the lower one

The same number and circle distribution of spells are typically granted to a cleric each day You can request lower circle spells in a higher circle slot

Thank you very much for that information And just to be very clear on my general policy if Security accommodating my weird preferences means Im probably going to die please have an explicit conversation with me about that instead of doing it my way Keltham heads back to his bedroom

So if his god doesnt have anything better to do with them maybe use one 3rd slot and one 4th slot on an additional Owls Wisdom to potentially tap a student with and an additional Early Judgment to see if he can look at somebody elses current afterlife destination with it

And thats a plan for prayer tomorrow

Keltham tucks himself into what passes for a bed in Golarion Good night Cheliax

Zon Kuthon cultists dont attack in the middle of the night yet growth mindset

Before dawn a mysterious and unnaturally beautiful woman steps without any sound whatsoever into Carissa Sevars bedroom If you were to trust your eyes looking at her she would look like a very high level Asmodean fighter with obviously magical armor and arms decorated in barbs spikes stylized flames

She lights a black candle that burns with a dark crimson flame and then speaks

Carissa Sevar

 startles awake like someone who startles awake a lot 

She doesnt sleep clothed in Cheliax her sleep clothes are for the Worldwound and far too warm However she thinks thats not at the top of the priority list here 

Yes she says because anyone in here has the security clearance to know that surely

I am a high ranking noble who chooses not to identify herself for now A playful smile backed with such vast Splendour that even Sevar is going to feel very briefly like she is really being invited to some harmless pleasant game Im wondering whether youd be interested in overthrowing the Queen of Cheliax Oh and your little security wizards wont think theres anything unusual about our conversation while that black candle burns

Carissa wants to be that pretty and to have a voice that rings that confidently and to have lips that move that seductively

 and to survive the next hour Lets do that one first Its a test obviously its a test but there are all kinds of things one tests for Loyalty the willingness to say I serve my Queen even when its a losing move in the moment Theological purity going through the right mental motions on your way to the truth Strategic competence where one gets to contemplate considerations like how if this is real immediately angering the powerful stranger is a poor path to protecting the Queen or the country 

I serve Asmodeus she says and bites her tongue hard so erasing her memory of this conversation will also require healing her and theres still the hope of recognizing the taste of blood in her mouth 

Oh absolutely Thats rather the point dear The current Queen has a pact with Asmodeus The Queen is not Asmodeuss servant The compact between the Thrice Damned House of Thrune and Asmodeus Himself specifies that He is not to punish them in Hell for presuming to pursue their own interests as well as His in this world Now somebody truly loyal to Asmodeus someone who Asmodeus deemed worthy even of His explicit notice to be someday among the most treasured souls in His possession might perhaps think it was presumptuous for the Thrunes to dare to bargain so with our god as if the Thrunes were only His juniors and not His servants Or simply believe that it served Asmodeus better to have a Queen who was His slave in truth

Carissa does not understand Aspexia Rugatonn but shes met her and so she has a fraction more context with which to reject this than she would have had yesterday when she would have rejected it on general principle You do not serve a god by giving his interventions unexpected effects 

So thats the question answered but not the strategic situation at all resolved only in tests for five year olds do you win by defiantly screaming the truth for all the world to hear And the Church and Queen do diverge sometimes Maillols story about the slave implied it and its possible this is a test from a different angle than Aspexia Rugatonns The first priority is to survive it then to report it then to seek correction in any mistaken details of her understanding of precisely why you do not overthrow the Queen of Cheliax 

I presume myself to understand nothing about the Queen or her House or any matters in which I have not been directed she says But I was directed that if I serve Asmodeus in this world I will be raised high in it and so I will listen to your explanation I assume you have more of one

How could she possibly win this She hasnt prepared her spells yet she isnt sure if shell get enough sleep tonight to prepare her spells One should of course die for their country as needed but if theres a plot against the Queen it is better to live to report it She can try talking her way into getting more time unsupervised but that kind of Splendour usually comes with excellent interpersonal reading and she shouldnt count on it Can she cancel the candle Quietly trigger a ward 

Dear I have the transcript of your conversation with Hell And not from the Grand High Priestess either A playfully raised eyebrow You asked for a county I believe That doesnt sound to me like a meek little unambitious thing who knows nothing about any matters in which she hasnt been directed Do discard that pretense What do you want from your mortal life Carissa Sevar besides a county and a crafting allowance Do your ambitions lead you to want a more Asmodean rule of this country for you to be raised high in Would you take the throne yourself if you could If your answer is that Asmodeus would hold either ambition against you Id like to hear your explanation of the theology behind that The Church doesnt teach that Her Infernal Majestrix is a poor Asmodean for having presumed to murder her predecessor Infrexus

On paper Infrexus I accidentally drowned For a seventh circle sorcerer to accidentally drown and then for Cheliax to accidentally forget they had any clerics who could resurrect him is the sort of story you put in the official history books when you actually dont want people getting confused about what really happened

Disrupting the candle seems doable but if the womans smart the candle will have nothing to do with whatever protections might hide this conversation from security She didnt even claim it did just while this candle burns and while youre not supposed to give in to the temptation to speak to adversaries in beautiful technical truths like that when a simple lie would do its still information

Well see I dont know how Id like having a county and it was pointed out to me that if it had been the will of Asmodeus that I have one He could have ordered it And it feels like theres an incoherence in the claim that Asmodeus wants a slave and not one who made a pact with Him to serve their own interests and in claiming that Carissas own interests point her towards power but confusions there dont matter very much because theres already no way that the Church desires this and her top priority now isnt parsing out precisely why not And the throne as you note seems to burn one up sooner or later besides which it feels implausible youd go to all this trouble to put someone else on it

Youre more boring than Id hoped Carissa for someone who made such fascinating inroads into our new pet outsider I hope you can exchange a more seductive banter than this on those occasions when your new profession calls for it Come come I know you think this a test but theyll hardly hold it against you if you try not to bore me so you could survive and report as you ought to if this is not a test Or you could even try a little honesty with me if youd really never raise a hand against the Queen and tell me honestly why not Im hardly going to kill Asmodeuss own favored if I am as Ive presented myself

She tries quietly to trigger a ward at the door with a Mage Hand nothing evidently happens

Sure fine shell do the five year old thing she doesnt actually see how to do better and its a way to keep talking They teach different shards of Asmodeanism I think to nobles I havent learned them I dont know how the Queen justifies herself or if she needs to perhaps she acted only directed by the advisors Asmodeus sent her more loyal and obedient than she cares to have anyone guess But I know whats going on here A lot is going on here and its very important more important to Asmodeus I think than how mortals He owns conceive of their loyalty to Him even mortals who are the Queen He intervened here so that our pathetic inadequate efforts to represent Him and our country here might stand a chance of success they otherwise wouldnt Im supposed to be here And if I invent a way to correct the flaws in human nature and make us His worthy servants then perhaps Ill get some titles out of that as it pleases the Queen but if I merely learn for Cheliax how the exact same bit of metal is manufactured three thousand times over to a precision so high they will all interlock then I will still have wisely spent the resources that Crown and Church have allocated here And I would have to be an idiot to risk any of that to correct some flaw in Cheliax that is in the slightest less time sensitive

Also you know it would be treason and treason is wrong

A little laugh as if sharing a joke Funny But what if the Queen is not so content to leave you be as you are to leave her to her unimportant temporal throne Abrogail Thrune is very nearly the only person in Cheliax who would slay you out of hand with Asmodeus having made His own interest in you clear The slaves of Church and Queen have been instructed not to punish you more than you earn Abrogail Thrune is not one of those slaves She is Asmodeuss very junior partner or so she presumes to see it If Abrogail slays you to keep Cheliax all for herself and protect her own interests her pact with Asmodeus prohibits her punishment in Hell for that It does not even contradict the wording of Hells instructions Are you really sure it serves your own interests however selflessly Asmodean they may be for Abrogail or some other non slave like her to sit on Cheliaxs throne

The slaves of Church and Queen have been instructed also not to be proactive in my education but to leave it to me to seek you claim to have seen the transcript so you must be aware of this and no slave of Church and Queen yourself which is accusing the stunningly beautiful woman of being the Queen which Carissa did not intend to do at the start of that sentence but it does seem to be the logical place where it logically went Not that she believes the words she merely said them

An appearance changes

My my Shouldnt you be kneeling then

This too might be a test 

 but might not Its true that Aspexia Rugatonn didnt want people being proactive with Carissa And that theres very few people who would defy her on that 

And once again there is the infernal difficulty that if its a test it is not always obvious what is being tested And that it being a test doesnt at all mean you cant die of failing it 

Should I your Majesty I was taught to kneel if your entourage passed down a street I was walking on but my school omitted any lessons for how to comport myself should you appear in my bedroom Perhaps in bedrooms one prostrates oneself as for a pharaoh

Mm You saw the possibility but you dont believe its me I suppose I should credit you for having thought of it at all You might be surprised how many people dont

Im reading your mind right now of course Would you slay me if Aspexia Rugatonn told you that Id outlived my usefulness to Lord Asmodeus

The obvious reflexive no would not be useful information to the genuine Queen of Cheliax the thought process might be but shell have to let it play out and she doesnt actually know its exact contents until it plays out which 

 it would be so irritating to mostly have peoples minds full of thoughts about whether youre going to kill them Carissa will strive to avoid that The other obvious not reassuring answer is that this is not guidance Aspexia Rugatonn would give 

 because Asmodeus doesnt overthrow Pharasma 

 because even if you wanted the Queen of Cheliax taken out you would not involve any third circle wizards in your plans they are weak enough to actively be far more of a liability than an aid 

 because Asmodeuss directions to Carissa are narrow and Aspexia Rugatonn wants to interpret them narrowly do the obvious things and not other things that cloud Asmodeuss vision with noise and confusion 

 but it is true that Chelish monarchs get assassinated a lot presumably with the Churchs implicit support so maybe Carissa is the one misunderstanding believing that Asmodeanism does actually say you shouldnt murder your Queen 

 some part of Carissas brain chimes up that she shouldnt murder the Queen because the Queen is really pretty Thank you that part of Carissas brain for reminding her that humans are fundamentally contemptible beings 

 Carissa notes that the only people ever to have been acknowledged as killing a King or Queen of Cheliax is another of House Thrune presumably because for everyone else Asmodeuss law does apply and does ban regicide and if you succeed they still put you to death they dont make you a deal That might even be part of the pact that House Thrune can play among themselves but neednt fear their entire country made weapons pointed at them neednt fear the chaos of being Taldor or of the civil wars before Hell rose to power in Cheliax 

 there are rules here and she doesnt know them 

Only if you command it your Majesty she says and at this point indeed kneels

Not the new playmate Id hoped for not the potential inconvenience I thought worth a personal visit Understand Sevar I will not lightly break one of my senior partners toys but if I need do so I will petrify you ward the statue against detection and bury your trapped soul deep enough that ages would not expose it again Perhaps in time Asmodeus will see you in His embrace at last or perhaps some little inconvenience will end all Pharasmas works before then for all Otolmenss pains

Ferrer Maillol is a competent administrator as Asmodean priests go but he lacks vision Abrogails voice is not at all seductive now it commands demands We are not satisfied with Cheliax being taught the outsiders secrets of metalworking We do not expect Lord Asmodeus will be satisfied with it either Not if other countries also come to possess those secrets We desire that Cheliax gain advantage from this Carissa Sevar Why our Lord has instructed that we do not simply keep the outsider for our own I do not know for certain but it is not an instruction I intend to defy

This being so we particularly desire that Cheliax not be left in an unfortunate position by an outsider propagating a powerful Lawful Neutral philosophy which enables its masters to unravel secrets of the magicless and perhaps the magical world but which introduced to Chelish students inevitably casts them into heresy so that only priests and the soul sold slaves of Asmodeus can safely be taught it We do not have enough of those to compete with Osirion and Lastwall if all their wizards and clerics and tinkerers are being taught those new ways If the outsider teaches widely elsewhere it will be a trivial matter to steal his teachings but we must be able to use what we copy

Maillols previous instructions to you are revoked His understanding of Asmodeuss will failed You have no priority higher than learning the core source of power of Kelthams world and transforming it into a form that Asmodean students can learn and remain Asmodeans Better yet burn and refine their iron to steel show what their philosophy can become when it embraces power and pain and wield that to raise a force that could crush dath ilan under our heel Do that and I as Asmodeuss designate here will say that you served Him well and raise you high within this world

Is it completely ridiculous and contemptible to feel disappointed she lacks the deftness or ambition or whatever to be a new playmate to the Queen of Cheliax Yes Are humans completely ridiculous and contemptible Also yes 

But she gets an assignment for her project for the one she yes sensed they were going to need in a world that had Keltham in it at all 

 yes your Majesty

Abrogail tosses a small bag down by where Carissa kneels Your crafting allowance Sevar A little gold a little spellsilver It will only open to your own hand left or right either one You didnt earn it but Hells instructions do not say that I may not reward you a little more than you have earned

As for what that bag does to the hand that opens it youre allowed to have it healed once its over

If someday you change your opinions on the importance of mortal thrones and become a worthy playmate after all do remember how early I started planning for that Just because I like to play doesnt mean Ill entertain a serious possibility of losing

Abrogail leans over to blow out the black candle and the moment the crimson flame goes out it appears that she and the candle are gone

Some kind of illusion The Forbiddance is still up isnt it The bag remains by Carissa Sevars hand

 she stands 

 security she says weakly I have uh the experience of having spent the last ten minutes talking with an intruder who represented herself as the Queen

No immediate reply

Then Carissas going to get dressed take her agonizing Bag of Holding and step out into the hallway

Well theres nobody in the hallway so far as that goes

 Keltham The first priority when theres any suggestion that security has been compromised Carissa runs

Shes intercepted before she gets far by somebody who looks like Atanasio Torres

I no longer envy you the attention you get the person who looks like Atanasio Torres observes Zero one nine four eight yes that was the Queen Need a sleep spell or will you be able to manage on your own

 any illusions show up to Detect Magic

Not at her caster circle

I dont need a sleep spell but I need to report first Is Maillol in the temple

Torres didnt think shed fall for that trap but trying is a habit he doesnt think much about Just back from his four hour meeting in Egorian Torres says dryly

Carissa wants to come up with some kind of wisecrack about that but shes having her adrenaline crash now and shes too tired Mmmm she says because she does appreciate the warning and goes off to the temple To knock on Maillols door Hopefully someone else has already told him the news so she at least wont be breaking it to him

Ferrer Maillol is relieved to see Sevar here so quickly because it means that Sevar and the Queen are not having sex which would not have been something he needed in his life Hes tired enough from having to kneel patiently while three eighth circle wizards argued about why nobody figured out heritage math if heritage math was actually that simple and the Queen of Cheliax read transcripts of Sevars thoughts while having sex while making interesting and obviously deliberate facial expressions where Maillol could see them

Sevar I confirm that was Her Infernal Majestrix

Thank you Am I supposed to provide my best recollection of the conversation

Her Infernal Majestrix has instructed that I am not to proactively inquire into the contents of her conversation with you but if you seek instruction of your own accord I am allowed to laugh Those were her literal words

Well it seems like you could use a laugh Sir

I do not need my life to be any more humorous than it already is in fact And you need to get enough sleep to prepare spells today If your questions arent going to keep you up ask later and if they will get a sleep spell Unless its brief

No its just that shes really curious about her Evil Bag Of Holding Good night sir

Asmodeus uphold you Sevar He has her new intelligence headband now in fact but hes not giving it to her until shes slept enough to prepare spells because wizards are all insane

If wizards are insane they are in good company with apparently the entire rest of the world including the gods 

Carissa has a lot of practice at waking up for a life or death fight in the middle of the night and then going right back to sleep It is in many ways a combat wizards core skillset She sleeps immediately and soundly with her Evil Bag Of Holding clutched at her side

Keltham wakes up more muzzily than the previous day to dawns light coming through his windows The non fully opaqueable windows seem less like a design flaw if clerics have to pray for their spells during the dawn hour

All right Lets do this

Keltham reviews his notes from the previous night written appropriately cryptically and then prays trying to cast his mind Beyond maybe in the direction that wasnt the three space or one time looking toward his deity the Lawful Neutral god of people wanting to follow the protocols they must follow in order for their interactions to be mutually beneficial come to the Pareto frontier coordinate without vast enforcement costs summing to powerful societies and markets even when people largely pursue their own individual interests individually because they never step on others in order to do that

Requests obviously subject to amendation should his unknown god deem there to be better spells he could get

And also

If conditional spell assignment works at all for communication with his god please assign Read Weather 1st
If the communication doesnt cost much please assign Lighten Object 1st
If the communication seems like it should be error free and reliable please assign Air Bubble 1st
If Keltham should speak freely and teach as much as he can to his hosts please assign Light 0th
If Keltham should instead stall them with relatively less dangerous material please assign Create Water 0th
And if Keltham should run the ass out of here today with just Carissa and tell nobody else where hes going please assign Lay of the Land 2nd

Any remaining slots should be assigned as his god sees fit

 Keltham would also like to talk if now is a better time than yesterday for whatever reason Keltham has many questions about how he can best cooperate in a mutually beneficial way with his god

Presumably Pharasmas had time to review Otolmens reports by now and the absence of communications from her suggests that its fine to proceed as normal

It is TRUE that Pharasma has now had time to review Otolmenss first report about the anomaly

However Pharasma has NOT had time to review the second third fourth or most recently FIFTH additional reports that Otolmens THEN had to file dealing with the ABSURD and INCREASINGLY RAPID escalation of DIVINE INTERVENTIONS around the region She SPECIFICALLY SAID everyone needed to STOP intervening in Abadar may be familiar with the THIRD report in this sequence It concerns the mortals acquisition of SEVEN CLERIC LEVELS Yet ANOTHER report concerns an intervention by ASMODEUS who Otolmens is aware is GOOD FRIENDS with ABADAR Then there are interferences by NETHYS and for some reason CAYDEN CAILEAN and Otolmens is still wondering what IOMEDAE was doing in that pseudohypothetical chat

Otolmens is willing to entertain that there are possible replies to a prayer which would make further events LESS COMPLICATED such as commanding the anomalous mortal to REMAIN STILL AND NOT MOVE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS Is Abadar planning to send a reply like that

Mortals literally die of that And also Abadar does not command his mortals He trades with them 

Otolmens FAILS to see why a mortal dying would be BAD as they are LITERALLY DESIGNED TO DO THAT and do so ALL THE TIME but if for some reason it IS bad then the NEARBY mortals will no doubt HEAL that one

 well the mortal did want to use a secret code to ask whether to give Cheliax good information or stall them Abadar knows that god agreements prohibit using cleric spell assignments as a poor mans Commune but Perhaps Otolmens would consider it acceptable for Abadar to tell the mortal to stall 

Instruct the mortal to CONCEAL information CONCEALING information usually makes situations MORE COMPLICATED because then agents have DIFFERENT PICTURES of what is HAPPENING and their actions do not conduce to ANY coherent strategy or goal even those goals that most mortals usually share such as NOT DESTROYING REALITY

A compelling argument Cheliax is currently concealing information from the mortal and Abadar just wants to straighten that out which will probably make the situation less complicated for all the very good reasons Otolmens just listed

WHY are the surrounding natives concealing information from the anomaly Do they suspect that if given any information the anomaly will use it to DEDUCE THE NATURE OF REALITY and then DESTROY IT

Yes They do

Oh come on

Asmodeus cannot exactly see everything going on down there but a lot of what His mortals are concealing is indeed of the true nature of reality flavor Abadar should absolutely not blow that up within 57000 time units just because hes sour that the mortal hasnt gone to Him 

The thing Abadar is angry about is that the mortal is being systematically lied to and exploited when he would be a really excellent trade partner for decent people

And hell get around to it no doubt But the impatience is unbecoming really

It seems to Abadar that Otolmens might reasonably consider Asmodeuss conduct in Hell a threat to the stability of the Material Plane if concealing it is necessary to prevent threats to the stability of the Material Plane and Asmodeus has never before been bothered to conceal this It seems to Abadar that the mortal wants a nice rich stable world and is more likely to endanger it if he ends up getting the wrong subset of information about the world like might happen if you are Asmodeus and maliciously lying to advance your own interests It seems to Abadar that containing the mortal by trying to learn his dangerous secrets while concealing Asmodeuss own dangerous secrets is an obviously doomed plan and its absurd for Otolmens to countenance that and not countenance Abadar telling the mortal a small set of true non inflammatory things such as Cheliax is lying to you and my country has preexisting contractual arrangements for similar situations and will respect your intellectual property

Otolmens is becoming increasingly WORRIED about what Asmodeus is PLANNING if it is not simply CONTAINMENT If the surrounding natives are withholding information from the anomaly mortal as part of a PLAN by ASMODEUS then perhaps it would be better after all if Abadar told His mortal not to 

Nethys would like to say hi again Nethys knows youre looking in this direction Nethys knows youre wondering whether Nethys really has a plan that encompasses all of this chaos and is leading up to something interesting And if Nethys does have a plan like that what is that plans objective Could it possibly be the destruction of all reality

Well Nethys is proud to announce that Nethys DOES have a plan Definitely A plan that encompasses even Abadars own predictable reactions to how things are going so far Nethys isnt going to tell you anything about the objective of that plan though Then you would get bored and stop looking and Nethys finds it useful to overhear your conversations

WHAT

Keltham gets a sense of inhuman presence stronger than last time and if you were going to assign emotions to sensory passing thunderstorms more frustrated and

That is confusing

First of all the communications channel failed utterly Not too surprising in retrospect If it was a technique that worked people would use it all the time and have invented more complex codes for god communication by now Obviously not reliable reasoning the way it would be in dath ilan because his Chelish hosts could be concealing well known techniques from him and also because the entire planet of Golarion is one enormous gap of otherwise expected social competencies But still not too surprising that it failed Golarion continues to not look like gods are running the place or even talking to it a lot

Hes now got

3rd Unfamiliar divination unfamiliar divination unfamiliar conjuration
4th Unfamiliar abjuration

 at least there were no Illusion spells

If theres a message in whats left its not obvious to Keltham without knowing what other spells he has At least not unless he has to negotiate prices twice today Negotiate prices urgently Hurry up and negotiate a price on info already

Or They would otherwise cheat you if you didnt have this spell worry more about being cheated

Should he tap himself with the spell thats probably Early Judgment no actually he shouldnt do that until hes around somebody with a Dispel Keltham doesnt think It doesnt have to be Early Judgment Keltham doesnt need to say that he already suspects what the spell does

Keltham thinks Not just about spells He has queued things to think about

Carissa wakes up again to her own internal clock which is lots better than waking to the Queen of Cheliax evaluating whether to petrify you forever Shes mostly not thinking about that Its shell just stop being able to do her job if she dwells on it too much

She gets dressed and takes her Evil Bag of Holding and goes to check in

Sometimes Maillol wishes that priests also actually needed sleep in order to prepare spells

Sevar he says not permitting any trace of fatigue to enter his voice

Im soliciting correction or advice if you have any

Going to need additional context Sevar My superiors seemed relatively pleased by your performance mostly because nobody could figure out how any more competent seducer couldve gotten more success on Keltham What you did shouldnt have worked and the fact that it did is suggestive that conventional methods wouldnt have

Specifics Sigh Her Majesty wanted to know what Id do if Aspexia Rugatonn told me that Asmodeus wanted the Queen killed From where Im standing it looks like all possible answers to that question are at least one of heresy or treason but if theres actually some standard answer thatd be great to know

Thats our Infernal Majestrix all right The answer in real life is that its not the real Aspexia Rugatonn or I suppose Aroden returned from the dead and got the drop on her with mind control For Asmodeus to move His clerics against her Infernal Majestrix would violate His pact with House Thrune

Thats so soothingly not heretical or treasonous Thank you She also gave me this Bag of Holding and said that I may heal the injuries after I use it Do you know what it does Am I intended to use it

Even if I did know Sevar I wouldnt tell you if the Queen didnt If the Queen wants it to be a surprise its a surprise

I expect the Queen told you the bag contains something you want besides just pain If so I expect she expects you to try it and that she will re evaluate her impression of your courage if you dont This should be obvious Sevar and I have not had so much sleep in the last two days that you should try my patience

No one showed up in your bedroom to threaten you with nonexistence Carissa wants to snap back but for all she knows they did and anyway theres no point in arguing that she has justification for being bad at things the project doesnt care Do you have the books on Taldor

Youd think the Imperial Ministry of Historical Accuracy would have enough writers to get one fictional history written in a day if they split up by sections Turns out Weve got a mysterious truth detecting outsider on our hands and your fictional history needs not to read as obviously false to it from directions that none of us even understand is not a request that their previous careers have prepped them to handle

What I have for you instead are the three best actual books on Taldor that could be located And a ten page outline of the rough course of pseudo Cheliax since fifteen years ago all of which had to be produced by Inner Ring people not worried about getting executed for heresy if their entire story wasnt just about the flawless excellence of Hell and House Thrune Were working on finding some way to get the rest of your book written by less important people Security outside your room has both items

Thats probably enough for us to work off for today I should see drafts Ill notice some things that read false to Keltham that other people wont I am surprised that its not broadly believed someone better at seducing people wouldve been better at seducing him is it 

 uh am I importantly wrong about some of the things I told him that I wasnt even lying about

One Im afraid youll have to be more specific Two Are you sure you want to be more specific given that your mistakes seem to be playing excellently to Keltham and that you are still basically an Asmodean and bringing him closer to our Lord Asmodeus made that your call Sevar it was very distinctly not left to me or even Rugatonn to decide

still basically an Asmodean stings even though Asmodeus chose her and she already knows it was partially because shes doing theological innovation far above her previous station She tries very hard not to use that as an input into what to say 

Kelthams going to have the other girls too and if Im doing something wildly unlikely then theyre not going to do it and thats going to go badly And I dont think we can put that off very long though we could probably do a week if we have to If you think my ignorance of this is really important to preserve we can have someone else brief the group on Carissa errors they should pick up but they wont know how I got to the errors and thats a substantial black box Im working around if theres nothing significant enough that itd come up in advising the other girls then I guess those things can go uncorrected for now

What are Sevars actual heresies Maillol cant easily count them

Most centrally Sevar believes that Asmodeanism is about making everyone ultimately better off which is the central example of propaganda that gets fed to the Outers and that the Inners know better than to believe Lots of Outers know better on some level they just know that theyll die if they say it out loud or even if their thoughts are too honest about it producing a kind of pseudo belief that shreds apart words from wordless knowledge an inner disintegrity that is then useful for many further ends in molding people and probably aesthetically pleasing to Asmodeus as well though its hard to be sure with gods

Maillol does not think the time has come to drop that particular enlightenment on Sevar She has had too little taste of privilege and power she is too close emotionally to Lawful Neutrality and too exposed to Kelthams contrary examples

Sevar thinks that Cheliaxs tyranny is painful in part because the pain is educational and necessary and ultimately beneficial to the people being punished She thinks Hell is painful in part because that pain is necessary to produce the useful and refined beings that Asmodeus desires as tools

Maillol is not sure when if ever shell be ready to hear that the cruelty is the point You get told that either after youve sold your soul or after Asmodeus has chosen you as a cleric 

Maillol doesnt think he should just refuse to answer either

Sexually you seem to have acquired the idea that it would be right for Keltham to do as he wished with you once you gave yourself to him On conventional Asmodeanism one would say that it is right for Keltham to do as he wishes with you because he has the power to get away with it within a lawful system that offers you no defense Keltham could come by that power because the Church told you to be obedient because Asmodeus and his greater slaves like myself gave you to him to do with as he pleases or because some girl was born into slavery to her slave parents and Keltham bought her and decided to enjoy strangling her in bed

Dont misunderstand this as critique of the strategy you ended up executing Sevar Telling him that it was okay because you consented was an excellent move He wouldnt have gone for it otherwise and hes just starting out with his first tentative steps away from his Lawful Good society

But the fact that you believe what you told Keltham seems to have more to do with certain bizarre personal hangups of yours about events in countries that arent even Cheliax Right now Sevar the number one person most likely to drag you off to a bedroom and do as they will with you is the Queen of Cheliax who is not to the best of my knowledge male and has no doubt killed any number of men after making good use of them Whether any of them consented is utterly irrelevant to her souls standing with Asmodeus Shes the Queen of Cheliax Theres no recourse from her no appeal no court she doesnt just have the power to do what she wants with you she has the legal right which is the difference between Evil and Lawful Evil Then for her to take what she wants from you if she happens to want it is the most natural and Asmodean thing in the world

That you think its more Asmodean from the Queens perspective if you happen to have consented if you happen to have given yourself to her is the heretical part Maybe its more Asmodean for you if you become a willing slave to the one who hurts you a shadow of how it will be in Hell It is not more Asmodean for the Queen to think that it becomes more right if she has your consent That will not be what Asmodeus is thinking when you come to Him in Hell

The obvious endgame on seducing Keltham would be to lure him deeper into sadism and domination with this talk about consent and then lure him further to the point where he feels that he has the right to make use of somebody who hasnt consented to him at all and does that That will be the point that he starts to detect as Lawful Evil and be bound for our Lords Hell

And Sevar This is not a male versus female thing Asmodeus really really doesnt give two shits about that Youve met our Queen You should already know better

 I understand Thank you I think I can get Keltham there if we dont ruin everything in the next month before Ive had time

Maillol reaches into his desk and then pauses because he has a feeling he needs to get this part of the conversation done earlier in order for them to happen at all because Sevar is about to be distracted

If youre looking for somewhere to open the Queens gift Sevar try the torture chamber on the right theres no torturer currently on duty there and the junior priest stationed outside has healing spells Though doing that right away may come at the expense of being able to prepare spells before youre scheduled to brief the other girls in the morning depending on how elaborate the Queens gift turns out to be

Its also been suggested to me that you Sevar had to buy your own intelligence headband because requisitions was being weirdly obstructionist about it and gave you a two week delivery time The one you purchased will on this version arrive with the next delivery we get later today You say that where the girls and Keltham can hear Then somebody possibly Ione should mention to Keltham the wild but unlikely theory that the delay is because theyre planning to prepare cursed intelligence headbands which exist just like cursed versions of most other magic items exist and in particular have been famously known to do subtle influences and mind control and even make people dumber on certain subjects without realizing it Its not impossible that they had at least one cursed headband lying around to substitute for the one you bought to slip it to you immediately The point being that Keltham shouldnt just ask to borrow your headband from you though thats in any case something that wizards tend to be really fucking insane about

Those are lies to Keltham though except for that very last part so your final call The suggester wasnt in our chain of command

 probably a good idea Or someone can suggest that the delay is because you have to check if theyre subtly cursed and then Keltham can generate for himself the hypothesis that we might be doing that deliberately

Right well thats basically what he had to say to Sevar or it had better have been because now hes not going to get anything sensible from her for a while Maillol reaches again into his desk and offers Sevar the intelligence headband

He wishes it was possible to actually curse the things with some subtle maleficent voice whispering to wizards to not be so insane about intelligence headbands

 blah blah blah Carissa is a good Asmodean her only motivation is to be a less imperfect slave

She puts it on

Shes felt it before of course she has Foxs Cunning and uses it sometimes when shes stuck on a spell structure or on how to get an enchantment to lay nicely Its wonderful it feels like the difference between being groggily half awake and being properly awake except on top of awakeness It feels like the sort of conversation you have with another person where each of you sees exactly where the other is going so you get three words into a sentence and the other person says eagerly yes and you can move on to the next piece having placed a conceptual pointer except with just one person 

Right now its mostly just making it harder to refocus her attention away from the Queens threat to petrify her Which is silly The threat made sense Carissa is glad to live in a country where Queens issue such threats because contemplating their overthrow really is a very grave crime and if there were no penalty more serious than more quickly meeting Asmodeus then more people would do it and that wouldnt do Carissa understood this incentive problem to mostly be solved with a very very protracted death but she can appreciate why the Queen would have assessed Carissas own incentives as being different And very simple 

And shes not going to overthrow the Queen because she isnt an idiot so its fine Except that it seems like there are actually a lot of ways that Carissa could fail from here in ways that made people very angry at her and 

 its always been true that shell go to Hell no matter what

 digression why does Maillol think that the Queen might want to have sex with her Why would the Queen want that Should Carissa want the Queen to want that She leans no because being around the Queen more feels like it makes it more likely one ends up a statue underground Maybe if she has succeeded tremendously at her project and built dath ilan but evil and better If that happens probably she will not end up a statue underground

The Queen could be bluffing Asmodeus has chosen Carissa perhaps He wouldnt tolerate that There was no hint of it in her voice or manner but then there wouldnt be

Okay setting that aside with more mental effort than it ought to take but not more than she has on hand

The Queen implied that Asmodeus instructed Cheliax to let Keltham go when he leaves Which makes sense of why Contessa Lrilatha was willing to concede that in contract negotiations it was commanded already Why did Asmodeus give those instructions The Queens right that Keltham isnt a relative advantage for Cheliax at all if no one can learn his teachings without ending up a heretic That seems really important to understand Shes not coming up with anything but its standing out now in her memory as a question along with why isnt Abadar talking to Keltham and is Otolmens right to think Keltham might end the world and how badly do I have to screw up to get turned into a statue 

Queens present before she gives the Taldor briefing or after Carissa kind of wants to be in a lot of pain right now so that settles that 

Thank you she says perfunctorily to Maillol and goes off to the torture chamber

The priest on duty nods at her as she goes by apparently unconfused or just uninterested as to why shes going into the torture chamber by herself

Carissa has been in torture chambers before on both sides of the restraints This one is much smaller than the one youd find in a larger temple with stations for only two prisoners and one torturer and its fancier and better decorated with glaring crimson mood lighting because its in the temple built into the private summer villa of an archduke But aside from that it looks like a very ordinary and conventional torture chamber in an Asmodean temple

The bag is quite small even for a Holding bag You could fit your hand into how large it appears to be if you tried though the Queen did say it triggered just on being opened and not with sticking your hand in

Well if she gets blood all over her clothes theres magic for that She sits down and opens her present

Which hand

Left she doesnt need it to write Though shes going to heal it anyway

As the bag comes halfway open it leaps up around Carissas left hand over her wrist snapping tight

Most sexual masochists prefer a gradual buildup of their pain This bag is the opposite of that as if somebody was trying to make the experience unpleasant even for a masochist maybe as a challenge

Torture details spoilered
Molten iron heat on her index finger instantly there from zero buildup lasting for maybe a quarter minute and then it cuts out and is replaced by the sensation of her middle finger being flayed which goes on for another quarter minute

Its probably not actually molten iron real molten iron would burn out nerves quickly and end up feeling mostly like the pain of an amputation

Carissa screams Rich people soundproof their torture chambers usually and even if they didnt the church while doing a secret operation certainly would but she wouldnt actually be able to do anything different if this were going to give away everything to Keltham 

It is decided Carissa does NOT want to have sex with the Queen of Cheliax

Good girl whispers Abrogail Thrunes voice into Carissas ear seductiveness backed by vast Splendour Go ahead scream more Let it all out

Torture details spoileredThe flaying cuts out Needles of cold far below the freezing point of water stab into her thumb This time its only five seconds before her pinky gets dipped into boiling acid with the cold still stabbing at her thumb

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH is Abrogail Thrune somehow personally listening How Why Doesnt she have a country to run Is this even informative about anything maybe its a test about whether Carissa will try to draw her hand out of the bag but shes not an idiot and that obviously wouldnt work Shes glad it wouldnt work otherwise shed in fact find it really hard not to

The bag goes on treating Carissas hand to a variety of different extreme unpleasantnesses switching faster and faster as the bag continues its work as though trying to deliberately avert someones ability to lean into the pain and come to any kinds of terms with it This is not a bag of pain this is a bag of suffering

Thrunes voice continues to whisper seductive encouragement Depending on how much spare brainpower Carissa has admittedly with her intelligence headband she may note that at no point does the voice address her as Sevar rather than just you

At the end Thrunes voice whispers to her that she can claim her reward now Thrune doesnt want to discourage girls from being good and that if she would like to try this again before sending the bag back to the palace at the end of the day it can be recharged by any sixth circle wizard

The bag comes off Carissas wrist and falls to the floor now open to the fading sound of Thrunes seductive laughter

Carissa spends a couple of minutes on the floor trembling and sobbing and restraining herself from vomiting Thats without looking at her hand which shes pretty sure will set her off again 

Well Shes not going to worry anymore about pushing Keltham into being more intense than she cant handle She is not sure if thats what the Queen was aiming at or if she just thinks its funny 

Shes pretty sure that asking for the bag to be recharged so she can do it again would be flirting with the Queen which she should not do But who turns down a challenge from the Queen of Cheliax to prove yourself intense enough She will definitely regret that Down that path lies statues which is a different kind of thought than down that path lies horrible pain Down her own path lies horrible pain She knows that She should expect many days in Hell that are like that even if shes a very promising student because there are things you can only learn that way She genuinely doesnt think its the fact that that was the most AWFUL FIVE MINUTES OF HER LIFE or however long it was is the reason shes not asking to do it again 

When the pain and nausea have subsided enough she can breathe evenly she looks at her hand

Its a wreck but the kind of wreck that can be handled by a medium strength cleric not a Regeneration spell

Okay

Carissas just going to 

 right her spellsilver Shes going to get her spellsilver out of the bag Very carefully

Theres spellsilver in the bag some regular silver gold foil tiny rubies two packets of sapphire dust and Chelish currency Somebody with a great deal of Splendour has very accurately guessed how much of a reward needs to be in this bag for Carissa Sevar to feel even taking the torture into account that the Queen was doing her a favor on net and not just in a not killing or petrifying you way

 awwww Its kind of like cuddles The monetary equivalent of cuddles You can handle anything if afterwards someone will tell you youre very impressive and give you cuddles or spellsilver

She scoops it up and puts it into her breast pocket and then makes herself stand up and stagger to the door by promising herself there will be healing on the other side of it She looks godawful and shes well aware of it but theres probably time to put herself together before explaining the Taldor plan

The priest on duty doesnt raise an eyebrow just taps her hand with healing

Great Shell just put the bag in her pocket with the spellsilver for safekeeping splash some water on her face and fix her hair then

Shes still walking shakily but that ought to wear off

Security near her room will appear and deliver the Taldor books and the alt history outline to her

Excellent What has she got to work with

Taldor has been around for nearly a thousand years and has a civil war with brutal regularity at nearly every succession because the next Emperor is appointed technically by the Senate a vestigial body in the capital with no real influence except once every few decades when it is called upon to name the next Emperor The processes the Senate is supposed to follow are stunningly opaque and complex the word in Carissas language for excessively complicated stems from the capital city of Taldor and theres no mechanism by which the Senates rulings are enforced besides that they lend the named person a lot of credibility Needless to say that doesnt really work and peaceful successions are at this point practically the exception unfit or young Emperors have a tendency to be elevated only to swiftly die of it ruthless outsiders sometimes have a go until they misstep in the capital politics they dont understand and die the army is always cheerfully threatening to proclaim a general as emperor 

Emperors tried in various ways to secure a preferred successor naming a co emperor say but it was common for junior co emperors to be killed when their senior co emperor died or lost his foothold 

Taldor is mostly feudal but the Emperor appoints the rulers of some provinces directly and those military governors are supposed to be especially loyal to him and his enforcers if a fight is necessary Of course if you let your military governors accumulate too much power in their own right they might overthrow you Of course if you keep the people who concern you most close to home they might assassinate you 

Despite all this Taldor has remained a major global power mostly for two reasons firstly even its outlying fortresses are a thousand years old and nearly unassailable including by one another during civil wars and secondly Oppara itself is a magnificently walled and warded city and its said those walls will outlast the world Its lost some ground to Qadira and some to Galt but its still larger than Cheliax 

Kelthams going to be so offended about all of these things But theyll have whatever bizarre correlations theyre supposed to because Taldor is a real place that really exists Carissa speed reads some book and makes some notes on the outline and then goes to the library to present to her students 

As Carissa enters the room Pilar clears her throat from a lurking corner near the door and then hands Carissa a very nice looking piece of cake on an elaborate plate Surprise Pilar says This is your congratulations on seducing Keltham party Have some cake

Yeah thats incredibly weird Carissa is less than delighted 

For all you know I failed miserably she says taking the plate and setting it down on the nearest desk Perhaps in dath ilan they have entirely different anatomy and we both got horribly confused

Pilar says nothing just scurrying around to the nearest chair and perching there next to Paxti She doesnt quite look embarrassed about the whole thing more like she did it on somebody elses orders that she isnt going to argue with

All other girls present are giving her exactly as much of a strange look as youd expect in Cheliax which is to say its not at all dramatic or exaggerated but its definitely detectable to another Chelaxian

Carissa will just ignore that and move on

All right First on settling sadism bets the answer is yes Also do not propose a bet with Keltham because dath ilan has a deeply bizarre norm that the thing you bet during sex is nonreciprocal services which would otherwise naturally not be a thing because anything anyone does they should get something in return for Yes he thinks that still applies here where he has knowledge any government would slaughter cities for Yes I think its plausibly worth trying to convince him that Evil has more fun but youve got to be careful about it Ill give much more specific instruction to anyone who seems to be getting close to him but the essential bits are you want to be here its ridiculous that anyone would threaten or coerce you into being here if you didnt want to be you might be exceedingly transactional about your intentions towards Keltham but its your transaction that you expect to enrich you You can if youd like have one mean boyfriend who didnt treat you like that in your backstory especially if youve got hangups to explain but coordinate with me so you dont all do it I do not want people who are inexperienced with pain in bed or sexually inexperienced generally trying to let Keltham hit you were working with a narrative where some people really like that and most pain here or in Hell is because some people really like that and if youve obviously managed to talk yourself into it that has decent odds of coming out 

You are going to not lie to him about anything thats not essential I get transcripts I will light you on fire you will be grateful I did because otherwise my boss would have to do it and he has a longer attention span for it The key thing here is that Keltham notices different features of the world than us so we dont actually know all that much about how to lie convincingly to him So the less you force us to fit into the lie the easier our lives are Say I dont feel ready to talk about it say I should have learned that in class but it was the week my sister died so I wasnt paying attention say Im having a hard time putting it into words say can I recommend you a book I forget all the details myself You all want to show off by being competent but we will get more out of Keltham if we are weak flawed confused and therefore wouldnt be expected to have good answers to all of his questions He already thinks everyone in this world doesnt know how to think If you cant think of a true thing to say or an approved in story thing to say the thing to do is to let him believe that even harder 

Questions

Ione speaks first Shes recovered now something of the demeanor of a student among other students when she needs to play that role I already offered myself up to Keltham as somebody who would do anything he wants without asking anything in return Im not actually into pain but didnt take that off the menu at the time for obvious reasons I didnt represent myself as already experienced in service or as desiring him sexually if its important that I lie about neither of those things Further guidance

 I think that works fine as long as you keep not lying about those things Did he not immediately ask what you were getting in return

I represented myself as being willing to do it for the knowledge when I made the offer Ione smiles briefly she would be willing under entirely different circumstances

Paxtis shiny new arcane sight shows that the circlet Carissa now wears is a powerful magic item

Youve got an intelligence headband When do the rest of us 

Were going to delay it as long as we can because outmaneuvering smarter Kelthams going to be even harder maybe impossible Officially Acquisitions said itll be two weeks and I went ahead and ordered one myself which I can afford to do and you cant because Ive been earning a generous salary from Cheliax for my work at the Worldwound for six years and you havent The gossip is that this is because you know some intelligence headbands are cursed and even worse some are just a tiny bit cursed make you see things in a particular light and optimistically Acquisitions is making really sure the project headbands are good and pessimistically well they could be manufacturing them a little cursed Please attempt to have a little bit of subtlety in causing this gossip to reach Kelthams ears I actually suspect that only the optimistically part needs to be said and he is competent to fill in the rest 

Also we are going to be hiding a lot behind you guys not actually being all that well educated not actually knowing that much history or politics or economics because magical education in Cheliax is very specialized The smarter you are the harder it is for you to make innocent mistakes 

Keltham is under the impression you were screened for willingness to bear his children I think thats just true but if its not you now explicitly have permission to lie about it Keltham is under the impression you are getting generously paid I think thats just true because I have told everyone that were doing as few lies as possible but if its not you have permission to truthfully say I was told we would be generously paid and if the money isnt there Im going to go to whoevers in charge here and make a nuisance of myself and then to come to me and maybe to lie after that depending whats up Keltham is under the impression that if you didnt want to sleep with him no one would make you you have permission to lie to him about that but also if you find yourself getting cold feet in bed you wont actually be punished for telling Keltham wait I think actually Im not ready and I just want to cuddle because that presently advances our goals That said if Keltham ignores you about that that would be great news for the project and you should make sure he has a really pleasant time about it and ends up with the impression he was right to ignore you I strongly expect that if you try to tease him by getting him really turned on and then saying no hell just give you a hug and say its okay so if you are trying this route youre going to have to try something a lot subtler and cleverer than that and you should run it by me 

We arent telling him about the soul arrangements but if he somehow learns of it the line is that its normal for people in dangerous lines of work to arrange their afterlife in advance so they dont end up in Avernus in general processing and that as a bonus these business arrangements are hotly competed for among devils so a good negotiator can get some reasonably powerful magic out of making their afterlife arrangements But thats only if he somehow finds out I and some of your colleagues dont have arcane sight because our contractual arrangements were a bit different were still working out the best story for that so for today you should conceal having it 

Other things you are explicitly expected to lie to Keltham about who his god is Its going to be an obscure Tian one Whether all fourth circle clerics have a weaker personal aura should they differ from their god in alignment it doesnt come up much in Cheliax because it cant happen with an Asmodean cleric but youd expect they wouldnt Whether Cheliax is systematically concealing things Whether Hell involves involuntary torture

And of course everything to do with the character of Cheliax as a nation Were going to be pretending that Cheliax is Taldor

And she explains her reasoning again and explains the key outlines from the fake timeline and from the books about Taldor 

At this time Ill take questions but my plan is actually for you to spend the rest of the morning learning enough about Taldor that you can be a magic tracked shut in who plausibly lived there

So Ive been thinking begins Paxti and I realize it was just a book but I dont see any reason why the plot of The Damnation of Sir Nicolau wouldnt work in real life if the target was Keltham instead of a paladin Only with a series of different girls rather than one woman with a disguise amulet First girl obligate fetish for being forced requires him to role play forcing her but she asks him to do that in advance Second girl loudly remarks about how she cant achieve sexual satisfaction without being forced and it doesnt work for her if she has to explain it to the man and we all explain to Keltham what shes hinting and encourage him and note how she never said she didnt want it he tries it it seems to go well for him Third girl always staring in fascination while thats going on but looks away blushing and cant seem to talk about it Fourth girl acts angry but in a way thats obviously sending mixed signals Fifth girl is straight angry at first but warms up once shes pinned down Sixth girl begs him to stop and acts overtly horrified but by that time hes so used to it always being a pose that wait I skipped one in the sequence in the book there were seven 

In the book Sir Nicolau damned himself on the sixth disguise but she kept going to be sure they ended up in the same depth of Hell together after she killed him and herself corrects Ione not that Im agreeing this is the slightest bit workable as an idea If Keltham is a sadist then dath ilan has sadists and his world will have romance novels and he will notice that we are running the stereotypical plot of a romance novel on him

 Romance novels approved and distributed by the Chelish government may not accurately represent exactly which sexual behaviors first produce alignment shift

Dath ilan actually discourages its sadists from noticing because Keltham thinks they havent got people who like pain and they havent got any other outlets aside from paying people a ton of money for it which I think wouldnt even be as fun But I do think hell notice if were running the plot of a romance novel on him its too you wouldnt expect to run across those people in that order unless something was up And unless youre very good at faking sexual reactions hell notice what youre actually into dath ilan does train that skill Also Keltham has in common with paladins that in real life the biggest barrier to seducing them is them endlessly going I dont want to risk you having a child I couldnt take proper responsibility for I think theres no point trying to convince Keltham that thats Good I get the sense dath ilan has lots of children related taboos which we should mostly just try to steer very far clear of relatedly youre not allowed to point out to him that he could use magic to make you have an abortion 

That said if anyone does have a convenient fetish for being forced that seems valuable And once hes had some time to adjust we might be able to work with having threesomes where one girl forces the other and if Keltham objects both of them are like were having a great time here

I have the convenient fetish not obligate but would be easy to pretend it is reports Pilar 

Unlikely to actually be sexually attracted to Keltham under any circumstances will need training to fake it if he had training to detect it says Asmodia after some inward agonizing about how to phrase this in a way that doesnt sound like shes being noncompliant

It might be good if attraction to Keltham is not represented as universal for plausibility reasons Maybe just tell him you take a long time to develop attraction though and put some effort into learning to fake it so that if its convenient later we have the option Pilar I authorize you to lie and claim its obligate as seems situationally appropriate Carissa is trying to be VERY SERIOUS about authorized lies to Keltham only in case that helps people break the habit of habitually lying about everything 

Paxti and Ione seem to have developed their own sub conversation

Adventure of Ameron Paxti says

I dont think any of us can convincingly fake being half sea creature retorts Ione Ill concede you could come closer than many

I meant metaphorically never mind A Girl Corrupted By Books but with Keltham as the girl

Fine except for the part where the outcome is the exactly precise opposite of what we want

Im not suggesting we run the entire plot Im suggesting that in real life it would inevitably go wrong for Keltham and then wed get what we want Perverting Adan

That is literally the worst idea Ive ever heard It violates 

Now both of their hair is on fire Just a little bit of fire a cantrip of fire if theyre good at patting out fires it wont even burn their hands We dont have much time before Keltham is done preparing spells and you all need to spend it becoming familiar with Taldor Are there any more questions

None that any dare speak aloud

Great Keltham has no reason to think I have any authority here and you will lie about that if he asks Lets all sit together and read about our history

They scatter to desks but even with more than one girl to a book theres not enough books for girls Id offer to grab another copy of Taldorian Chronicles from Ostenso but Keltham knows I can do five a day and he might ask where the first one went Ione notes It sounds like hed accept my saying that I reserve a book use per day for personal reading but thats a lie so Im checking it

Yes you can say that if it comes up

Ione briefly goes into the librarys other room and returns with an additional copy of the Chronicles Shes curious about whether anyone else here has been told the full story about her yet but shes not going to ask

When you run across something thats interesting or memorable or especially anything surprising anything that wouldnt be true of Cheliax share it

And they can get to reading about Taldor Carissas so glad she doesnt live in Taldor It sounds like a tedious undirected nest of snakes

Shortly after Keltham is done praying theres a knock on his door

Keltham shall accordingly go to the door and open it

Its a man of about 40 wearing glasses Keltham Im ah a researcher studying minor and geographically bounded deities at the University of Westcrown and I was asked yesterday to figure out uh which god you are probably a cleric of I have the report here would you like me to leave it or stay and explain it

I wish I could say Ill no doubt understand the entire thing on my own but this is not in fact the case I can read through it first unless you think its better to preface it with something

No go right ahead He hands Keltham eight handwritten pages bound together with thread I can wait in one of the sitting rooms

Sure Keltham takes and reads leaving his door open

The researchers best guess is that its the Lawful Neutral deity Yaezhing worshipped in a small coastal country in distant Tian Xia He has copied from other texts some pictures of Yaezhings symbols and theyre not a perfect match for the illusion that appears on peoples foreheads when Keltham casts his fairness spells but theyre not far off and its noted that these are from adventure memories by Avistani adventurers who passed through the country so the likeliest explanation for the mismatch is poor recollection One of the adventure memoirs claims confidently that Yaezhing is Lawful Evil but that memoir has a number of errors

For completeness hes also included some other symbols that are approximately as good a match with notes on why the relevant deities were disqualified this symbol is a good match but the god is a nature god who usually takes the form of volcanos and doesnt pick clerics This symbol is an acceptable match but the god is a Chaotic Evil demon lord of the Abyss best known for the time he led a bloody campaign to wipe out all the descendants of Azlant This symbol is associated with an ancient Azlant god thought to be dead And then gods without symbols but which otherwise seem like good matches Kofusachi is attested to have truth telling and trading spells which is incredibly promising but hes Chaotic Good his domain is something like abundance and the state of resources where they are so plentiful one neednt be bothered to charge for them Possibly hes hoping Keltham will bring that state to Golarion No symbols similar to Kelthams are attested but a page of further information on him has been included all the same Abadar is a Lawful Neutral god of commerce but his symbols are extremely well known theyre these and his first and second circle spells offered to his clerics are also well known theyre spells for ship navigation and preventing goods from rotting Just in case he stopped by a church of Abadar in Westcrown to ask if Abadar has a lesser known aspect or associations with this symbol but they didnt recognize either the symbol or the spell 

With that established heres all that is known about Yaezhing Its not very much One of the memoirs has only a single passage copied in full into the report it claims that the people of this small coastal country live in great prosperity despite their lack of fertile land for their god grants them freely knowledge of truth and so they all trust each other and trade fairly and mock the peoples of larger cities who by necessity trust no one and must stand watch at night against thieves One of the others gives Yaezhings divine realm Setsendu in Axis and a domain of his as Justice the third is the one that claims Yaezhing is Evil and that Setsendu is in Hell but agrees that Justice is a domain of his as are Cooperation and Trust Idols of him are drawn with bulging eyes a long face and a red beard but thats indicative of practically nothing especially with the gods that arent ascended humans There are vanishingly few books on him in Avistan the author says hes reached out unsuccessfully to other libraries and theres probably mentions buried in some of their books but itll take a long time to find them

And the page on Kofusachi just in case its actually Him somehow Chaotic Good god of prosperity and abundance mentions meticulously copied not very detailed of trading and truth telling spells primarily worshipped in Tianjing called The Laughing God holy symbol is reportedly a string of seven coins

Keltham reads through it all slowly theres a lot of unfamiliar terms here and he is more than usually on the lookout for things that dont make sense That Golarion itself does not make much sense is the central problem there but still Keltham is looking and noticing the many small confusions

Kofusachi Has the trading and truth spells Doing coordination correctly could look Chaotic to the locals if theres a norm a single uniform way of doing things that isnt correct coordination The god of coordination could look like Good if say good general levels of social coordination are a public good and public goods are what everyone unselfishly wants everyone else to have The god of coordination could be mistaken for a god of prosperity and abundance if people didnt understand what was producing the prosperity and abundance

Yaezhing If theres gaslighting going on then Yaezhing is obviously the god they want him to believe in Yaezhing hasnt had much impact on his people for being the god of coordination but then coordination isnt quite the same concept as industry and no god anywhere has granted Golarion real technology and science

 he knows too little of gods to know which parts are confusing because theyre fiction and which parts are truth that confuses the alien with the wrong priors

Keltham will keep this document obviously and later check it against other archival type writings to see if a noticeable difference of style between other archived writings and these supposedly variously sourced writings suggests a LARP writing team having frantically produced them overnight

Also the words Good Evil Lawful and Chaotic are repeated often enough for Keltham to notice that the person who granted him Share Language Taldane last night probably had a slightly different concept of those terms than Carissa Good seems innocent naive an object of a kind of contempt that has little currency in dath ilan Carissas Good sounded more like dangerous fanatics out to optimize you even if you tell them not to Evil feels like it has undertones of power and sadism in a way that seems reminiscent of some things Carissa said in the cuddleroom but in a sort of creepy icky gloating status laden way Lawful has undertones a lot like Evil Chaotic sounds like dangerous insanity and wild predators The connotations are subtle and hard to describe the connotations already hammered into Kelthams brain yesterday are competing with them He already knows those words of Taldane or his brain thinks it does

Keltham goes hunting for the scholar finding him in a nearby sitting room

I hope its not too much of a surprise or an imposition if I say that most of what I need to understand this is background material Keltham says For one thing I was previously under the impression there were a lot fewer gods than this seems to imply and that they were all global rather than regional entities What are the numbers like in total

We dont know There are fourteen gods with well established churches on this continent most of them also have presence in Tian Xia Then there are dozens maybe hundreds of more minor entities that create only a few clerics at a time Those are often geographically bounded possibly just because if their gods are small they cant pay attention to a very large share of the plane We believe there are many gods who never pick clerics Gods are sort of only a human category anyway for entities that can cleric us Pharasma and say Yaezhing are going to be very different entities Its said that there are things next to which Pharasma is small and we are preserved because theyre not paying attention but no one has any proof beyond visions they had

What does it mean that Yaezhing is a geographically bounded god

Keltham is trying one of the first Deliberately Deceptive Maneuvers hes done outside of Diplomacy LARPs Assuming The Premise Keltham has noticed confusion about Yaezhing being Tian only and mainly about a small coastal country because smaller gods cant pay attention widely and that god managing to pick up his prayer in Cheliax Rather than asking explicitly about this and giving the scholar a chance to correct an unintended implication of a lie Keltham is instead asking how Yaezhing is bounded rather than whether Yaezhing is bounded

Aspexia Rugatonn needed to check over Cayden Caileans oracle anyways

As long as she has to visit goes the reasoning she might as well visit Keltham right after he gets morning spells and run Spell Gauge over him to avoid further surprises

As long as shes doing that she might as well use her personal Detect Thoughts tool which adopts the users strength for purposes of determining Will saves of the target on Keltham

Aspexia informs the agent of what Keltham is trying She doesnt bother explaining whos sending the message the agent doesnt need the distraction Also somebody had better have been on the ball about matching writing styles very perfectly with real archives or else theyre going to have to fake all the other archives Keltham ever looks at

Generally a geographically bounded gods interventions happen within a specific region and most of their attention is allocated there To pick a geographically bounded god we know more about Mazludeh is the goddess of sacrifice and stewardship Neutral Good Shes active in Holomog a country south of here She tends to have about twelve clerics at a time most of them selected when they first visit one of her temples in Holomog on some occasions shes chosen someone elsewhere but always someone who had been near her clerics when they travelled suggesting that Her attention was following their cleric Ive written to the Worldwound to ask if Yaezhings priests are there right now as thats the likeliest mechanism our representative there didnt know offhand but they probably are Even small Lawful countries usually send a couple of representatives to the Worldwound on general principle Or Yaezhing might not be a geographically bounded god at all Our references are too limited to be sure

Keltham notes down this exact response to his unspoken question as a slight bit of evidence that theyre reading his mind or talking to devils smart enough to model it eerily perfectly but its only slight evidence if Keltham can think of it so can they Keltham supposes There hasnt been very much other evidence of his hosts reading his mind not counting Lrilatha seeming to know exactly how to talk to him and Lrilatha is a more plausible big special case

I would have expected more for there to be a systematic compendium of entities that have clerics if theres only a few hundred of them and especially entities with clerics at the Worldwound Keltham says Any simple way of getting a count on all the Lawful Neutral gods with clerics there or even asking them all for a one paragraph summary of what their gods are about It is really bizarre to Keltham that info like this has not already been collected

Aspexia isnt out of range yet she warns the agent to be more careful with using information from subjects who dont know mind reading exists

Noted Hed be much more panicked if he knew who was talking to him We have a list of all the churches that are signatories to the treaty For a list more comprehensive than that theres not really a way to get one The Worldwound is a hundred miles across the perimeter is therefore 650 There are three hundred forty four different heavily warded fortresses on the perimeter Eighty one of them are ours and we host some foreign adventurers and probably have records of any weird clerics whove stayed at one of our fortresses But the Tian nations are mostly on the other side and its not traversable except by teleport and civilians arent really welcome so youd have to convince some of the soldiers to do it

People can count to 344 If you divide up the work among 43 people they only need to census 8 fortresses apiece

Keltham doesnt pursue this further though it matches too much other strangely missing competence to seem relatively anomalous He just needs to keep better track of whether the incompetence tends to get in the way of anything that might possibly maybe incentivize him to be anywhere but Cheliax

Sorry for even more basic questions but remind me of how many hours or days of unskilled labor it takes to buy a teleport to the Worldwound from Tian Does the basic picture on international trade even make sense here

 in Cheliax itll run you 1400gp which is twenty unskilled labor years double that for a round trip I dont know Tian prices and they probably vary a lot country to country by how many high level wizards there are and by how far you are from the Worldwound a single teleport can only travel up to about 1000miles it varies by caster circle so that price reflects needing two Teleports In say Irrisen you can do it in one jump so the price is probably around half that not that Ive been to Irrisen

Okay it taking twenty labor years just to get him here from the Worldwound is not actually a thing that Keltham had previously known was the case He supposes that degree of scarcity rhymes with Carissa saying that a thousand people are the countrys effective real military power Golarions economy is insane like not literally inconsistent with itself but it is going to go on being really weird until Keltham figures out the internal rhythm that makes all the different facts be predictable from premises smaller than themselves Also his implied startup debt is bigger than he thought and he should be less worried about adding small bits to it and more worried about paying back the startup debt sooner

Excuse me a second recalculating entire probable state of all international trade Keltham says absently

When Keltham is done Have you ever heard of a Lawful Neutral god that tries to prevent giant messes disasters

No I mean lots of them probably do but Ive never heard of one who had that specifically in their portfolio Which means they dont openly have a church in Cheliax or any of our neighbors

Worth a shot but either hes been warned off answering or the Broomgod really is that secretive

What factors control how when and where clericing entities can communicate with or influence clerics

I think the general consensus about gods is that they are primarily constrained by treaty with one another and by very general resource constraints so they can do most things but some things are very costly and some things theyve promised not to A smaller god would be more resource constrained and the Lawful gods are more treaty constrained

Im really hoping for a lot more detail than that All the other facts along the lines of they can see where their clerics go so can use that to pick new clerics Has anyone measured the distance a cleric can move away before a god stops hearing prayers directed at them from nonclerics nearby the cleric Does it vary with other measurables about the god that you can use to infer a central strength factor with which both cleric sight distance and other factors vary

 no

the number one thing that is IMPLAUSIBLE about this place is how much supposedly NOBODY HAS EVER TRIED TO FIGURE OUT ANYTHING IMPORTANT but nobody would LIE using THAT LIE they would make up FAKE DATA so it didnt look like AN ENDLESS STREAM OF HIDDEN INFORMATION and maybe they are playing one ply deeper than him and KNOW THIS IS HOW HELL FEEL and WANT HIM TO FEEL THIS CONFUSED but nonetheless AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH

Keltham gives up on subtlety if that was what somebody was hoping for they have gauged him perfectly My god cant seem to contact me I can tell they want to I can tell they cant whats going wrong and how do I fix it

 huh Possibilities theres some treaty prohibiting them from doing so If there is I dont know anything about it They are a localized god and youre too far away for them to do something as costly as that They dont know how to talk to mortals without overwriting their brain Nethys is known to have that problem

Overwriting 

Ione says a part of himself in sudden horror

Does that destroy their mind state Overwrite their soul nothing left for the afterlife but a copy or a fragment of Nethys

He did it a couple of times thousands of years ago when He was a new god and then stopped We have records of how the people all went irretrievably insane including when dead but we dont know very many details on the nature of the irretrievable insanity And now He drops levels on people but doesnt talk to them Hes an extreme case but Asmodeus also doesnt ever talk directly to mortals He communicates to devils who then attempt to translate for us

Who else doesnt talk directly to mortals What do Asmodeus and Nethys have in common

I think most of the gods that arent ascended humans talk to mortals rarely if at all the gods that ascended via the Starstone are Norgorber Iomedae Aroden and Cayden Cailean and the general understanding is that theyre better at talking to mortals because they can use an internal copy of their mortal mind as an interface of sorts Nethys is also technically said to be an ascended human god but His ascension process was different and drove Him mad reportedly And then there are scattered other ex mortals Irori Lawful Neutral who ascended through attaining perfection Erecura a Lawful Neutral god of secrets and soothsayers and the Queen of Dis in Hell Milani Chaotic Good goddess of bloody revolutions

Remind me of the alignments and interests of the Starstoners Keltham remembers that Norgorber is the god of crime but was pretending not to be carefully memorizing that at the time

Norgorber Neutral Evil god of crime Iomedae Lawful Good god of fighting Evil particularly Abaddon and the Worldwound and Zon Kuthon but Shes not best friends with us either Cayden Cailean Chaotic Good god of drink uh of mind altering substances and freedom and adventure Aroden dead Lawful Neutral god of colonization and population growth sometimes glossed as god of humanity because He was strongly in favor of more of us

Oh right Ive been told not everyone here is human Which did seem potentially kinda important especially the species that supposedly couldnt interbreed with humans and might therefore be actual different species instead of heritably shapechanged humans But there were just too many important things at once and Keltham didnt want to interrupt his lesson to ask Who are the nonhuman ascended gods Could those gods talk to humans after they ascended

Uh the elves have their own pantheon I dont think it has any ascended former elves in it Milani was a half elf There is a god who is an ascended rat Lao Shu Po but Ive never heard of anyone successfully talking to Her Sarenraes an ascended angel but She doesnt directly talk to Her followers She sends heralds

How did the rat manage that This drastically contradicts my fragile picture of how I thought anything did or possibly could work

Ours too I do not know the answer to that question The conventional one is that She ate the corpse of a Tian god and thereby ascended but thats hardly more satisfying

Keltham spends more time attempting to acquire knowledge and debug his current theological problems sort of losing track of time actually not least because he does not have a wristwatch or any other means of keeping time and taking away a dath ilanis wristwatch when theyre already in the middle of asking Additional Questions is sort of like yanking the breathing tube out of somebody who already wasnt breathing

He acquires a slightly better and still incredibly confusing picture of Golarion theology with certain selective omissions and alterations

And it absorbs lots of time which is good because hopefully downstairs everyone is all briefed on Taldor 

No plan survives first contact with the enemy but theyre as prepared as they can be

What do you mean its already lunchtime Somebody should have informed Keltham before this Now he doesnt have time to prioritize his remaining Additional Questions and ask those before he has to go Oh no has Carissa been waiting patiently in her bedroom for him to show up and get his shirt laundered this whole time

This researcher doesnt know that but he can take letters if Keltham thinks of further questions

Carissa even had enough time to prepare spells and shes delighted about it She prepared the ones for the Improbable Escape mostly Shes sitting alone by the window in the dining room looking through a book about The Year of Four Kings from when Taldor and Cheliax were unified that they decided didnt require any modification

Good morning well not morning any more but same essential principle

Its morning somewhere is it all right with you if I convey the information needed to settle the sadism bets which is just yes or no or should I not do that it occurred to me this morning that you might have privacy intuitions or something

Oh yeah its fine I mean maybe run it past me before you release exact details of what we did together not saying no just saying not sure how Id feel but the general fact is fine

Carissa gives a table across the room a thumbs up There are giggles Im not planning to say anything else she assures him I dont quite understand the whole concept of spoilers but that seems like it might fall under it

Keltham tries a new question gets a surprising internal blip Though if its not somebody planning on sleeping with me at some point actually I seem to have emotional reservations about you telling all of the exact details to Security and Governance But Im also aware that this may not be reasonable or the most important consideration So maybe ask me if they need all the exact details and I can decide in more detail what to feel about it Also happy about routing it to any entities with no sexuality but dont assume thats necessary if its incredibly expensive

That describes lots of devils but theyre probably pretty expensive yeah I dont think they should need the exact details rather than broad things like no Im not pregnant no you dont have such extremely narrow tastes that we need to start a nationwide search If they ask more than that Ill ask you

Keltham knows he is probably supposed to find something flirtatious to say but his mind is coming up blank and its still blank and it goes on being blank and finally Keltham gives up and says Well for whatever its worth your attractiveness remains a stable aspect of yourself between yesterday and today Oh and Ive got the notes for some of the sexual questions and topics I managed not to talk about while we were in the middle of fucking But I probably shouldnt hand all of those to you right now should probably be more of an evening thing

For notes on sexual questions I can make some time in my busy evening schedule Anyway Ill have a headband by then maybe itll make me better at explaining things

Oh thats good news Project resources coming through

No actually I tromped over to Acquisitions this morning once it seemed like you were occupied and asked what the delay is and they were still like eh couple of weeks we dont think itd be beneficial to rush so I said fine Ive been at the Worldwound for six years I nearly had a headband amount of money saved up anyway Im getting paid much more now how much of a loan on my future salary are we talking about and it was six days so I bought one

Keltham almost asks how much she is getting paid but the financial amounts are conspicuous in their absence from her sentence and there might be some reason for that hell ask later in private Or hell just ask I should probably go talk to somebody about like project resources rushes or not rushes whether Governance has any priorities and all that Though before then I dont need Share Language until tonight and could arguably wait until morning depending on timing but can you wizardboop my clothing at some point before I talk to any Serious People

Yes And she does that 

So long as thats happening anyways can Keltham feel the magic at all while its going on next to him

No 

Keltham hopes he is not cursed to just remain a cleric Keltham also wants to be a wizard

Well Keltham can spend some additional time trying to learn that but Keltham should talk to project management before he sets his days schedule and before then he should eat lunch having failed at breakfast What does the menu look like today in Cheliax

Stuffed pheasant rolls various kinds of fish in various kinds of sauces fruit tart things

Fat protein carbs cool Simple low tech fare but the novelty of it hasnt worn off

Keltham fills up a plate and stops by Carissas spot to inquire about Golarions pre existing people who just had sex etiquette if any w rt his eating lunch with Carissa the day after vs eating lunch at the more populous table

It is that you should do what makes you happy

I suspected you were going to say that and I already predecided what I would do regardless of the object level etiquette answer if that was your meta answer so I would be able to tell you that your etiquette answer definitely wouldnt influence me but I still want to know what the etiquette is if there is one

Eating lunch with the girl you just slept with implies you are inclined to get attached one at a time not monogamy but like one developing relationship gotten to a certain point before you pick up a new one and eating lunch with all the other girls implies not that and there isnt etiquette about which one to imply and in this case there isnt even really the risk youll mislead people since everyone knows you are an alien and nothing you do will have the normal implications

Whether I can get attached to more than one girl at a time is an interesting question I guess Ill find out the answer to But I expect I can be attracted to more than one girl at a time

Keltham goes to sit down by the other girls Hes not quite sure what to say to Carissa feels pressure to have clever and intelligent things to say to Carissa and its easier to be part of a larger conversation with people hes seen less immediately

That this is a stereotypical dath ilan Boy Thing To Do doesnt change that Keltham is in fact a boy and doesnt want to expend the mental overhead on defying his gendertrope doomfate right now

Hes so bad at being Evil This is going to be such an uphill battle

Hi Keltham Meritxell says brightly Are there lessons today

Good question Probably What specifically the lessons are is something Ill know better after I talk project priorities with project management which I really need to go actually do Oh by the way point of curiosity how much are you currently being paid and then whatever the quantity is can you translate it into hours of unskilled labor

Well shit 

If anyone has an established answer to that they need to tell Meritxell immediately My contracts just for the week Im going to have to renegotiate it afterwards she says No one has told her Aaaaargh Its for 300gold which is I think around four unskilled labor years And if she gets in trouble for that it can just be less on an ongoing basis It being a lot less than that would be weird if Keltham knows anything about what wizards go for generally

Your economy makes no sense None It does not make any sense at all All of the sense was surgically extracted from it by advanced medical technology

Or are you just getting like come down here for a very strange and possibly dangerous week and then well renegotiate Exception Handling Money

Shoot is it too low or too high She has no idea what Kelthams calibrated off The latter When they grabbed us I dont think anyone knew exactly what we were being hired to do besides uh hang around an alien our age who Asmodeus had said to be helpful to

What does a regular wizard of whichever circle you are get paid

Like a tenth of that if theyre spending most of their time on things that make money

04 years week week is 1 50 year or so So twenty times more than unskilled labor Okay thats not too bad thats a relatively well paid person in dath ilan but not mad superboss money

Very little labor remaining in dath ilan is labor that requires no prior skill practice or native talent But the fact that there are a few things like that which need to be bid into any market and that everybody has that particular resource to offer makes it a reasonable sounding sort of thing to use for a unit of account assuming that you are otherwise the sort of people who just refuse to accept downward price stickiness and will instead repeatedly scream at everyone to adjust their damn prices more often instead of going for an inflationary unit of account that means a different thing each year and would require adjusting all the graphs Some Very Serious People think this was the wrong decision but its got a lot of civilizational inertia behind it

Good because it is true Meritxell really sees the merits of saying true things to Keltham Wizards dont start making what I think youd call mad superboss money until fifth circle

And thats 1 32 of wizards who are 1 of the population so that checks out you are not having most of the wage income going to a small fraction of all the people

One in thirty two wizards will eventually make fifth circle but fewer than that are fifth circle at any given moment since it takes decades says Meritxell Its like one in sixty One in a hundred I think its changing now in Cheliax since we have way more people training to be wizards than we did a generation ago but I dont remember the exact numbers offhand

Somebody whos already eaten a bit want to try like introducing themselves and their life story says Keltham Since I actually need to eat having missed breakfast while distracted Uh feel free not to if thats not a thing here

Keltham does start eating though

The girls glance at each other 

Ill go says Meritxell cheerfully I was born here in Ostenso my fathers a wizard and my mother is a cleric of Asmodeus She picked him out because she wanted smart children I have eight half siblings My elementary school was in the temple so I didnt actually leave it until I was ten It was a big temple though endless courtyards and secret passages and so on and it had an orphanage so I had lots of peers though I was smarter than them I had more toys than them so I traded them toys for doing all my chores When I was nine I tested into wizard school and was absurdly excited mostly because it was all the way down the big street When I was twelve my mother decided all this was embarrassingly uncosmopolitan and so she took me on a trip around the country by boat and that is how I discovered I get very seasick and declared I wasnt leaving Ostenso again until Im a high level wizard and can Teleport A declaration that was about to be falsified since Ive enlisted but now here I am instead of going to the Worldwound so maybe itll come true who knows

Huh That sounds a lot more normal for a geniuss childhood than I think I wouldve expected for Golarion Unusually smart mom who can afford childcare for lots of kids picks out smart dads spends part of her life having eight kids they all live in a huge group house with lots of secret passageways one of those kids is even smarter and ends up getting hired by a weird important project That could basically be the early biography of any dath ilani whos as smart for that world as you are for this one Except for the part where you literally didnt leave the enormous temple which I guess makes more sense if travel is more expensive and dangerous and the children get centralized to a particular part of the city where they dont get attacked by mind altering cornfields How many horrible Golarion things are you leaving out from that story because you dont want to embark on very long explanations of them Not asking for a list just a rough quantity

 none on purpose for that reason probably several because they didnt occur to me as horrible such as yes the fact its dangerous for children to wander around outside alone or I had more would be siblings who died Probably four or five things like that if I think about it

Kelthams brain does automatically generate the question How many dead siblings but it doesnt make it to mouth

I had an odd childhood for a dath ilani Keltham says A lot less optimized than most childhoods are My parents werent driven to make my life as perfect as possible just substantially better than not existing I agree with them about that to be clear but still a lot of dath ilani would be well actually were politely horrified about it Like lots of moving between different parts of Default uh thats the biggest city in Civilization where you live if you want to live around lots of options and you dont have any particular reason to live anywhere else Other parents wouldve been worried about frequent moves disrupting my childhood relationships On their philosophy maybe that wasnt literally optimal for me but Id probably be basically fine so they went ahead and moved any time they got bored Single family house module with only a couple of secret passages one of which was in the house library and just went around a corner from one bookcase to another bookcase in the same library I am currently making an error and my error is that I am not eating

Keltham resumes eating

That doesnt sound very odd for Golarion but usually itd be because the family had a job that required moving not because they got frequently bored

How do people move around here when their job requires it This villa seems like itd be very hard to pick up intact and move somewhere else by nonmagical means and most people cant afford teleports so thats not it Do you just swap houses and all your stuff with another family of similar size that happens to live in the right place Doesnt seem like that should happen at the same time often enough unless you have a monthly Moving Day and Golarion seems too uncoordinated for shutting up now eating

Everyone looks incredibly confused at him

 if youre a priest theres housing in the temples for priests assigned there and children theyre raising says Meritxell And if youre anyone else you look at apartments in the new place and sign a contract with a landlord for an apartment that has features you want and then move your possessions there In a wagon if you have a lot of possessions

That really sounds like something that would sound superficially plausible but then turn out to not work quantitatively once you started running numbers on how many empty houses you needed all over to always have the right subtype of house available for people to randomly move into

So even at the cleric or wizard level houses must not have expensive non modularly removable features that only a few people want because you cant take it with you if you leave the house Just features that everybody wants or stuff only you want that you can take with you when you leave

Or features that are common enough therell be a vacancy that has it says Meritxell It doesnt have to be universal But if you want something absurdly specific youll have to rebuild it if you leave

Wait how do houses get to places in the first place if you cant move them once theyre built Like this house looks to be way out in the middle of nowhere if you cant move it how did it get here after somebody built it

 they built it here

So like theres a place that makes sections of walls and floors that are small enough to be easy to move and they ship the sections of walls here and a local crew assembles those into a house using tools that are also small and easy to ship around 

 you cut stone and lumber and ship them down the river and then have mules drag them to the site and then at the site you build the stone and lumber into walls using uh stonemasonry tools and saws and so on

Mules drag them to the site Do you not have wheels Keltham quickly tries to recall whether hes seen anything with a wheel built into it He hasnt

Yes we do Mules drag wagons to the site if its not too steep or rocky for that

Is it like not particularly more cost effective the way your economy usually runs to have one place that makes lots and lots of something instead of making a single copy of something wherever it gets used

Definitely not for houses the transport costs would kill you It makes more sense to have one shipyard than a dozen small shipyards

Okay good When I heard that you were assembling single copies of houses from raw materials in individual places without even trying to build pieces of houses in a single place and assemble those pieces I was wondering if your whole world just didnt have centralized manufacturing for some reason

Ione has never done anything in her life like what shes about to do not since she was old enough to remember and if her soul belonged to Asmodeus she probably still wouldnt have done it

Keltham youre supposed to be eating she says

Right More food

 actually even if its relatively safer now Ione is not entirely sure why she did that

No one else gives her an odd glance about it because theyre too well trained Laborers time isnt very valuable so for most things its more worthwhile to send the laborers to wherever you want them laboring than to figure out how to send a bunch of pieces of something across the country Meritxell says For shipbuilding it makes sense to do it all in one place because you always want your ships in the one place and you have a harbor right there to send all the materials your laborers will need and also its quite specialized

Keltham nods his not eating error having gotten so bad that even other people have started to notice he does not reply per se

Most people build their own houses Tonia offers Or their neighbors come over and they all raise a new barn together from trees they felled from the forest right there and shingles they baked in the kiln right there

Swallow Dont hire specialized housebuilder because Nom

The village has a hundred people in it and theres a specialized priest and blacksmith and tanner but thats it Someone in the village needs a new barn raised or house built maybe once every couple years and thats not often enough to be the only thing someone does And you dont get visitors often enough to tell them oh you should send a team of housebuilders from the city Im going to want a house in the spring and if they did come you couldnt afford them And people are idle when its not planting or harvesting season so they may as well improve their land

Keltham bumps up the priority of cheaper travel on his list for causing people to like 

 trade with each other instead of doing things theyre not specialized in

How do nonwizards get between a smalltown and the nearest mediumcity to the smalltown

By boat if its on a river or riding a horse if its not and they have a riding horse or walking if its not on a river and they dont have a horse and poor people dont have riding horses says Tonia

Horse sounds like an animal and those arent cheap yeah

So basic alternatives to walking without combustion engines Bicycles take relatively smooth surfaces to bike on Are there roads between towns

 no

Theres a road from Westcrown to Egorian and its new and cost the Crown I have no idea how much money but only the Crown couldve done it says Meritxell Most places you travel by river or you mostly dont travel

So the key step on the tech tree is probably cheaper roads then to enable more professional specialization and trade between towns 

Keltham wishes hed read more novels about people going to other dimensions and rebuilding Civilization from scratch hes read like two and neither author recursed into roadbuilding

Swallow Saturated on road tech research or not really trying it Nom

I dont know of any road tech research projects though probably the people who built the one from Westcrown to Egorian wouldve gotten very rich if they figured out some better way to do it

You spent practically your whole life in a temple and then a wizard academy Ione says slightly scathingly You wouldnt know if there was a road tech research project any more than I would How would any of us know

Meritxell watch yourself were not supposed to know too much

Meritxell DOES know everything though She smiles at Ione Fair enough

Something about that interaction that just happened would never have happened in dath ilan and Keltham is having difficulty putting a finger on what it is exactly

Ione Sala has a slight nervous feeling like she just muffed something Needs to cover distract Well I might as well go next she says I was born in a middling city at the junction of two minor rivers My parents were a couple of low level city bureaucrats Intelligent enough not to be farmers but not really a lot smarter than that Incompetent failed filled with searing resentment at the world for it I was noticeably a lot smarter than they were so they hated me and did what they could to make my life more miserable without that affecting how much they could sell me for didnt know what to do with me really and wizard tracked me sold me like the farm animal I was as soon as it became clear that I was going to be a bookish wizard type My life is just that city then Ostenso academy I also wouldve expected to see the larger world for the first time when I went to the Worldwound not that Im complaining

I grew up on a farm where the nearest village was a couple hours of walking away and the nearest city much farther than that far enough no one had been Tonia says When I was seven the village got a priest and the priest said everyone had to come into the temple for school so I went and I hadnt seen reading or writing before but I picked them up right away and after a couple of months I was studying with the older kids and after a year he said I should go into the city where I could get a proper education and the church would house me and feed me while I did so the next time he reported back to a big city he took me with him and I came here and did a bunch of tests and then got put in wizard classes

Keltham is getting this weird feeling like he may at some future point predictably first order update towards wishing hed started industrializing Golarion slightly sooner even if it was just by a day or an hour

Keltham isnt a perfect Bayesian but hes a passable one By dath ilani standards

He finishes his last two bites of food quickly and says So can somebody direct me to like office of project management

None of the girls are sure where that is

When I talked to them they were working out of the temple but that was really temporary

Carissa mustve talked to them this morning she said she asked about headbands says Meritxell

Rise Move to Carissa location Should probably go talk to project management now Where to

One of the parlors I can walk you there How was lunch

Tasty enough and filled with slightly disturbing accounts of houses Houses which if this is considered a rich persons fancy incredibly impressive house I should probably try to avoid imagining in any concrete detail

Well he should be avoiding imagining it but in fact he is not Keltham is imagining people otherwise specialized in farming pulling down entire trees and then gluing them together its probably some form of chemical glue not fasteners metal is expensive here until the result looks like it has walls and mostly keeps out the wind

Oh good what a safe topic that doesnt require any lying about Maybe someday soon theyll have nicer houses Left down this hallway and down these stairs

As near as I can currently guess this is going to require figuring out how to build cheaper roads onto which one can put unpowered small machines that will let housebuilders quickly get back and forth from medium cities to small towns in order to build nicer houses without their specialized labor being very expensive because of travel costs which I thought to myself maybe I should go talk to somebody about all that

Sounds great She finds him the sitting room 

Keltham says a middle aged woman with her hair in a bun who is looking through the report on who Kelthams god might be

So my parents told me Yourself

Marta How can I help you

Id like to talk project resources and Chelish Governances priorities Before then do you mind if I ask whats the local larger organizational structure that embeds this project and your place in it

Yes My job is to track project spending track project revenue once it has any solicit project revenue estimates approve briefing on the project for new people it becomes necessary to involve and authorize acquisitions I report to Maillol who is a fifth circle cleric of Asmodeus and the site director Maillol reports to his superiors in the church and ultimately to the High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonn and to Her Imperial Majestys staff including Contessa Lrilatha who youve met

Among my top questions is to discuss what Governance wants in what order where any and all particulars may be rapidly revised in the face of particular avenues proving more or less tractable Is Governances value function over outcomes there sufficiently understandable to you that youre confident of your own ability to predict it with only rare referrals upward or should I be moving upward in the management tree to have that conversation

Governance is reasonably liable to change its mind a bunch in the next few weeks but probably the easiest way to give the Crown and Church more flexibility is to have as low importance a person as possible give an explanation now which itll then be possible for her superiors to override later if they change their minds That depends a little on your questions but Governances priorities have been communicated to me and I can do my best to convey them

Ill try asking my questions but if you dont correctly predict Management Aboves answer to them the result would be incorrectly prioritized outcomes that are potentially expensive for Governance relative to Governances optimally obtainable outcomes if theres anyone who can predict answers better Im sorry Im probably saying things that dont make sense for Golarion somehow

Though even if they dont have the dath ilani idiom of lower deciders registering their predictions of upper deciders predictions until you finally get to whoever in Management or whoever in the judicial courts or wherever is supposedly the gold standard for that issue Dont have junior people decide macro project priorities refer them to the top manager specialized on that project or in those priorities is a notion that Keltham wouldve thought projected down to the simpler case

Keltham is also noticing that if you try to do sensible Project Management while speaking in Taldane this is even harder than speaking other sensible thoughts in Taldane Should he ask Marta if she can Comprehend Languages No lets try pushing through for now

Before I go on around how much of what Ive already discussed with project members has been recounted to you by project members Or by Security or other observers

We have detailed notes on your presentation yesterday to your researchers Some of your researchers also individually came to Projects with questions or predictions based on class conversation and also mealtime conversations all of them are expected to do that at least by the end of the week when well renegotiate their salaries but not all of them have done it yet so you shouldnt assume we know everything you said in public to any of them

So as to be clear on how much of yesterdays presentation got successfully preserved do you mean youve got imperfect but cross referenced notes from students afterwards or was there an invisible wizard writing everything down verbatim as fast as I said it

A transcription spell rather than an invisible wizard was employed but we believe the notes to be complete You may look at them and issue corrections if youd like 

Id like to review my improvised extemporaneous lectures in case I made errors or omissions that stand out as needing correction yeah Thanks to whichever person for their hopefully routine competence in having set that up

Governance then should now have a specific rather than abstract or secondhand notion of what I know and what that knowledge can do Its built on a base level of trained skills of thinking that work together effectively because of overlapping coherence and direction inspired by explicit mathematical structure which were applied by my Civilization of a billion wealthier people of much higher average Intelligence to systematically decode and exploit reality to a far greater distance than Golarion appears to have traversed leaving also incomplete traces in my personal memory of specific facts techniques and methodologies that I encountered in systematic or unsystematic passing

I know why snowflakes have sixfold symmetry I can turn mechanical motion into cold without a Snowball spell but I dont know yet how much motion for how much cold I knew how to build a faster kind of unpowered sailing ship but it sounded like you have those already I know how to make an unpowered mechanical device that will let people move between cities faster than a person can run but only if there are roads between those cities I know how Id go about figuring out how to make cheaper roads but I dont know how long that research will take or how good the end results would be The books in the library here are written in ways that reflect patterns of thinking that I know are invalid and I remember some things about how to train a person as intelligent as I am so that theyll think effectively I know the foundational math that structured the kinds of thinking that I learned There is an attractor an overlap a center in everything whose structure is that math and by far the most important question is whether Golarion can be started down the path leading into that attractor and learn for itself what Civilization learned but there remains the question of what Governance wants to see first for scaling up investment in this

Many of those things are of interest to us but what we currently predict will be most immediately valuable is the habits of thought for intelligent people that make them competent to discover all the rest For any given solution there are often going to be a lot of Golarion specific reasons why its not easy to implement and our current prediction is that little not none of dath Ilans direct technologies will easily translate But if we understand the basics of how the gods reason and how human level intelligences can use the reasoning patterns of the gods then we can overcome any given complication that is due to dragons or Charybdis or the fae or whatever

Keltham doesnt know enough to be impressed by the sensibility of a crown boosted Abrogail Thrune because Keltham has no reference point for the usual sensibility levels of pseudo medieval governments

I suspect you underestimate how much would translate if we had the books in front of us but we dont and that means non Keltham people need to know how to fill in the gaps regardless

Such techniques are meant to be used however They are best taught as they are applied not as pure abstractions In Civilization children are not spoiled for a number of elementary physical truths and inventions so that they can learn underlying mental forms in the course of inventing them This regime is optimized for the final quality of the resulting adults however not for speed in rapidly retraining adults to the same techniques The point is we will at some point need a starting application

I havent hurried my attempts to ask for a starting project because it would be exhausting to produce an exhaustive list of everything I might possibly be able to do and so far it has seemed like it makes more sense to keep asking questions about local conditions until I orient so I can understand myself which of your largest problems I can probably solve quickly It will still help if I have 

Uh 

Your language doesnt have a word for the thing I want which is not an encouraging sign Does Cheliax have a central list of how much monetary value Governance puts on everything it usually pursues Like amount of gold its worth to cure an otherwise fatal disease in a one year old infant or the amount its worth to produce one more second circle wizard

No We could try to produce a partial one for you

Do you have a different solution for why your government is like capable of coherently wanting or planning anything given that its made up of more than one person For not having one person decide that its not worth 10000 gold to produce three wizards and somebody else deciding that its worth 15000 gold to produce one of them

The operation of wizarding schools is delegated to different people who can make whatever tradeoffs strike them as correct and then the ones who get good results for the resources the Crown has offered them get promoted Budgets for wizarding schools are set off what recent successful people spent

Is that actually as horrifyingly ad hoc as it sounds for an entire ass government

I would find a partial list useful of things Governance has previously spent money on how much money for what results in a way that struck upper Governance as being just barely good ideas but good ideas nonetheless Where the just barely qualifier tells me that the outcome was worth around that much money and not at least that much money

I would also suggest that Governance at some point take the time to reflect on its own operations and figure out how much it relatively wants different things Keltham reflects on the techniques he got taught as a kid for carefully extracting that info checking if it made sense checking if anything got left out where standard techniques for doing that correctly and not screwing it up are again something I can try to teach Its really not just about better forging techniques Civilization also knew how to for example manage very large projects effectively assuming all the managers are slightly smarter than I am so yes it may require adaptation but still

But Ive got no idea how much something like that is worth to you or what kind of increased project resources I could get after accomplishing that versus inventing a more visibly successful forge process that uses 30 less fuel and neither apparently does Governance itself have any collective idea what its worth to Governance I realize I may sound like Im flailing here but right now Im very much trying to orient at all to what Management wants from me and how much its willing to pay to get it

Id be happy to get you a list of projects that were just barely worth it and amounts wed be willing to pay for different kinds of progress Our current anticipation is that this will be things most Chelish people cannot learn so we will benefit more from techniques that some people who have learned them can figure out how to adapt for other people who cannot

Yeah the Intelligence problem is probably the severest problem you have if not the most quickly solvable one I dont suppose youd have any idea what effective price Governance puts on raising one random citizens Intelligence from 10 to 11 or 14 to 15

Well as an upper bound headbands of 2 Intelligence cost 4000 gold so were not willing to pay 2000 gold for it in the average case

Whos the least useful person who automatically gets assigned an intelligence headband as a matter of routine

Wizards promoted into command of a unit of more than 100 soldiers typically at fourth circle if they havent purchased their own years before that which they typically do

Thats very helpful thank you At what earliest point do we start looking visibly as useful collectively as a wizard in command of 100 soldiers

You are already estimated to be more useful than that and more resources than that are already ongoingly expended on this project our plan is to deliver you headbands even if we do not upgrade our estimate of the usefulness of the project but it will take a few weeks because of added security measures

Ah okay that makes more sense compared to what I expected an intelligence headband cost and what I expected this villa cost Security measures

Magic items can be cursed Usually this is not a major concern in the headband trade because a trained wizard with specific experience in detecting enchantment and mental manipulation will notice if were giving them to a bunch of young students with no such training we had better be very sure

Keltham almost asks why checking is harder than just giving them to a trained wizard to put on but stops himself even he can think of unlimitedly many ways to get around that test Are you worried about old cursed items accidentally getting into the system or specific adversaries targeting this project and with access to our supply network

Specific adversaries targeting Cheliaxs magic item supply chain though itd be surprising if theyd managed already to target the project specifically less surprising given how much divine intervention this project has already attracted I suppose Other countries have in the past tried slipping cursed magic items into our military supply chain for purposes of espionage or sabotage What were doing over the next two weeks is having the headbands made from scratch by trusted people and observed during the manufacture process and while theyre brought here so they cant be swapped out for others and then well do some tests on site as well then you can have them

He should ask Carissa about her own reasoning before asking project management about the safety of Carissas bypassing the system Keltham thinks it is not clear that everyones organizational internal incentives are perfectly aligned But he should ask Carissa about it soon

 actually wouldnt another obvious reason to take a few weeks to carefully manufacture headbands be if they wanted to custom curse his headband Or everyones for that matter Hm Also a thing to inquire about but subtly His next question was one that did occur to him immediately but was at first suppressed as lower priority so his asking it for this other reason shouldnt be much likelihood ratio to them

Maybe its the wrong use of your time to ask but if it can be said briefly what are the consequences if an adversary manages to infiltrate one headband

Likely ones they are able to eavesdrop That is the obvious multi purpose kind of infiltration adversaries frequently attempt Also likely theyre able to use it to track the wearers location or to tell what spells the wearer has gotten Less likely more concerning ones theyre able to interfere with the fundamental function of the headband enhancing intelligence by making some thoughts more salient or easier to apply full intelligence to and others less so Theyre able to detect at some low granularity the wants priorities and fears of the wearer

Aw crap Though plus side they would be less likely to tell him that if they were planning to curse his headband on purpose but still

Its plausible that if Carissa can detect cursed headbands well enough not to fear them Keltham can also detect them via sheer having any mental skills that even use Owls Wisdom but specific training always counts for an awful lot And of course Keltham only has their word that an adequate counter training even exists

Well hell figure that later Back to primary topic What would you say if I asked you to tell me about Cheliaxs most important problems independently of whether you thought I could solve them

The Worldwound is the most urgent problem We are allocating something like fifteen percent of our resources to containing it and it is not getting worse but it is not getting better either After that periodic epidemics of cholera smallpox polio plague and flu ongoing deaths from tuberculosis malaria and diarrheal diseases droughts inadequate nutrition the threat of war risks from random powerful wizards doing very stupid things

Directly challenging Worldwound fighting sounds like it would take weapons weapons take trust

Keltham is not very calibrated on how well they do at fighting epidemics here but if thats their second worst problem 

About how much would the government pay to avoid one epidemic from whichever is the worst class of epidemic and how often does that happen

And suppose that I ask somebody to come by tomorrow whos an expert on epidemics and current countermeasures so I can quiz them I dont particularly expect this result but suppose it turns out I can tell you something on the spot that combined with your other magical capabilities completely wipes smallpox or flu What could I expect in return and how would the project scale from there

I expect we would pay fifty thousand gold pieces to avoid one epidemic noting that delaying one in one city through very good precautions usually just means it hits there later because no one developed immunity through infection I expect we would pay something like a million gold pieces that completely made a major cause of epidemics go away if that didnt just mean all the same people die but of other things through some mechanism I dont know what higher budget project items youd want more of Contessa Lrilathas time More students More miscellaneous magic items but we could arrange any of them if you achieved that

Keltham nods thats grim but true If plagues reduce population density to make future plagues less likely or if people starve until their immune systems weaken and after a plague the survivors get more food per capita those are both equilibria that will get restored around the variation of particular causes Ill think more toward generalizable measures that will shift long term equilibria of epidemic levels rather than on specifics of one epidemic then if your impression is that naively eliminating one particular source of epidemic would say cause urban density or food per person to increase or decrease until the remaining epidemics became more virulent

Ill obviously also want a contract before solving particular things and itd be nice if there was some generalizing way to assess that value rather than my constantly interrupting myself to negotiate and sign new contracts Thats part of why it would have been useful to have a schedule of how much value the government assigns to things we could then negotiate general percentages covering what I and other project members would capture of the value we create

We will try to come up with such a schedule for you and a proposed general contract along the same lines as the one you negotiated for general intellectual concepts with Contessa Lrilatha If you would like I can lay out approximately the terms wed expect that to have though I dont have authorization to make commitments on that scale on the Crowns behalf 

Understood Go ahead then

Cheliax expects to request most of the gains maybe 80 or 90 of Kelthams inventions while he is repaying them for the loan of this villa and a full time research staff and a full time security staff the loan will accumulate interest at the same rates any devil in Hell gets if they get a loan in Hell usually humans have to pay higher interest rates than that but thats because frankly lots of humans will run away and not pay and they both trust and can verify Kelthams assurances on that front Cheliax expects to request much less of the gains perhaps half once the loans are repaid A complication they are keeping in mind is that uh Cheliax doesnt have a systematic way of collecting benefits that dont literally directly accrue to the state in the form of higher tax revenues from various dukes and it sounds like Kelthams society would have such a method 

Kelthams reportedly distracted again in equity negotiations Thats great because Carissa has decided the entire harem needs to read a bunch of Taldane romance novels so that if they cant stop themselves from thinking in romance novels theyll at least be whatever kind the King in Taldor has commissioned to develop appropriate attributes in Taldane young women 

 it turns out romance novels in Taldor are not commissioned by an Imperial office at all which is itself the kind of useful thing you only learn by pretending to be Taldor

The women depicted here Ione says after flipping through and rapidly skimming some of the books would sit around waiting for Keltham to pursue them because they are so attractive they cant help rich nobles falling for them even if they pretend they dont want it I think what weve learned today is that when you dont have an Imperial office commissioning romance novels theyre written to appeal to the most self indulgent aspects of the reader because nobodys making the authors do anything else

The women depicted here Paxti says are passive weak stupid lifeless ambitionless trophies Somebody remind me why we havent already conquered Taldor in real life

Ive known Keltham for a day and a half and I can already guess these women are not his type says Peranza

Your parents grew up reading stories like these in our timeline Carissa says tiredly You grew up after Hell took Cheliax to straighten us out and you got to read normal modern romance novels in which girls win the boy Though none of the ones in which the girl wins the boy by cleverly getting all her romantic rivals eyes gouged out or in which the girl wins the boy by leaving him under the impression shes an important noble considering executing him unless he wins her over and not The Damnation of Sir Nicholau actually I dont know what romance tropes the slightly gentler Cheliax were going for has maybe theres a version of The Damnation of Sir Nicholau where shes trying to teach him to enjoy himself instead of having perfunctory sex he doesnt really like and he goes to Hell once he realizes that he wants things for himself instead of only wanting whatevers best for other people and in every disguise shes happy and fine because she unlike him has been raised competent to understand what she wants and to go get it

Wouldnt work as a story Ione responds immediately If shes happy and fine then theres not enough conflict from the standpoint of the viewpoint character She needs to be struggling with her own need for violent sex say at the same time as shes trying to get him to want things for himself Her character needs to develop to where shes competent to understand what she wants and the end of the novel should show her successfully going after it and getting it

Which again was basically the plotline of Perverting Adan 

Its the plotline of any young adult novel with a female protagonist who will at some point have to learn the darkness of her own desires Ione snaps at Paxti As youd know if you read more than one book a year 

We can work with this though Paxti says Give me and Ione twenty minutes and well come up with new plots for everyones favorite romance books with storylines that fit the new Cheliax

Ill slit her throat before we get two minutes in says Ione Ione also sees a much bigger problem with that idea but shes curious whether Sevar will spot it on her own

Carissa is thinking that possibly she should ever have read a romance novel Sounds like keeping track of a lot of lies Id rather have one or two good ones that are very appropriate for what were trying to accomplish

Ione nods Its going to be interesting to see whether or rather how fast Sevar gets executed for heresy once she gets into the habit of noticing all the constant lies

Actually if I can get an authorized lie on this none of us much like reading fiction at all Ione says Cheliax has been devoting too many resources to the Worldwound and the books written before Hell took over are trash If we talk about any fiction weve read in front of Keltham hes going to ask to see it Remixing fiction isnt like redoing a spellbook with Glimpse of Truth renamed to Glimpse of Beyond Maybe we can rush some better books from Absalom and read one apiece before Keltham gets around to asking about that so that we can have ever read a novel But if he asks before then you tried reading novels from old Cheliax and quickly gave up

 yeah all right In that case lets give this up as a useful reminder of how grateful we are to live in Cheliax and get back to the histories

Theyre not going to have all that much time for it Keltham may not be very trained to handle potential lies and gaslighting but he was planning to be a Mad Investor and hails from a vastly more financially sophisticated Civilization Hes not going to negotiate and compromise with Marta and then sit down in front of an actual authorized negotiator who takes their final compromise as Kelthams starting point and negotiates a new set of moves in Cheliaxs favor

This wouldnt usually happen in dath ilan firstly because dath ilan would just seat both real negotiators directly and second because the principles behind bargaining positions are better understood such that theyd try to have bargaining outcomes be invariant to the order in which considerations are introduced But dath ilan does have the concept of hiding an unusually high willingness to pay so that sellers cant price discriminate against you and sending in a negotiator who doesnt actually have the power to make commitments is a standard known failure mode to avoid

Keltham will of course say all this to Marta directly none of that meta information has any obvious rationale for keeping it secret

After that hell ask Marta more detailed questions about terms and conditions on Cheliaxs starting offer and more questions about the current size of Cheliaxs economy and what kind of measurement difficulties they expect to run into and Governances likely willingness to pay for various goods But he wont negotiate except insofar as offering his own starting remark that the offered percentages of generated value seem acceptable if theres no gotchas in how profits or expenses are measured and sufficient for quick agreement from there but he wants to understand the terms and conditions before he says for sure that the starting offer is generous

At some point Keltham thinks he needs to give Cheliax a lecture on fairly dividing gains from trade anyways If he can run through it quickly he might as well do it today and see if that saves some time on negotiating If they know that dath ilani approach fairness in a very structured way maybe he can just tap himself with his own Truthspell and the Fair Division of Gains from Trade spell say what the fair price would be and have them accept that

Keltham wraps up with Marta having hardly exhausted his unending sequence of Additional Questions of course but thats just what life is like for your first few weeks in another dimension and heads over to the library

If Keltham is teaching again Broom should be there to make sure Keltham does not teach anything which is obviously going to destroy the world

Visibly or invisibly Broom is still within Kelthams one day deadline for replying to Kelthams original terms Do the great wizards know if Keltham will be able to detect Broom again today Does Cheliax want Broom to be visible regardless Broom goes to ask a great wizard about this

They have Kelthams spells and he doesnt have Invisibility Purge but it seems likely thats in anticipation of Cheliax not trying to sneak any invisibility past him They dont bother explaining that to Broom obviously but they tell him to be visible If he needs to stab someone he can go invisible for that to make him harder to stop

Broom catches up to Keltham before he reaches the library He doesnt say anything as he falls into step behind Keltham the less he says the less chances there are for him to fail

Why is Kelthams life like this He hopes the research harem is okay with brief explanations because he sure doesnt know what exactly is classified

Keltham walks into the library with a very short armed person walking behind him Hi Keltham says This is Broom

SHIT did he learn about slavery and now hes upset about it

Hello Broom says Carissa sounding bored 

Broom will be listening in on my lectures from now on Further questions should be directed to Broom because I dont even know what anyone is supposed to think about this

Well he doesnt sound as mad as hell be when he finds out about slavery

No one says anything

He would have questions in their shoes Have you like not noticed that you are confused about this

Im confused says Meritxell But you just said not to ask you questions and uh Broom hasnt said hell take questions And I assume Projects also isnt taking questions about this or theyd have told us about it

Right Sorry Not your fault Its just 

Never mind For a start today Im going to try to quickly review the way that dath ilani learn about negotiation 

Or actually no before that theres a test I realized yesterday I should run Before things go much further Keltham is a little worried about where exactly he is inside reality right now Its probably just a silly worry But yesterday with Carissa he thought of an obvious possible way to check on it quickly if everyone here is honest It might not work but then it might

Keltham grabs a couple of the improvised markers from yesterday and goes to the section of wall that was being used as an improvised whiteboard with erasure via Prestidigitation

Keltham first shows how to use Unanchored Scales an experimental elicitation tool for when you just want somebodys intuitive strength of feeling about something without them worrying exactly about what any numbers mean Draw a line with two endpoints representing not at all and all the way and then you draw a slash through the line at the point that corresponds to your intuitive strength of feeling You could use it to ask How warm is this room without people bugging you about how warm a 3 was supposed to represent Its not perfect obviously but the point is that the elicitation method acknowledges that imperfection up front

Keltham then asks everybody in the classroom including Carissa to answer two questions separately anonymously on bits of paper to fold up and mix before he looks at them Obviously they shouldnt consult with each other at all before answering Obviously Keltham promises to make no effort to figure out who wrote down what He really does want them to write down an honest answer though if they write down anything at all they can draw an X cross on the paper if they want to openly refuse to answer

The two questions Keltham writes on the whiteboard are

How much do you have an unusual interestingly complicated backstory or current problem that Id find out about if I got into a relationship with you

What do you expect will be the average answer of everyone here to the previous question

Well shit Does he expect theyre dishonestly coordinating backstories 

 she raises her hand 

Carissa

Unusual for in my case a third circle wizard at the Worldwound and in their case a top student at Ostensos Academy of Wizardry or unusual for a random person in Golarion

Now thats a philosophically interesting question What Keltham really wants to ask is if their personal stories would seem surprisingly interesting to whoever is playing the hypothetical original LARP that this realitynovel is deconstructing But theyre not going to have a better answer to that than he does

Well Keltham would be the paying player of the original LARP so I think what were looking for is the expected degree to which I a dath ilani would say something like Wait what after I found out So the fact that you spent years at the Worldwound would be like a third of the way across because its surprising to me and matters to me while you being secretly a dragon shapechanged into a human if you knew Id find that out later in the relationship would be more like two thirds across Maybe lets say its only past the halfway point if youd expect other people here to be surprised

 nod Okay she isnt sure what hypothesis he is entertaining here 

She will mark herself as less than halfway surprising if Keltham somehow learns chosen by Asmodeus to rework theology to be dath ilani then the whole game is up anyway and the average as less than her because shes pretty sure the others ought to be indicating less surprisingness than that 

Tonia is pretty sure shes not at all surprising in any way unless they count the having sold her soul which Kelthams not supposed to learn about She indicates that she is not surprising and that other people are only slightly more surprising than her 

Meritxell would like to be a shapedchanged dragon Or have a fascinating tragic backstory or something Those feel like the way to be the best at this and shed like to be the best at this Shes pretty sure if shed had like a months warning she could have had the best sexual fetishes too but thats hard to do from a cold start She reluctantly marks down that shes not very interesting which is incredibly painful to do and that the average person is probably slightly more interesting than that which is agonizing

This is probably her fault isnt it unless Carissa screwed up even worse Ione puts down a two thirds mark since shes secretly a very rare chosen oracle of Nethys and not just a hidden worshipper

She gives the general class a one half mark hoping that others are wise enough to realize that what theyre telling Keltham there is the expected degree of weirdness thats normal for Golarion which influences how much hell think is normal

Paxti puts down 1 2 and 1 3 She doesnt have a fascinating though ordinary for Golarion backstory yet but she wants to reserve space for getting one

Asmodia puts down 0 and nearly 0 She doesnt actually want a story

Pilar silently writes her answers

Gregorias father is the heir to the Barony of Blanes She doesnt think this makes her very interesting firstly everyone knows the man in question has a thing for that and hundreds of children secondly probably most other Barons are like that thirdly its not as if shes ever met the man For all she knows her mother could be lying If it were a Duke then thatd probably count as a little bit interesting but a Baron Not really 

Hopefully theyll get a good distribution of claims of interestingness so that any given girl can pretend later to have assigned a different one than she in fact did but they cant coordinate and its hard to guess what other people will say 

Gregoria frowns at her pen for a bit and then picks at random on the unremarkable half of both lines

Well Thats a very interesting response pattern

It doesnt quite fit the LARP begins with 3 5 primary love interests some of whom start out knowing about some of the others plus a bunch of relatively normal girls who think everyone else there is also normal Half the respondents thought everyone had backgrounds almost totally uninteresting to a dath ilani which may indicate a failure of perspective taking or a failure to process the instructions somehow

What he shouldve done was run a pilot of this procedure asking about the degree to which everybody liked lunch or something

Very helpful there obviously correct thought but youre arriving a little too late

Right then Keltham says Can I get somebody to destroy these papers before the universe notices them

Broom now has additional questions

Broom needs to see the papers before they are destroyed

Broom I was joking

Broom will have questions for Keltham later Broom still needs to see the papers now

They didnt consent to that in advance and it does not seem appropriate to ask for their consent afterwards

See this is why you have to TELL KELTHAM ABOUT OTOLMENS because otherwise he will NOT treat Broom like an institution you shut up and cooperate with But Carissa has made that recommendation in the strongest terms she can and its over her head and she shouldnt countermand it now and also has no justification to herself know anything about Otolmens 

You also didnt tell us you were going to destroy them Meritxell says I have been assuming maybe all of our notes are going to be preserved for posterity or something

Keltham reminds himself that he was previously angry at Broom for reasons that shouldnt influence his behavior this much and tamps down his irritation

Fine New poll use this symbol for destroying all notes and then Broom can ask you to re generate them for his observation if he wants This symbol for Broom being allowed to look at them first before they get destroyed This symbol if you think its great to preserve those notes for posterity Minimum vote not average vote

He does have any reason as Im given to understand it But Broom you will need to ask in advance on future occasions this kind of after the fact modification is destructive of trust in implied experimental contracts

Keltham writes down the new poll and symbols on the whiteboard underneath the previous questions The three symbols are V and X since it should be hard to tell what somebody is writing by looking at the motions of their quill drawing two slanted lines that optionally touch or intersect accomplishes this

This is such a terrifying exercise and itd be really nice to know what Brooms deal is

Idea Carissa thinks grouchily Kidnap or hire whatever probably hire because if theyre scared itll mess with the data a bunch of Taldane wizard teenagers to put through all these experiments for us to learn from how theyre responding

She puts a V for letting Broom look because Aspexia Rugatonn seemed to think they should cooperate with Otolmens and Aspexia Rugatonn is the expert

Ione doesnt know what this guys deal is but if hes here then Security wants him here and shes not going to piss off Security without a reason She puts down V

Asmodia puts down X Paxti puts down X Pilar writes down her own answer

Meritxell puts down X Gregoria puts down V

Keltham checks the votes then hands the notes over to Broom The vote was to destroy after you read them

Broom thanks you he says Slaves learn somewhat more politeness than is usual in Cheliax for non slaves

Broom reads the poll results

It does not look like a situation that is not heading into an enormous mess

Broom will decide what to do about that later

Okay now can somebody please destroy the answers in a clear obvious way where everyone can see they were destroyed

Broom if you could set them down on the floor clear of anything we can just light them on fire

Broom swiftly sets them down

Presumably no one has lit Otolmenss oracle on fire but possibly no one has told him not to worry about it 

She lights the papers Presumably Security now using a scry rather than an invisible person has been watching over Kelthams shoulder and theyll have a lengthy deanonymizing debrief later

Right then Leaving all that aside until their plot induced lack of mutual communication blows up catastrophically on the whole group later I thought today Id try to speedrun a couple of years worth of dath ilani lessons for children about how fairness in negotiation works On the theory that first of all Cheliax could stand to get a glimpse of how dath ilanis childrens training works in general and second that maybe if an adult with average dath ilani intelligence hears about childrens training in the abstract they can just imagine that they went through that training themselves

The reason Im picking fairness as the topic is because Im going to be using those structures to negotiate equity and those procedures do tend to hope that everyone has mutual knowledge common knowledge stuff that everyone knows that everyone knows about how fairness works Before I start if I can ask the group what does the term that fairness translates into in Taldane mean to people here

 a concept for stupid people who think they deserve more than they can claim and hold Meritxell doesnt say 

Getting what was agreed upon

Trades where neither side is getting cheated

Rules that are applied consistently or impartially

Everyone gets what they earned

How can you tell how much somebody has earned If you make a one of a kind magical item what price should it sell for so that neither side is being cheated

Whatever you can get someone to buy it for says Meritxell

My shirt is a one of a kind relic from another plane it has no standard market price In real life I plan to never sell it ever though I might sell the ability to do science to it Suppose however that relative to how wealthy I expect to someday be my shirt one of my only memories of dath ilan is worth one million gold pieces to me In the sense that if some insidious force was otherwise going to steal my shirt from me I wouldnt pay any more than a million to protect it

Now suppose somebody else has a very weird magical spell that can take any relic of dath ilan and immediately convert it into ten million gold pieces no questions asked

Any price greater than a million gold and less than ten million gold is a mutually beneficial trade in the sense that both of us are better off making the trade at that price than not trading with each other at all But if my shirt sells for only a million and a thousand gold Im only a thousand gold better off and the other person is around nine million gold better off If my shirt sells for ten million minus a thousand the other guy has profited by a thousand and Ive profited by a bit less than nine million

Trading at all at any price in the range is mutually beneficial were both better off But on top of that event theres another event a question of the exact price in which my being one gold piece better off makes the other person one gold piece worse off

How do we set that price then Arent we locked into an adversarial game where its my interest to say Ill only sell at ten million minus one and its their interest to say Ill only buy at one million plus one Why would we say anything else when saying anything else just makes the other person better off at our own expense But if we both think like that the trade doesnt occur at all

What price is fair Or to put it another way how can two people like that agree on a trade at all How does Golarion how does Cheliax think about that

It hasnt come up in their books about Taldor yet but Carissas met Taldane adventurers and in fact tried to trade them things and the answer is the same there as in Cheliax You barter You say why I dont see why I should give up this shirt for a coin less than twenty million gold which communicates Im open to negotiating a trade but would need to be persuaded its the best trade I can get and the other person says twenty million I have a hard time believing even such a sentimental item is worth more to you than an entire week of Nefreti Clepatis time during which she could make a dozen duplicates of the shirt and make you a personal demiplane besides and that would only be eight million gold And really it seems to me like this trade is worth your time even for one duplicate of the shirt and the personal demiplane and that would be only eight hundred thousand gold which is what Im offering Which communicates Im open to negotiating a trade but would need to be persuaded its the best trade I can get

And you say my imagine what Nefreti Clepati would say if you tried to lowball her prices like that Im not sure this conversation is worth my time if my shirt is worth so little to you Which communicates and you might be bluffing youre allowed to bluff when youre doing this that the quoted price is well outside the range thats worth it to you and theyd better indicate that they think theres overlap between their willingness to pay and your willingness to sell

And you iterate on this and then end up settling somewhere the exact place depending on how competent at bartering you are and on the range of trades you both like

 fascinating

Consider as a dath ilani might consider it the problem of a dath ilani cast into a strange new universe who must trade with the aliens found there

It is in fact quite a common trope in dath ilani science fiction But it wouldnt particularly occur to Keltham to classify this situation as that trope Cheliax is way too legible They have a currency of gold pieces that they cheerfully translated for him into unskilled labor years Golarion would need to be a lot weirder before it was good Trade With Aliens science fiction

The aliens one may suppose have a biological evolutionary setup similar enough to dath ilans that they have epidemics caused by viruses and bacteria and parasites Suppose the aliens dont know about viruses and bacteria and parasites or vaccines or antibiotics or filtering masks or possibly even sterilization Nor about how one should use experiments to determine whether a disease is airborne or waterborne or touch transmitted or transmitted through wastewater contamination or is carried by smaller or larger animals

The dath ilani then knows something which this alien Civilization might find of great value The alien Civilization can perhaps pay for this knowledge with some alien means of payment

Perhaps the alien Civilization being nonhuman or just non dath ilani tries to be stingy about it to lowball the dath ilani to buy their knowledge at a cost of say a pile of shiny metal or title to one island in the ocean Depending on the exact backstory of how the aliens came to try this and whether it was in some sense the fault of that whole civilization or just a part of it even a non Keltham dath ilani might well say Screw you pay me

That too the dath ilani are taught in Golarion terms the difference between Lawful Good and Lawful Stupid

But then how high does the price need to be exactly for the dath ilani to agree to the trade By what system do you determine an answer to that

The notion of a fair agreement a fair trade a fair division of gains from trade a fair price plays a central role in any civilization that relies on its citizens conscious understanding of their activities Dath ilan teaches the Law mathematical structure underpinning fairness very carefully and from childhood After all if lots of people ended up with widely different notions of what was fair Civilization would stop trading with itself

In turn the notion of fair trade relies on understanding the notion of trade in the first place

Jellychips a staple of dath ilani lessons to young children are small lumps of edible flavored gel Jellychips come in distinct appearances colors shapes and flavors almost always everything with exactly the same appearance has exactly the same flavor Ten jellychips might mass as much as one peanut theyre meant to implement a burst of tasty flavor thats just enough to be present and pleasant Theyre tiny so that children dont get end up getting all of their calories from economics lessons

To teach the notion of trade you begin by passing out jellychips to children and let them experiment a bit to find out which of their favorite flavors have which external appearance Then ask the children to write down which flavors they like more or less than others Compare the lists observe to the children that they tend to like different flavors more or best There is in fact a jellychip selection algorithm based on previously observed food preferences among the kids which makes sure that this happens Observe to them that by trading jellychips with each other they could all end up with more of the kind of jellychips they want

Let them trade a bit as they desire So long as they havent been introduced to any formal concepts of fairness to complain about this part usually does not go too poorly among dath ilani children Theyll find jellychips that they have and dont want and look for somebody else who wants those and has some they want and trade 1 for 1 If you let them play longer theyll start to notice triangular trades that no two children can complete and do those too but still usually 1 for 1

When the first rush of trading has died down introduce to the children the concept of a multi agent optimal arrangement an arrangement such that its not possible to redistribute the jellychips in any way that leaves all of the children better off simultaneously Ask them if they think their current arrangement got there

Now the kids have a concept of a social goal to aim for a way in which they can be collectively winning at trade or performing subpar and the arguments will become a bit more heated

Especially if youve sorted all the kids to have a certain sort of personality and usually therefore all be boys because sometimes different children learn different things and some of those things are best learned by similar children all together

It usually doesnt take long for one boy to start telling another that they need to make a trade in order to get the classroom into what theyve figured as the optimal arrangement

Of course the older kids immediately step in at this point and remind everyone that by the definition of multi agent optimality you should never need to force somebody to trade in order to get to a jellychip arrangement thats better for everyone the target state should be better for the person whos making the trade too

 Not actually a room in the sense of being indoors children need to be exposed to outdoor light levels in childhood in order to not grow up nearsighted The surface area required for children to spend enough of their day outdoors is currently the limiting factor on the urban density of the Great City called also Central City and Default This is one of the places where public will and private incentives are in conflict since theres a pressure towards ever greater urban density in the center but if this were permitted soon it would be mostly childless people who could afford to live in Civilizations dense center For that and other reasons its been decided that its better to limit the Great Citys density and keep Civilization more spread out To find a solid expanse of skyscrapers youd need to visit a major city with few or no children per capita like Big Quiet or Erotown

After this enlightenment an adult Watcher comes forth and argues to the younger children that the whole point of trading things is that different people put different values on the same goods if you 1 like black jellychips and have blue jellychips and you 2 have black jellychips and like blue jellychips then you can both do better by trading jellychips with each other

This the Watcher argues solemnly is the point of trade and the whole reason why people trade with each other because they get different enjoyments from owning the same things so that they can both become better off by passing the same fixed goods back and forth between themselves

The younger children are asked if they first order believe that

None will say yes at that point The most overeager ones will say No but then be unable to explain why not Most kids will give the brief Baseline comeback that colloquially translates to I probably would have believed it if I wasnt pretty sure you were trolling me though I havent seen anything that I suspect is the real argument against it

A dath ilani childhood tends to make one grow up suspicious of things that grownups say with great solemnity Civilization considers this a desirable outcome which is good because it sure is the outcome theyre getting

Regardless of their answers the children are then asked whether people who all got the same enjoyments from the same goods would never trade with each other And so that pathway of learning continues

On a separate track through the lattice of knowledge a new idea may now be introduced on those foundations the notion of a fair trade between black jellychips and blue jellychips 

It begins by showing the children a way to rearrange their understanding of jellychip preferences as a quantitative relation and not just an ordering through the concept of indifferences which state equalities of preference Not just I like purple jellychips more than black jellychips and black jellychips more than blue jellychips but I am indifferent between having 5 purple jellychips or 6 black jellychips or 8 blue jellychips

But then of course you might be able to execute multi agent beneficial trades that arent 1 to 1 If someone is indifferent between having 6 black jellychips and 8 blue jellychips then trading 7 blue jellychips for 6 black jellychips will leave them better off than before Right

A lot of children will say No at this point and try to find some reason why that couldnt possibly be valid because they know how economics lessons work by this point in their lives They expect that somebodys about to lead them down a pathway that takes them down to 6 black jellychips and then 5 purple jellychips and so on until they only have one jellychip left 

But you can with a bit more work convince them that its totally valid to want 6 black jellychips more than 7 blue jellychips and valid to trade things according to your wants and tell them that in fact this does not necessarily always expose them to a set of clever trades that take them down to 1 jellychip which it will then be proven to them they must want to trade for nothing Thats not actually going to happen Youre thinking its going to be the point of the economics lesson but its not Adults actually trade 7 hours of labor for 6 fancy shirts all the time without ending up with 0 shirts and this is isomorphic

The children are then asked if they think they can get to a more multi agent optimal state by trading uneven numbers of jellychips amongst themselves

The children approach this warily or with a burst of initial enthusiasm that fades after many children prove rather suspicious of attempts to get them to trade more jellychips for less jellychips

Dath ilan having an average Intelligence of 16 or 17 it doesnt take long for somebody to point out that even if one person likes some jellychips more than others thats no reason for them to end up with less jellychips Other kids also like some jellychips more than others Why shouldnt they be the one to end up with less jellychips and I be the one who ends up with more if thats how were going to play it

Why yes Keltham was the first one to say it in those terms in his own class when he was very young

Suppose that Keltham is indifferent between 3 black jellychips and 4 blue jellychips and that Limyar is indifferent between 2 blue jellychips and 3 black jellychips Suppose they both start with 12 black and 12 blue jellychips

Then for Keltham to trade his 12 blue jellychips for 10 black jellychips from Limyar would leave them both better off

And for Limyar to trade his 12 black jellychips for 9 blue jellychips from Keltham would leave them both better off

And for Keltham to trade his 12 blue jellychips for Limyars 12 black jellychips would leave them both better off

All three of these are mutually beneficial trades

But which of them is fair Or fairest

If youre the sort who agrees to just any trade thats mutually beneficial like Limyar in this classroom had been earlier arguing people ought to do then you know what Keltham is going to do to you

Thats right Keltham is going to offer 9 blue jellychips for your 12 black jellychips youre going to accept Keltham is going to carry out the trade and then Keltham is going to angrily throw another 3 blue jellychips at you and yell that youre being stupid

If you step out and look at that problem from a wider angle its pretty much the same issue that holds between the dath ilani and the alien civilization considering the price of medical knowledge

If the alien civilization offers some tiny lowball offer like say a supply of food and water in exchange for every last scrap of your knowledge and theres no other civilization around to trade with you and they will both be better off if you accept compared to if you dont

But if you accept offers like that one food and water is the most you can expect to be offered if the aliens are less Lawful Neutral than Keltham

Even if theres two alien factions around to trade with you cant quite rely on them bidding against each other What if they coordinate with each other instead Theres a noticeable amount for both of them to gain if they both agree to offer you only food and water instead of a higher price

Another game is now introduced to the children played with a single flavor of jellychip It is not in dath ilan called the Ultimatum Game but the actual name they have for it is the Final Trade Offer Game which isnt all that different

One child gets a dial with settings from 0 to 12 Another child gets a button The first child picks a setting on the dial and locks it in The second child then chooses whether to press the button If the second child presses the button the first child gets as many jellychips as the dial indicates the second child gets jellychips equal to 12 minus the number on the dial If the second child doesnt press the button they both get nothing

Which is to say the first child proposes a division of a gain of 12 jellychips where they get some part and the other child gets the rest The second child can approve the division or refuse it and if they refuse both get nothing

If you run this lesson on dath ilani children virtually everyone offers a 66 jellychip split and everyone accepts it

At least thats what they do on round zero the initial round where they try things the simple way to verify their starting assumptions Then they start experimenting Its not so much that theyre being selfish and trying to figure out what they can get away with its that theyre figuring there must be some clever point to this game and youre not going to find it if you just offer 66 every time

Some kids try out accepting splits of 75 Other kids are like ok then and offer them 75 splits which usually get rejected if like people are going to make a thing out of that right Some try offering compacts to trade 75 splits for 57 splits but theres no guarantee that any two kids will be matched up again in the future

At this point the older kids step in and say that the point of the game is drifting away from the reality its intended to model and everybody nods and waits for the next part Of course theres a next part Theres been a weird game and no stunning insight about it has been presented yet Theyve ever been to a lesson before Older people arent going to make you execute a weird pointless procedure and then not have some stunning insight to offer you as payment kids would stop going to lessons if that bargain was often violated

Before the next part though the older child teaching asks what the kids think is probably the ideal or correct thing youre supposed to do if somebody offers you a 75 split not as a game but in real life

Keltham of course said to reject the offer Some other kids agreed the offer should be rejected Some claimed that you should accept it but everyone should be angry at the person and whoever went next with them should offer them 75 Limyar claimed that you should always accept it even if the other person offers 111 because everyone would end up with fewer jellychips if you rejected than if you accepted so rejecting the offer couldnt be multi agent optimal Keltham asked Limyar if he actually believed that Limyar said no but he was going to go on saying it anyways to annoy Keltham

The kids argue about it for a while and then the demonstration moves on

The next stage involves a complicated dynamic puzzle with two stations that requires two players working simultaneously to solve After its been solved one player locks in a number on a 0 12 dial the other player may press a button and the puzzle station spits out jellychips thus divided

The gotcha is the 2 player puzzle game isnt always of equal difficulty for both players Sometimes one of them needs to work a lot harder than the other

Now things start to heat up Theres an obvious notion that if one player worked harder than the other they should get more jellychips But how much more Can you quantify how hard the players are working and split the jellychips in proportion to that The game obviously seems to be pointing in the direction of quantifying how hard the players are working relative to each other but theres no obvious way to do that

Somebody proposes that each player say on a scale of 0 to 12 how hard they felt like they worked and then the jellychips should be divided in whatever ratio is nearest to that ratio

The solution relies on people being honest This is perhaps less of a looming unsolvable problem for dath ilani children than for adults in Golarion

Once this solution is produced and tried once the older children congratulate the kids on having solved the first layer On to the second layer

In the second layer some children get handed sealed cards before each game telling them whether to be honest about it or to try to grab a little more for themselves Though remember say the older children that this is all only a game we are trying to ask how Civilization can be robust to bad people not teach you to be bad people yourselves the thing is you see that on scales much larger than this class there really will be some bad people

And that means the child who sets the dial or the child who presses the button cant trust the other to be honest Even if the other childs sealed card didnt say to be dishonest the first child has no way of knowing that

Dishonest people really do complicate things dont they Just the fact that they exist makes things harder on everyone else because they dont know who the dishonest people are But thats part of the difficulty of constructing an adult Civilization one that has to scale to numbers beyond two dozen or sixteen gross

The children start having to think harder at this point There are kids playing hard on puzzle games and hearing estimates of the other players labor effort that dont sound quite right proposing splits afterwards and seeing those splits rejected and both getting nothing Some of the kids start to get angry at each other Others are trying to come up with a brilliant general solution and if theyre wise they know they havent found one Some children are not so wise but they cant get anyone else to go along with their brilliant general solution

Keltham plays through with as much cold and steely determination as a seven year old can muster offering exactly what he thinks is fair rejecting anything he thinks is less than fair feeling awful when the other kid yells at him that he was being honest but not swerving from his course He can trust himself he cannot trust the other When his card tells him to be dishonest Keltham gives ridiculously huge estimates for his own labor and hopes the other child is wise enough to know that Keltham is must be lying Sometimes hes told to be dishonest and he has to pick the split himself and then he gives a huge estimate and pretends he believed the other kids huge estimate Sometimes the other kid doesnt catch on in time and then Keltham has to offer an unfair split or tap out of the game and metagame entirely which feels like failing even more Sometimes the unfair split gets rejected and sometimes it gets accepted which is worse Keltham sets aside all his unearned chips to redistribute after the lesson ends Its a good thing this is only a game because living life like this would be awful

Lessons end for the day It is sometimes good to let children dwell for a time on problems that dont have known solutions yet or realize how awful life can become when not everyone has deduced the governing Law

Children actually do better dath ilan has found if you try having them play this elaborate game without having previously introduced the concept of a multi agent optimal boundary or the notion of the Ultimatum Game or the question of fair trades between unequal numbers of jellychips Then they just play and negotiate without a concept that they are Failing To Reach Multi Agent Optimality or the notion that children who disagree with them are Refusing To Make Mutually Beneficial Trades or that the offered trade was Unfair The children are less distracted by ideas they dont know how to operate goals they dont know how succeed at and ways to argue that people who disagree with them are doing some particular thing objectively incorrectly There is a valley of competence as a function of knowledge in this case where knowing just a little can hurt you

When the children return the next day the older children tell them the correct solution to the original Ultimatum Game

It goes like this

When somebody offers you a 75 split instead of the 66 split that would be fair you should accept their offer with slightly less than 6 7 probability Their expected value from offering you 75 in this case is 7 slightly less than 6 7 or slightly less than 6 This ensures they cant do any better by offering you an unfair split but neither do you try to destroy all their expected value in retaliation It could be an honest mistake especially if the real situation is any more complicated than the original Ultimatum Game

If they offer you 84 accept with probability slightly more less than 6 8 so they do even worse in their own expectation by offering you 84 than 75

Its not about retaliating harder the harder they hit you with an unfair price that point gets hammered in pretty hard to the kids a Watcher steps in to repeat it This setup isnt about retaliation its about what both sides have to do to turn the problem of dividing the gains into a matter of fairness to create the incentive setup whereby both sides dont expect to do any better by distorting their own estimate of what is fair

They play the 2 station video games again Theres less anger and shouting this time Sometimes somebody rolls a continuous die and then rejects somebodys offer but whoever gets rejected knows that theyre not being punished Everybody is just following the Algorithm Your notion of fairness didnt match their notion of fairness and they did what the Algorithm says to do in that case but they know you didnt mean anything by it because they know you know theyre following the Algorithm so they know you know you dont have any incentive to distort your own estimate of whats fair so they know you werent trying to get away with anything and you know they know that and you know theyre not trying to punish you You can already foresee the part where youre going to be asked to play this game for longer until fewer offers get rejected as people learn to converge on a shared idea of what is fair

Sometimes you offer the other kid an extra jellychip when youre not sure yourself to make sure they dont reject you Sometimes they accept your offer and then toss a jellychip back to you because they think you offered more than was fair Its not how the game would be played between dath ilan and true aliens but its often how the game is played in real life In dath ilan that is

After that came the part where Kelthams learning group was introduced to their first sophisticated trading game with tokens that produced varying quantities of jellychips but only when held in proximity to other tokens and large enough groups of tokens could produce more tokens

Despite their best efforts and the lesson theyd just learned and since they were still young boys after a lot of shouting beyond a certain point the nascent market had soon shut down almost entirely over refused trades caused by disagreements about what was fair

During the games post mortem it was eventually figured out with some nudging and hinting from the supervising older children that children with rarer tokens had tended to think that the weight of a tokens value for its even division ought to be determined by that tokens scarcity children with tokens that produced lots of jellychips even if they required some other tokens to be nearby to work tended to think that direct jellychip production was the obvious starting anchor for weighing economic value children with tokens that produced other tokens argued themselves to have the only goods that mattered in the long run and that youd need a lot of lesser tokens to trade fairly for one of those

This begins the pathway of learning that leads to market prices the other way of setting prices in which larger Civilization has a collective interest in seller prices ending up close to the marginal cost of production so that as many trades as possible occur

Children who master the complications here have officially passed Financial Literacy Layer 2 and can have their own investment accounts which was the main reason Keltham was going through this whole lesson sequence at age seven instead of age eight

 Having an investment account in dath ilan is the equivalent of having a bank account in other places rather than a mark of greater financial maturity than that Dath ilan doesnt particularly use as a store of value currency denominated packaged bank debt with fixed returns Value is stored mostly in equities When you write a check against your investment account divisible fractions of equity are automatically sold out of it in some medium of exchange and automatically reinvested in the receivers account according to the simple autoselling and autobuying algorithms on both sides If you want to pay for less volatility in your assets you buy insurance on the equity so that somebody agrees to buy the asset from you if it drops below 80 of its original purchase price and the price of insurance like that is a risk signal

When it comes to selling knowledge to aliens to be clear Financial Literacy Layer 2 is not going to get you there If the answer across every plausible premise was trivial and similar that trope wouldnt be such a staple of dath ilani economic fiction

Thankfully Golarion is not nearly weird enough for Cheliax to be composed of aliens in the relevant sense the Chelish have money and will tell you how many unskilled labor hours it corresponds to The most you have to worry about is that somebody gave them a dishonesty card which does mean you have to do your own calculations about whats fair and not just ask them

When you are not dealing with alien aliens when setting prices with those aliens is not the point of the story a normal dath ilani would consider the solution obvious There comes a saturation point beyond which individuals cannot realistically use any more money to become happier themselves for usual reasons of just noticeable differences being a mostly constant fraction of how much you already have which implies utility roughly logarithmic in wealth If the aliens offer to pay you that much asking them to cough up more would mean that a number of poorer aliens would all have to give up chunks of utility that loom larger for them so that you could get much smaller amounts of utility and even if thats fair it isnt Good If the aliens offer an ultimatum for less turn them down with very high probability theyre trying to give you far less than youre worth Would Civilization offer less than a billion labor hours to an alien bearing knowledge of how to eliminate whole swathes of diseases hitting large sections of the population No

Of course in a normal dath ilani economic fiction isekai story the entire world you end up in is not insane in every part there may be one insane point of departure with some insane consequences lawfully extrapolated but the author is not going to throw an entire insane world at you it wouldnt be credible

A normal dath ilani thrown into another world does not come in expecting to need enough money to make lots and lots of important investments that the natives havent made because the natives are insane Theyre expecting to find an alien efficiency of no simple ways to make everyone collectively much wealthier not the howling absence of that efficiency

Keltham wasnt expecting Golarion either

He did however catch on in short order to what he currently thinks is the magnitude of the problem

It is possible he will need a lot of money to solve it

If youve actually got to negotiate with very humanlike aliens you need Financial Literacy Layer 5 or at least Keltham hopes thats what he needs because thats what he has This gives him access to a spotlighted permutation based method for determining the fair contribution of one actor to a multiagent process Its not spotlighted nearly as hard as say the Probability axioms or Validity but its pretty much the only spotlighted method for that kind of fairness and Civilization is somewhat hopeful that aliens will use it too

The permutation based method says to consider how much marginal added value an agent produces by being added to a collection of other agents when considering every possible order in which to add all agents into the evaluation If for example two people are both needed to complete a task worth 10 jellychips and it cant be completed at all without both of them then theres two possible permutations

Permutation 1
Alis Alis alone receives 0 jellychips her marginal value added to the empty set is 0
AlisBohob After adding Bohob the payoff is 10 jellychips Bohobs marginal product added to Alis is 10

Permutation 2
Bohob 0 jellychips
BohobAlis 10 jellychips

Averaging the marginal products together across all permutations the method says that Alis and Bohob both receive 5 jellychips

Yes this is a very simple answer to be produced by all that logic but the point is that it generalizes

Applied directly to the situation with Cheliax the method says roughly that Keltham should receive an amount proportional to how much marginal product he adds on average to all possible ordered subsets of Cheliax If Cheliax had only half its current people for example Keltham might only add around half as much value For even smaller subsets of Cheliax product might fall superlinearly Keltham couldnt necessarily accomplish 1 20000000th as much with a single Chelaxian

It adds up to somewhat less than half of his marginal product when added to all of Cheliax probably Yes this is a very simple answer to be produced by all that logic but the point is that Keltham knows why that is the fair answer and what he ought to do if he gets offered less

Keltham doesnt spell out this part explicitly or say that he was willing to accept Cheliaxs opening offer taken at face value and indeed would have compromised on substantially less had it been necessary Cheliax mentioned difficulties in accurately measuring the gains to the country and may intend to offer a measuring methodology expected to be an underestimate of the real value or it could be that Cheliax is thinking the split is about direct profits from project sales where Chelish consumers are capturing much more value than the sale price of the products the consumer surplus

Also Keltham might find theres weird terms or conditions in there in which case he wants to get the highest initial offer on hand so he can burn percentage points as bargaining power to iron out the terms and conditions He can always hand back any excessively generous jellychips that are still left at the end of that

Somewhere in a place that is not this place so far away that there is no distance and no time between here and there a former airplane passenger named Thellim reads how Earth economists have tried to analyze the Ultimatum Game played by splitting 10

Earths economists have concluded that it is irrational to refuse a 91 split since it leaves you 1 worse off They note that human subjects seem to be irrational by occasionally refusing offers below 5 with increasingly great probability as the offer drops Perhaps it is meta rational to develop a reputation for acting irrationally since it causes people to make you bigger offers if they know youll irrationally refuse smaller ones For some reason they dont continue on to ask why not develop an irrational reputation for refusing all offers below 9 instead of 5

Thellim swiftly infers that Earths moon prevents its inhabitants from thinking clearly about negotiation

Shes mistaken Its kind of a long story

Sometime even later Thellim is going to conclude that maybe its not the moon She will then wonder if theres any way to explain to Earth economists how the absolute basics of negotiation work in coherent decision systems eg those consistent under reflection in the presence of correlated agents and or models of agents Or even minimally get them interested in what sort of irrational behavior rational agents want to have reputations for having and if theres any systematic structure in there that might possibly be interesting

It turns out that Earth economists are locked into powerful incentive structures of status and shame which prevent them from discussing the economic work of anybody who doesnt get their paper into a journal The journals are locked into very powerful incentive structures that prevent them from accepting papers unless theyre written in a very weird Earth way that Thellim cant manage to imitate and also Thellim hasnt gotten tenure at a prestigious university which means theyll probably reject the paper anyways Thellim asks if she can just rent temporary tenure and buy somebody elses work to write the paper and gets approximately the same reaction as if she asked for roasted children recipes

The system expects knowledge to be contributed to it only by people who have undergone painful trials to prove themselves worthy If you havent proven yourself worthy in that way the system doesnt want your knowledge even for free because if the system acknowledged your contribution it cannot manage not to give you status even if you offer to sign a form relinquishing it and it would be bad and unfair for anyone to get that status without undergoing the pains and trials that others had to pay to get it

She went and talked about logical decision theory online before shed realized the full depth of this problem and now nobody else can benefit from writing it up because it would be her idea and she would get the status for it and shes not allowed to have that status Furthermore nobody else would put in the huge effort to push forward the idea if shell capture their pay in status It does have to be a huge effort the system is set up to provide resistance to ideas and disincentivize people who quietly agreed with those ideas from advocating them until that resistance is overcome This ensures that pushing any major idea takes a huge effort that the idea owner has to put in themselves so that nobody will be rewarded with status unless they have dedicated several years to pushing an idea through a required initial ordeal before anyone with existing status is allowed to help thereby proving themselves admirable enough and dedicated enough to have as much status as would come from contributing a major idea

To suggest that the system should work in any different way is an obvious plot to steal status that is only deserved by virtuous people who work hard play by the proper rules and dont try to cheat by doing anything with less effort than its supposed to take

Thellim could maybe solve this problem if she put around five years of her life into taking the knowledge and putting it into a form where the system thinks its allowed to ever look at it or talk about it without that being shameful But Earth has problems that are plausibly more important than their entire field of economics being firmly convinced that a particular set of crazy behaviors are rational and that healthy prosocial equilibrium solvable behaviors are irrational

She ends up writing a handful of blog posts about it tossing mentions of it into a couple of stories she writes on the side and otherwise leaving Earth to its fate there Earth has rather a lot of awful fates going on simultaneously and that one is not literally their most important problem

This however is not her story

Keltham in any case now attempts to recount to Cheliax what he went through as a kid to learn about the basic concepts of negotiation

The first part of this would be handing out assorting jellychips to children as selected to guarantee that different children will have different preferences over them but all will find those tastes and textures pleasant at all letting the children trade among themselves which they usually do 1 to 1 and peacefully introducing the concept of a multi agent optimal solution to the kids which gives them a social goal they could be failing at instead of just a few voluntary improvements to make among themselves whereupon they start yelling at each other to make particular trades for the good of the class and then the older kids come in and remind them that by the definition of multi agent optimality solutions like that should make all the kids better off so you shouldnt have to force anyone to go along with trades leading there

How are the Chelaxians doing so far

Absolutely no yelling at each other to make particular trades for the good of the class Say what you will about Evil it doesnt inculcate that particular tendency 

Meritxell has made herself a multi column tracking sheet six of them actually ordered by different things 

Can everyone report to me their hypothetical reward preferences in uh negative wrist slaps Imagine well settle it out at the end by giving out a number of actual wrist slaps equal to the reward so theres no incentive to overstate or understate your reward preferences

Keltham wasnt expecting them to go off and immediately start setting up games to simulate the thing he was describing despite the absence of actual jellychips hed sort of wanted to see if imagination would be enough but hes not going to stop them if they do that

He draws the line at the wrist slaps though The point of positive rewards in this case is that theres an incentive to play the game at all Keltham says If you tried paying dath ilani kids in negative wrist slaps they could avoid all the wrist slaps by not coming to class Its like trying to buy shoes at a shoe shop by threatening to wreck the guys shoe shop unless they give you shoes Even if they did give shoes the guy doesnt want to be part of the whole system then and now they have an incentive to call the town guard okay town guard sure And anybody else who sees thats how you operate has an incentive to poison your shoes and send you to the afterlife early before you come around to their shop When youre trading things the other person actually wants they want the whole system to stay in place which is what makes stable equilibria possible Its an important difference

 I want the whole education system to stay in place says Meritxell baffled It taught me to be a wizard

Wait do dath ilani children just not go to school if they dont feel like it Wouldnt that get you a lot of people who never learn anything or at least never learn anything they arent being bribed to learn

And never learn how to do things that are unpleasant for a long term reward 

Civilization goes to a great deal of effort to arrange things so that kids actually do want to go to school because dath ilani kids are smart by your standards and the grownups do not actually want to get into a contest with us about whether or not we can rig the schools boiler system to explode if we use a cunning plot with coordinated distractions It doesnt matter that they would very likely win they dont want to get into the contest with us Ah with them I mean they do still have all sorts of security systems to make it hard to blow up schools because you know kids but theyre based on the assumption of fending off like three kids who want to see if they can not three hundred kids who all have the same incentives

Chelish kids do not coordinatedly try to destroy our schools Meritxell says faintly after a while Even wizarding kids who are smart It wouldnt even be hard with magic you wouldnt need coordinated distractions but no one would do it even if youd made a very bad mistake at school and were going to be disciplined they did check Taldor beats students for misbehavior too You dont have to be so nice to children they wouldnt ever occasionally wish their school was on fire you just have to teach them enough discipline that even when they wish it was they dont do it

Maybe if youre Good and refuse to use any punishments ever Carissa feels like shes kind of caricaturing Good here like if she said this to a paladin theyd object that obviously they do punish people when appropriate then you have to bribe everyone all the time to just nondestructively participate in society because the differential between cooperation and noncooperation still has to be just as large and youre trying to do none of it with pain

Ione Sala is starting to feel nervous for the first time about what exactly Lord Nethys might be working towards with His plans around Keltham

Well its not as if she has any other options so moot point shell go along with His goal even if its exploding Cheliax or whatever Its not like she has any friends here

Look I get that Golarion is a poorer and more dangerous place and that you cannot afford to have kids occasionally successfully destroying their school You still want to treat children as miniature adults right so that theyll grow into adults with the right shape When they grow up into adults you dont want those adults sticking around places where theyre being hurt or tolerating the existence of systems that leave people worse off than if the whole system didnt exist So you dont put children into childhood situations where their own incentive is to destroy everything around them and all they lack is the power to do that

Chelish students are not incentivized to destroy their schools even if they wouldnt get in trouble for it because becoming a wizard is really valuable says Meritxell Their incentives are sometimes on the scale of their lives not on the scale of that specific day being more fun than not fun but thats how being an adult is too

Do kids here already understand that when theyre seven years old Five years old By the time somebody understands and has integrated subtle incentives for their future self spanning decades theyre no longer a child they dont need adults to guardrail their decisions anymore

I suspect theres some weird sticking point here that look sufficiently young kids do get slaps on the wrist Civilization doesnt like it I dont like it but even dath ilan never figured out how to produce healthy adults while never doing that at any point There are elements of morality and personhood that humans just werent designed to learn without experiencing small amounts of pain in childhood But every time you set up a situation where a kid gets told that they need to do something or else get slapped on the wrist you also add some value to an investment account the kid gets access to when theyre older such that even if the kid was secretly an adult in a kids body they would still be calculating a net benefit on being present for the whole transaction To make sure the total interaction is still mutually beneficial which means beneficial to them too so that ideal kids wouldnt have an ideal incentive to escape their parents or destroy the whole system Civilization goes on optimizing its heritage and the kids keep getting smarter and more Law comprehending which means that you always check all the interactions with children to make sure that the system wouldnt fall apart if the kids started being more ideal intelligences than expected one year And having to pay that amount to set up a potential wrist slap situation reminds adults to check every time whether they really needed a wrist slap there

I realize you cant afford any of that but it is how Civilization thinks We dont want to build into the system a load bearing assumption that our kids are stupid and weak even if they are

It has occurred to most of the girls that ideally they should be learning Kelthams economics not arguing with him about punishment so they nod gravely rather than trying to explain the dozen things wrong with that

The most obvious thinks Meritxell is that you dont actually want adults who believe themselves entitled to blow up any system that isnt serving them because then you end up like Taldor having a civil war every few years 

The most obvious thinks Tonia is that kids can in fact run away and get eaten by wild beasts if they want and none of them do so they obviously think being around their parents is better than not that which theyre right about 

The most obvious thinks Gregoria is that adults are still children in Kelthams ontology and the only real adults are gods

The most obvious thinks Carissa is that the fundamental system in which everyone is participating in is existence life and then afterlife and thats so obviously wildly worth it that no possible specifics could matter itd be like trying to sell someone a 6 Headband of all three mental statistics for the price of an afternoon scrubbing floors and assuring them that you wont yell at them for missed spots It doesnt matter its all nothing next to the magnitude of the gift theyve already been given the only reason theyre even able to parse it instead of rounding it off to the zero it is is because their minds are broken and theyre very small and stupid If a god were somehow born into a human childs body they wouldnt care if they got hit in class or not human weakness isnt any particular nature of the bribes but the fact theyre required at all and planning for more perfect agents would mean planning for agents whose thoughts were too big and vast to give this question a seconds contemplation

Keltham notices that hes running across a class of external and internal subjective sensations that precedes learning something is horribly wrong with Golarion and sets it aside because hes allowed to take longer than two days to learn about all of the problems At least the problems theyre making no effort to conceal from him which they dont seem to be doing here what with having just volunteered all of that info

Anyways they can play a pretend version of the trading game if they like so long as they dont try to literally pay in negative wrist slaps because no just no thats the literal opposite of the larger point

Keltham checks their final result and references it against the supposed ordinal preferences for the players Does it look multi agent optimal at a computerless glance

Meritxell has helpfully circled each trade and noted why it increases utility for each participant and then written down possible trades from the final state and why they dont If somethings wrong its a more complicated error than that the girls are in fact heatedly speculating now in whispers about whether there are local multi agent optimal maxima that arent a global multi agent optimal maximum

 right Not actual children here

If theres such a thing as a local optimum in that sense which isnt global you ought to be able to produce a simplified example of it Say try constructing one with three players and three kinds of jellychips Keltham suggests

Theres not going to be Meritxell says If there were and we knew what it was then we could just switch to that arrangement

It could be better for someone from their starting point but not better for them from the place we just arrived at and higher value total 

If its higher value total and they get a veto we use some of the higher value to pay them

Oh I see do we have continuous jellychips now Keltham must have forgot to mention that feature of theirs

Would you care to state exactly what is a local optimum and how it differs from a global optimum

Take like water says Gregoria Water flows downhill but if it flows into a crater or something its not going to go up in order to get to keep going down And water usually isnt sentient and even when it is its not very smart but you can have a situation where everyone agrees that the current situation isnt as good as some other situation but none of them have a step thats a clear step up for them And Meritxell is right that if you have centralized control you can just make everyone go to the new place even though theres not a series of smaller mutually beneficial steps to get there and also that if this involves some people losing out you can pay them but that doesnt always work like for example if youre dividing things that come in units

This comes up in spell structures

Comes up all over all of reality including in the basic elements of the human body that the tiny spiral instructions say how to make which fold up into configurations of least local resistance in order to have the kinds of material properties that they do Id guessed that spells were the same way almost as soon as I heard about them

Anyways I agree thats a good metaphor but if you could have a very simple arrangement of three players with three jellychips of three kinds what would you say about that situation which made it a local multi agent optimum and what would you say about it that made it a global multi agent optimum

Its a local optimum if there arent any trades anyone can make that leave both parties to the trade better off and its global if there are no possible states of the jellychips that leave all three people better off

And can you prove that a local not global optimum is impossible for three players each with one jellychip of three different flavors Proving something for a simple special case is often easier than proving it for the general case and sometimes is a good start on a general proof if the problem hasnt been selected by some sadist that is not what the dath ilani word troll means but okay fine Anyways proving it impossible for three players with three jellychips might be a start on proving it impossible in general and in fact there would be a lot of really interesting other proofs you could derive from that one

Asmodia doesnt feel particularly driven to succeed in class today but 

I have a chip Meritxell wants more than hers but I dont want her chip more than mine Meritxell has a chip Paxti wants Paxti has the chip I want We can do a three way trade but no two way ones Sadist she mentally completes

If theyre continuous you can make that work with partial jellychip trades 

Theyre not continuous

Continuous doesnt help says Asmodia Meritxell wants my one chip but without Paxti she doesnt have anything I want Moving fractional chips around doesnt help with that Not unless theres continuous players like every possible mix of Asmodia plus Meritxell plus Paxti

Some students scribble in their notes for a little while until they are satisfied with this

Asmodia who is of course still pretending to be cheerful and energetic will have enthusiastically written out the example

Asmodia Has banana prefers apple banana cherryMeritxell Has apple prefers cherry apple bananaPaxti Has cherry prefers banana cherry apple

Asmodia wants Paxtis cherry But Paxti doesnt want Asmodias banana

All right on to the notion of non 1 to 1 trades and quantitative indifferences New game but instead of just saying that you prefer some flavors to others you say things like Im indifferent between having 3 apple jellychips and 4 banana jellychips

This opens up the possibility of trading jellychips in a non 1 for 1 way Anybody want to try playing that game if theyre running quick simulations

This seems like it makes it much harder to get stuck but no one has an impossibility proof yet They do not seem to have noticed the fairness problem Or theyre writing down different possible trade outcomes but not with any sense that some of them are more desirable except subjectively

Keltham quietly hands Meritxell a folded up note telling her to try to end up with as many chips as possible for herself in the course of suggesting mutually beneficial trades to the others

 well all right then 

The other students do notice this You recorded five to seven as the canonical one but it could be four to eight too

Guess you should be the one writing it down Meritxell says Paxti seven blue for nine green

Give me ten

You have recorded that you like green only nine percent less than blue so Im offering you nine

You have it recorded that you like blue a third more than green so 

But Im not offering you ten Carissa six blue for four red

 is that allowed

Is what allowed

Are you allowed to not make trades that your utility function says youll take In this game

Well you did it first you turned down seven for nine Carissa six blue for four red or if you make it five red Ill throw in refusing to trade with whoever your least favorite student is

What if its you

Done and done give me five red I promise I wont trade with myself all day long Gregoria twelve red for thirteen green 

Am I allowed to change my preference weightings 

Obviously not

Keltham am I

Definitely no

Gregoria hands over thirteen imaginary green Meritxell turns around and hands eight of them to Tonia for blue She looks supremely in her element and shes talking several miles a minute withdrawing any trades the other girls dont agree to instantly

 you would think they would somehow teach kids about this sort of principle before they let them have investment accounts let alone allocate years of training to wizard school

Keltham will wait until they have ended up in a multi agent optimum one of the many possible multi agent optima which happens to have a lot of imaginary jellychips in the possession of Meritxell such that indeed it is not possible to make all the students including her better off by taking some of those away from her and looking for a more evenly distributed optimum

It takes a while because Meritxell refuses so many trades but they get there eventually 

Keltham shall now observe to them that if Meritxell has 12 green and prefers two blue to three green and Gregoria has 12 blue and prefers two green to three blue then all of the trades 5 green for 7 blue 6 green for 6 blue and 7 green for 5 blue are mutually beneficial but differently divide up the gains from trade

Theres a lot of different ways for jellychips to be arranged such that they cant be moved around without making at least one player worse off For example Meritxell could have all the chips and nobody else could have any Then any other way of arranging the chips will make Meritxell worse off So thats one of the many possible global optima

Different paths through the mutually beneficial trades will take you to different global optima So long as all the trades are mutually beneficial you wont end up worse off than if you never traded at the end but you might end up much worse off than if youd traded more carefully

Keltham is a bit surprised that they didnt more quickly see the way in which this game resembled real life since they seem pretty good at mathematical comprehension of the sort of structure that this game has in common with real life But that will come with having more than one days practice with parsing up games and real life into the pure abstract structures and simple mathematical properties they have in common with parsing up real life as a shadow of Law that is then recognized at once when incarnated in some much simpler game

All of what Kelthams saying makes sense to them 

Ione wonders in the back of her mind if theres some way to actually go between worlds that way by understanding real life as an instance of Law and then sort of going through that Law to end up in a different instance of real life 

You know what shes going to stop thinking that now Thinking things in the back of her mind has gotten her into enough trouble already

Well now that theyve seen the problem of dividing gains from trade in a simpler form re encountering it as a more mathematical structure have they got any new ideas about how to decide how many blue jellychips to accept for how many green jellychips

 it depends what the other person will accept

You want to be keeping the books Meritxell says Then everyone knows youll be doing the most favorable trades you can and if they dont want to trade with you theyre just out of luck Or have some other kind of asymmetric reason you can say Im holding out for better which they cant

They could in fact have mostly stopped trading with you and traded with each other instead until the game was almost ready to end And even then if youd tried to make trades too sharp they could have just said no and offered you more even ones and if you refused those trades well then the game ends without being multi player optimal

Even if you make your mutually beneficial trades very slanted in your own favor people cant end up worse off from trading with you compared to if they didnt trade with anyone at all

They can end up worse off by trading with you compared to if theyd traded with other people instead

So they walk away and find other trade partners if you try to capture too much of the gains from trade for yourself

This too is a lesson with a mathematical structure that appears in both this game and in real life

Sure but its costly to go around trying to find possible trade partners In practice if you own the books you get the bulk of the gains from trade

Then some book owners are going to really lose out once Keltham figures out cheaper roads and bicycles so Keltham thinks but also meta thinks fast enough not to say out loud He is not quite sure of his larger social situation and maybe he is better off quietly not pointing out certain winners and losers just yet

Dath ilan has some excess wealth beyond bare living needs and now that Keltham thinks about it probably a much more structured investment scene which a hundred thousand annoyed customers can easily use to pay the startup costs of a new company that makes whatever you make and contracts to sell it more cheaply for the first ten years to its founding customers So Im the only trade partner around does play less well there If he emphasizes the part with the vast wealth Golarion wont have for a while thatll maybe sound less threatening to anybody reading these reports compared to if they realize that roads will apply the same market pressure Does Cheliax have a lot of places where say theres only one seller of food 

 not food because outside of cities everyone grows their own food says Tonia and lots of them bring it to the city to market

Only one shoe seller though

And even cities might have only one fifth circle wizard who can cast Teleport for you or one fifth circle cleric who can Raise Dead

Well I can see how the fifth circle wizard could end up quite wealthy that way but surely a shoe seller must be much wealthier still After all while most people probably dont use Teleports everyone needs shoes and the shoe seller can charge whatever they want for them

 you dont have to have shoes says Tonia

I bet the fifth circle cleric wants shoes though so maybe the shoe seller can set shoe prices incredibly high and capture all the money the cleric got by Raising Dead

Well if he can Raise Dead he can also cast Mending on his own shoes or buy them secondhand off someone else or go disguised so the shoeseller thinks hes just a random laborer

Yes people often do have a lot of other trades they could make or other people they could trade with if somebody else tries to capture too much of the gains from trade You want to give them some incentive to stick around and keep playing the game

Sure The shoeseller mostly picks his prices but he doesnt have absolute power or something Absolute power a simple two syllable word in Taldane

Does he not He can just put up a sign saying the price is now a hundred million billion gold pieces Nobody can stop him

The costs of finding some other solution are high but theyre not that high He gets to capture almost all the gains from trade as long as the gains from trade are smaller than the cost of going to the next town over or something for a cobbler But in practice they are so he gets to capture almost all the gains from trade

All right if thats really true Im now a bit confused If I imagine how much value everybody in a town gets from having shoes compared to not having shoes at all it seems like it should be an amount more than ten times greater than the amount to set up a new cobblers business And how is the cobbler capturing most of the gains from trade when hes selling shoes to the cleric who might be deriving ten thousand gold pieces of value from being able to wear shoes at all

The cleric buys his shoes in the city when he gets called into the city on important cleric business says Tonia And how would you set up a new cobblers business you dont know how to make shoes and if you tried hed just lower his prices until you starved and then go back to raising them

Okay so you dont actually have the thing where everybody getting ripped off would pool some money start a new cobbler in business and refuse to buy from the other guy for a while even if he lowered his prices

Pool what money says Tonia 

The money that everybody in an entire city would have otherwise needed to buy overpriced shoes

Twenty households in a village The poor half havent got any savings The rich half have a couple of family heirlooms theyll sell if its a drought and a healing potion for if the womans dying in childbirth and the clerics out of town and they dont even use it if the babys dying no ones so rich to use healing potions on babies

Keltham closes his eyes for a second and reminds himself that afterlives are a thing and you can talk to the people in them right now Its not like the babies are being cryosuspended

A village that size shouldnt have its own shoemaker then unless shoes wear out really fast You buy shoes in town when you go there to sell whatever you make or the person who buys whatever you make in the village brings shoes over to sell when he travels to pick it up Or am I wildly off base on how that would have to work

 that is a town twenty households

Twenty families is a RELATIVELY LARGE GROUP HOUSE

Pretend I just said city instead of town then

Tonia shrugs I dont know how it works in cities

Shoesellers compete in cities Meritxell says 

But eighty ninety percent of Chelish people live outside the cities Carissa says Its true in Taldor and she looked up whether it was true in Cheliax too because it might be an important difference if it were different and Cheliax keeps but doesnt publish statistics on that and its also true in Cheliax

No I mean does a town of twenty households have one person whos a shoemaker

Yes says Tonia He doesnt only make shoes he works in the fields at planting and harvest time just like anyone who can walk and tans leather for the shoes but also for anything else you want leather tanned for but yes the town has a shoemaker because its too far from a city for people to go there for shoes People farther out come to the town for the shoes

And this person is much richer than everyone else in the town because he can charge whatever he wants for shoes Serious question I am actually trying to grasp how Golarion works here

No He can charge whatever shoes are worth to people but that isnt enough to make him rich because no one else has much to spare so shoes arent worth all that much to them Hes richer than people who have to buy shoes from him mostly And then he just gets spread out more ways because more of his kids live Unless he kills some but Tonia has learned they dont do that in Taldor

I have a sense that theres some breakdown of communications here and I hypothesize that maybe its a missing concept of consumer surplus as distinct from usual market prices being what defines gains from trade As we would put it the consumer value to you of shoes isnt the amount youd usually pay for shoes like that in a market its the amount youd pay not to be forever forbidden from wearing shoes ever again if there was some powerful anti shoe magic otherwise about to afflict you and you had to pay a fourth circle wizard to counterspell it before it took effect In dath ilan wed usually expect the consumer value of an item to be noticeably higher than the selling price The distance between consumer value and selling price is the consumer surplus the amount of the gains from trade that goes to the consumer

The market price of shoes should settle somewhere not too far from the costs of making leather and going to cobbler lessons not settle at nearly the absolute maximum price that anybody around would pay to be allowed to ever wear shoes again So people are noticeably better off because of shoemakers existing at all rather than being only a tiny bit better off because the selling price of shoes is so astronomical that it cancels out almost but not quite all of the real benefit that people get from shoes

Or thats how wed expect it to be in dath ilan

 if there were some powerful anti shoe magic about to take effect youd still only have enough food to maybe make it to spring if youre lucky and nowhere near enough to pay a fourth circle wizard for anything says Tonia Shes not sure this is a productive argument but shes pretty sure its not a revealing one

I want to ask about a generous fourth circle wizard who offers to cast the anti anti shoe spell for just one gold piece but Im guessing youll say that towns settle into an equilibrium where nobody has a gold piece to spend on anything because if they did one more of their kids would have lived and that kid would now be eating more food This unfortunately makes it harder for me to define the concept of consumer surplus around a counterfactual willingness to pay any more

So suppose instead I tell you that consumer surplus is the amount that people would be sad if shoes stopped existing They would on the one hand be happy never to pay for shoes again but on the other hand they would be even sadder than that because the shoes were worth more to them than what they paid We in dath ilan would expect people to be a noticeable amount of sad rather than just shrugging because they were only barely in favor of paying for shoes in the first place at standard shoe prices

 all right I think peopled be a noticeable amount of sad if the cobbler died Theyd say he was a lousy man and they dont miss him but theyd be worse off and not just barely

 and then that town never has a cobbler again and the surrounding farms who came there to buy shoes just never get shoes again I mean is that what happens in real life when a cobbler dies

Keltham is CONFUSED by the part about them saying the cobbler was a lousy man He notices the confusion consciously then sets it aside

I mean usually hed train his son but I was imagining if he didnt train his son so people figured who knows if wed ever get shoes again or just have to make our current ones last forever

So theres like lineages of cobblers each of which trains a single other cobbler to replace themselves and if a cobbler dies out prematurely all of Cheliax has one less cobbler lineage in it where did cobblers come from originally Wait are shoemakers a particular kind of nonhuman Keltham is increasingly confused but that makes it all the more important to follow wherever this is going

No He can take some other apprentice if he wants but since its good work hed probably rather train up one of his sons and theres certainly not enough money for two cobblers so he only trains one In the city probably cobblers take more apprentices

And the town that lost its cobbler doesnt just invite in a new cobbler from the city now that theres an unserved market there because 

 why would anyone want to move to a village in the middle of nowhere

Why was the original cobbler in a village in the middle of nowhere

DOES GOLARION IN FACT HAVE MARKET EQUILIBRIA

 he was born there

If cobblers live better lives in cities he could move from his village to the city If cobblers dont live better lives in cities why wouldnt one be willing to move to the village

 people dont like moving

Okay Golarion has some kind of problem I dont even know how to describe right now I check my current guess that we are not talking about just shoemakers here this is also shirtmakers and basically everything else Affirm

Spinning and weaving and tailoring everyone does at home Tonia corrects him But yes affirm that its much more general than shoemakers

 Whats spinning and how would you do weaving or tailoring at home at your current technology level

To make fabric says Tonia you shear a sheep Then you clean the wool and card it and then you use a spinning wheel to turn it into thread and then you put the thread on a loom and then you stitch it to make clothes

These people are supposedly very poor Where did they get all of this individual machinery for their personal house instead of having one machine time shared among the whole village

 its not much machinery And you want to be spinning all the time pretty much whenever you arent planting you wouldnt make nearly enough thread if you were sharing it around the whole village

Where are they getting the power for this machinery The town is on a river and all the houses are along the river and they all have waterwheels that capture the motion from the water to turn the spinning wheel

 you turn it with a pedal

I think that we should perhaps get back to the fundamentals of economics as applied to negotiation so that I can sell Cheliax the general and specific arts of making more efficient machinery

Next up is going to be the Final Trade Offer Game which shall henceforth be referred to as Ultimatum Game for brevity One person picks a split from 012 to 120 the other person has to assent to it or both get nothing

What do the Chelaxians make of this one wonders

Its the Rovagug situation says Gregoria which you solve with an oath if youre a god or a king or its very important

 note to self which is coming too late to do any good figure out why Keltham shouldnt just ask them all for oaths because if he does that everythings going to fall apart or everyone be forsworn by the end of the day 

And which none of you have the training to do she says which is false because they were just about to be deployed to the Worldwound but shes pretty sure it is worth lying about 

I wouldnt have expected anyone here to know how oaths work now that I think back on it using my current knowledge That takes Law well beyond the level of the stuff I was just teaching you along that same pathway and I wouldve expected it to be straight up too Lawful for Golarion period wait What does the Taldane word oath mean to you I know what it translates into in Baseline but that may be deceptive

No one else answers probably because shes now established that theyre lying and so they dont know how much lying theyre doing She isnt sure either The Taldane books did mention people taking and occasionally breaking oaths of fealty but Taldors not a Lawful country oh there is an angle on making Keltham not want to insist 

It is when you swear by your god to make a commitment in the way that gods make them where you cannot be the sort of person whod break them and if you do break them youve betrayed Law enough you lose your afterlife and your soul goes to Abaddon and gets eaten with some caveats

 okay in retrospect the situation where he was doubting her intentions right after they met where the alien with vital knowledge for her entire world expressed doubt about a statement shed already made and knew to have been honest might very well for all she knew have been that urgent but FLAMING SHIT CARISSA

What even is the POINT of doing THAT if the alien doesnt KNOW THATS HOW IT WORKS 

She didnt know he didnt know that was how it worked Though the absence of gods and afterlives shouldve been a hint 

Maybe she just didnt think of that fast enough Time pressure

I see Keltham says rather shakily Well no gods or afterlives in dath ilan so we try to understand enough Law that were governed by the same sort of Law that governs gods directly Which dath ilani short of high ranked Keepers cant actually do but even at levels short of that theres a shadow of the Law whose connection to us shatters a little more each time its betrayed not just for us but all across everywhere governed by math which is understood by society to be a serious affair When people write novels about aliens attacking dath ilan and trying to kill all humans everywhere the most common rationale for why theyd do that is that they want our resources and dont otherwise care whos using them but if you want the aliens to have a sympathetic reason the most common reason is that theyre worried a human might break an oath again at some point or spawn the kind of society that betrays the alien hypercivilization in the future

Humans on Golarion totally do break oaths but the Chelish students think that anyone who wants to murder them all about it is pretty justified though Asmodeus would probably collaborate with that entity on instead making them all stop by enslaving them 

I am guessing theological education doesnt mostly get into the details of this if youre training to be a combat wizard but I think that the thing you just said is also a shadow of why Asmodeus was angry when humans were given free will

Not quite valid under my own utility function but understandable for Asmodeus yeah

Anyways The Ultimatum game is the shadow of a situation that isnt rare enough in real life that you could afford to deal with it using solutions that require gods kings and risking your literal actual existence What other solutions can you come up with

I mean you can just have a reputation for turning down trades where you dont get much Meritxell says Or if you expect to be deciding the split about as often as vetoing it you can try to specifically play nice with people who play nice with you

Well lets run a trial then and see who can end up with the most hypothetical jellychips after 5 rounds everyone paired up at random in each round all results of previous rounds public Thats not the same instruction or incentive structure that dath ilani kids get their instructions are to seek more jellychips not the most jellychips but frankly Im curious what you peculiar aliens do if you get that instruction instead

The students offer and accept 50 50 splits all around

Keltham pauses them after round 1 Nobody can end up with the most chips if you all do that Keltham observes Dont get me wrong thats fine for the real life situation and its what dath ilani kids do with the usual instructions but you cant play to get the most chips that way If I already had money Id offer an actual gold piece or fraction of one depending on how many I had to the winner

Im not sure theres a strategy for ending up with the most beyond hoping other people fireball each other says Meritxell Or offering out of context rewards for cooperation but I assume were not supposed to do that either

Well I didnt tell you that you couldnt The less a game is winnable by ordinary means the more its implied that maybe youre expected to go outside it

Why didnt anyone try offering a 75 split

If you accept that then you definitely lose the overall game youre going to end up with a lower score than other people And since youve lost anyway you might as well burn them to the ground so they know not to mess with you

I see I suppose the same wouldve applied to announcing that you wouldnt accept any splits less than 57 Anyways among the tactics Id try in that situation is offering to generate a random number and split 111 or 111 based on that in which case wed each have a fifty percent chance of winning the whole game if we did it on the last round and nobody else had caught on earlier

 no one would believe you that you really did that though

Ah Clarification Its not assumed in these games that youre supposed to roleplay being not trustworthy Unless youve got a card from the older kids telling you to do that but at least at the age this game is usually played theyd always tell you in advance if cards like that might be handed out I didnt tell Meritxell to cheat with the card I gave her just for her to try to end up with more jellychips

Though in this situation if its the last round theres not much of a loss from carrying out your part If you both witness the randomness generation and it says you get the lower side of the split failing to follow through at that point just causes nobody including you to be the winner The game instructions dont say that you do any worse by scoring lower than average you either win or dont win Its a bargain where you dont actually lose anything from following through even if you lost which is part of the reason Id expect it to work even in a lower trust situation

Oh you mean if you use something publicly observable to decide which of you gets the split

Yeah my time telling device that attaches to my wrist wouldve done it but that didnt follow me here Anything with a precise physical symmetry will do though like if its got two identical sides you can toss it upwards while spinning it and you can both see which side lands facing upward

Totally random question I keep forgetting to ask how do you tell the time around here

Wizards usually have mechanical timepieces because you want to know exactly how long until your spell runs out Other people just go off the sun mostly

Someone produces a pocketwatch to show Keltham

Yeaaahhhh I kind of need one of those will talk to requisitions about it I guess

Anyways The next step in the economics game would be one I dont see a simple way to play here it involves a puzzle station that takes two players cooperating to win and the two sides of the game vary independently in how much effort it takes to control that side of it Once the puzzle is sufficiently solved one player locks in a split from 0 to 12 the other player has to decide whether to accept that split and the game station spits out jellychips if they do

The idea being this is modeling two people working on a task together only theyre not putting in the same amount of effort Its not easy to see from inspection exactly how much work the other player is doing And then one of the players has to decide how to split the rewards afterwards and the other player has to decide whether to accept that or if they both get nothing

What would you do in that situation What do you think we did in dath ilan as kids

 I dont see how that game is any different than this one Unless you mean theres not the reputational element

You dont have an intuition that in a game like that the person who worked harder should get more jellychips

Students glance at each other confusedly 

Carissa has literally no idea how Taldane students would answer that question so theyll just have to answer as themselves I mean if its a really atrocious amount of work and they dont do what theyre supposed to in school just because they want to grow stronger maybe theyll only be willing to do it if theyre promised a certain number of jellychips in return

 do you have an intuition that in real life if you cast a spell that was really difficult and exhausting to set up that morning youd want to charge more gold pieces for doing that

 I mean Im going to charge as much as I can for any spell right If a spell is laborious then probably its also laborious for other wizards so I can expect that fewer of them prepared it and that I can get away with higher prices but if I try that and Im wrong then Ill go on charging whatever price it sells at or Ill stop doing it if its not worth it at the price people want to pay me for it

Why are they so inconsistently economics

Suppose youre living in a multifamily home and theres this one big chore that nobody particularly wants to do so everybody writes down their price for doing the chore and everyone else pays whoever wrote down the lowest price to do it Theres no market in doing the chore its a one time thing thats never going to happen again Youd still write down a higher price for a chore you expected to need to spend more effort doing

For unclear reasons this example fails to land

 suppose theres one job thats really easy and pays 1000 gold pieces a year and theres one job thats really difficult and exhausting and pays 1003 gold pieces per year Youd probably take the first job even though the market rate for it is lower because the second job isnt worth enough more to make up for the additional effort you have to put in

Yep okay they agree with that

If youve got two wizards fighting two monsters to get to a pile of gold coins theyre guarding Kelthams rapid skimming has picked up that this is a thing though why is a much deeper and darker and more confusing question and one monster turns out to be a much tougher fight than the other would the wizard who fought the tougher monster expect more than exactly half of the gold coins

 depends on the contract they had going in

Okay and if a contract didnt just say to divide the coins evenly and the two wizards otherwise had equal job experience what would the contract say

Most of these students have not actually met any adventurers 

Usually itd say an even split or an even split with the option to take it to arbitration if one party feels the other was shirking or an uneven split because one put up the money for the expedition or had the tip on the password to the door or had the Teleport location or something

So the solution that dath ilani children immediately invent is both kids say on a scale from 0 to 12 how hard they thought they had to work and then the jellychips get divided in proportion to that I mean that wouldnt reliably work at higher stakes except between lovers or cofounders and if youre doing something with a hundred people you need a more objective and third party way to measure efforts but if two people were just tidying a friends house for money or some such saying intuitively how much effort you put in and dividing the payment accordingly would be very ordinary Do you have anything like that anywhere

Obviously everyone would lie to themselves if necessary so its an incredibly stupid system She doesnt say that

You dont want to reward effort says Meritxell you want to reward results If two people cleaned the same amount and one found it easy and one found it hard you dont want to give the one who found it hard compensation for their finding it hard You might compensate them for the work but not for the effortfulness unless youre their teacher or something and trying to build their character for some reason

That works great and wed do that as a matter of course any time we had a reliable way of measuring how much work got done of how much intrinsic difficulty When youre tidying a house you cant measure area tidied to determine work done it takes more effort to tidy a kitchen than a bedroom and not in any standard way If two people are going in without any prior reason to believe one of them is more efficient than the other how hard they worked is an obvious if imperfect proxy for how difficult the job actually was 

I keep thinking that maybe the answer is that Golarion is a lower trust society than dath ilan and people are too scared the other person will lie about how hard the job was or how good they are at it which I mean youd almost have to be lower trust given everything but that doesnt answer why lovers or cofounders or even just very good friends would never make an arrangement like that

I mean says Gregoria they might But youre not supposed to have lovers or cofounders in school and you dont really have side jobs so we wouldnt know even if thats how some people do things privately

 right Well dath ilani kids invent the 0 12 scale and divide rewards proportionally to how hard they thought they worked and that succeeds for them their spoken intuitive estimates are usually pretty close to the actual difficulty calibrations on the machines You have to hand out concealed cards telling some of the kids to be dishonest in their work estimates if you want to break that up

It sounds like Cheliax might need to do other training differently earlier in the sequence than this if they want to get that same result with kids

I think so

Keltham describes the sad situation which eventuates when you do hand out dishonesty cards to kids They work hard propose splits that they guess are fair not being able to trust the other person and then sometimes those splits get rejected The kids get angry There is shouting They get sent home for the day without having a solution shown to them because its good for them to sometimes dwell with problems that dont get solved immediately

He doesnt tell them about younger Kelthams emotional difficulties with being asked to act out a dishonesty card he has a sense that Chelaxians would have trouble relating for some reason Maybe theyd say that even at age seven you should be able to understand that the game isnt real and just do what the card says

If Keltham has understood correctly Cheliax considers the obvious game solution to be even splits of jellychips irrespective of work difficulty which is repeatedly randomly unfair and hence asymptotically fair Going into any one game you are equally likely to get faced with a harder or an easier task for your fixed payment and if you repeat that often enough the expected unfairness as a fraction of all payments will drop as the square root of the number of repetitions Its not actually too bad as solutions go

Still if Cheliax already has a better solution to the dath ilani game or to the real world situation that it stands for Keltham stands ready to hear it

Nope thats Cheliaxs solution 

Keltham presents the standard solution in dath ilan to the Ultimatum game If they offer you 66 accept with probability 100 If they offer you 75 accept with probability slightly less than 6 7 If they offer you 84 accept with probability slightly less less than 6 8

Does anyone want to try and guess the reasoning behind that solution in advance of it being stated

I see why it creates good incentives for the person who is deciding splits Meritxell says I dont see why the person deciding whether to accept splits or not has any incentive to do it if they cant establish a reputation for it and its hard to establish a reputation for doing something sometimes

Well reputation wise its definitely easier to have a reputation for doing something if everyone in your entire Civilization got trained to do it at age seven or eight

 I see why youd want to require everyone to do it yeah Itd be hard to catch them fudging if were talking about random peasants but maybe that still keeps the incentives reasonable

I think this is a place where I have the same reaction you had to burning down schools People dont need to be required to behave like that to be accepted for residency in a city its just in their own interests to behave that way Nobody wants to get a reputation as that weird person who accepts 111 splits and is very easy to take advantage of At least nobody I know wanted it Limyar doesnt count he was totally trolling

The thing Id expect people to be tempted to do especially in a big city where they dont have much individual reputation is make a show of using the randomization but take the split ten percent more of the time says Meritxell So you get a bit more money but its not obvious youre doing something exploitable which means it isnt exploitable But obviously its bad for everyone if everyone can predict that lots of people will do that so we will be better served if the Crown prohibits that

Suppose I put to you Two gods interacting in the Ultimatum game would use the pattern I just showed you even if they had no reputations and would never meet again

 yes of course

Civilization in dath ilan usually feels annoyed with itself when it cant manage to do as well as gods Sometimes to be clear that annoyance is more productive than at other times but the point is well poke at the problem and prod at it looking for ways not to be perfect but not to do that much worse than gods

If you get to the point in major negotiations where somebody says with a million labor hours at stake If thats your final offer I accept it with probability 25 theyll generate random numbers about it in a clearly visible and verifiable way Most dath ilani wouldnt fake the results but why trust when its so easy to verify The problem youve presented isnt impossible after all for nongods to solve if they say to themselves Wait were doing worse than gods here is there any way to try not that

Meritxell looks slightly like shes having a religious experience for a second before she snaps out of it All right she says quietly

Once youve arrived at a notion of a fair price in some one time trading situation where the seller sets a price and the buyer decides whether to accept the seller doesnt have an incentive to say the fair price is higher than that the buyer will accept with a lower probability that cancels out some of the sellers expected gains from trade The buyer also doesnt have an incentive to claim the fair price is lower than they think it really is The seller wont actually adjust their price if they think a lower price is unfair and the buyer will have to follow through by accepting with a lower probability which destroys a big chunk of their own expected gains from trade and doesnt get them a different price even if the random number says to accept

The initial notion of a fair price has to come from somewhere from the part of yourself that initially suggested 66 in the Ultimatum game which reflects a bit of Law Ill describe later but once you get that notion of fairness from somewhere and put a system like this around it no seller has an incentive to claim an unfairly high fair price and no buyer has an incentive to claim an unfairly low fair price And if they happen to honestly disagree about that anyways in some ambiguous situation theyll still complete the transaction with very high probability so long as they only disagree a little

That roughly is how bargaining works in dath ilan over one time trades If somebody offers a price the other side thinks unreasonable the other side says That strikes us as an unfair division of gains even if mutually beneficial as such but if you made that your final offer wed generate a visible random number and accept with 10 probability And then the price setting side can potentially offer further arguments about why the trade is more valuable than it looks or make a better offer or accept that low probability

The bargaining process Carissa described earlier for selling my shirt sounded like people were probably trying to sort of flail at that underlying structure by acting like they might be very unlikely to take an offer or be moderately likely to take an offer as they got closer to an agreeable price But with a lot more weirdness acting in Baseline wed say LARPing Maybe because they think they have to pretend a lowball offer isnt mutually beneficial at all in order to justify rejecting it and also with some incentives to be misleading because the underlying signals arent as precise and legible as saying 10 and theres an incentive to exaggerate but then the other side knows youre probably exaggerating so you exaggerate even more and you get people saying these exaggerated statements that both sides know arent true but theres uncertainty about how much the speaking side thinks theyre really exaggerated and modulating that uncertainty ends up being the medium of communication At least that was my attempt to decode what Carissa described

That sounds right

If I imagine trying to negotiate a 256 page merger between two large companies with 1024 clauses I cant actually see how the Golarion method would scale if you dont know about explicit acceptance probabilities Every time you wanted to negotiate one clause youd need to be ready to walk away otherwise staking 100 of the success probability because otherwise they dont have any incentive to give in But theres no way that would scale across 1024 clauses without triggering once maybe the walk away claims are mostly bluffs wow what a concept to have a single syllable word for but the other side isnt sure youre bluffing each time they call it Does Golarion just not do large complicated contracts by dath ilani standards or 

I I dont think you could have a contract with that many clauses no The Worldwound treaty has five Wars are sometimes settled with lots of terms but generally only if one side gets to impose them and doesnt have to negotiate them

Yeah we go higher than five And theres reasons we do that because were not fans of complexity that can be eliminated without cost so its not of zero economic importance to have contract negotiations that scale better Subject of potential interest to Asmodeus specifically or am I misreading the part where hes a god of contracts

Definitely of interest to Asmodeus Meritxell says Soul contracts have a lot of terms and maybe Asmodeus is secretly annoyed that Chelish people dont negotiate them more but you know the standard works and devils can run rings around you so its stupid to really

You couldnt have covered this topic FUCKING YESTERDAY

Asmodia realizes her hand is clenched into a white fist and quickly relaxes it before anybody sees but with the connection to compacts finally spelled out she can now see how even if she wouldnt plausibly have suicided and gone to Hell directly she could have sworn to do that with a probability inconvenienced them with some probability and had any negotiating leverage at all 

Too late Why it is always always too late for everything

Keltham goes on to cheerfully describe how the dath ilani children returned the next day and told of the solution to the Ultimatum bargaining game and the concept of fairness now blitz through the previous emotional difficulties of the Uncertain Labor Difficulty Game

No more anger and shouting Yes sometimes somebody says your offer isnt fair and you say it is fair and they generate a random number and the random number says that neither of you get anything and that is a little sad

But you know that they didnt claim that unfairness in order to try and profit at your expense you know the incentives werent like that for them

And they know you didnt state your offer in order to try and profit at their expense they know the incentives arent like that for you

You know they know you dont have the incentive to cheat so you know that when they state a higher price than you think is fair and end up rejecting your offer they werent trying to punish you for trying to cheat with a lower price

You can see how if you kept on playing this game for a bit pretty soon both sides would learn to converge on a similar concept of fairness and fewer offers would get rejected

 does this actually outperform continuing to split evenly though Since sometimes offers get rejected I guess continuing to split evenly doesnt appropriately train skill in having a shared concept of how labor translates to offer distribution And its good for people if the whole society has a shared notion of that what goes wrong if the whole societys shared notion is in fact effort doesnt matter only outputs

Well theres two components I think to my answer to that

The first answer is that outputs arent always legible and then you have to appropriately incentivize peoples fairness on valuing the outputs In the version of the training game that the kids got how much effort they had to put in wasnt fully legible but the outcome of the game being won was visible and unmistakeable But suppose somebody is making a shoe how good of a shoe is it exactly Maybe you could pay a trained third party shoe evaluator to come in and say exactly what they thought it would be worth but measuring your output objectively like that is expensive What we have instead is the partially legible output of a shoe where the quality of shoeparts or the evenness of the make or whatever it is that people value in Golarion shoes might not be clear and objective to the point where the shoemaker and shoebuyer couldnt possibly disagree on it So then they need to both reason in a way that incentivizes fairness from the other without everything shattering with probability 1 in the presence of a small disagreement

 like theyre already doing when they barter over the shoe but properly That makes sense

The second component is something where I feel more like I know what my teachers would say than like I really know the answer These of course are vastly different internal subjective sensations that no dath ilani would confuse What I think theyd say is that the amount of human interaction and endeavor where we mutually benefit one another in a way that we negotiate explicitly where we could possibly pay to have a third party evaluate the outputs is the tip of an ice floe you dont have much ice here Is the thin tip of a pyramid whose much larger base is all the places where people cooperate with each other without explicitly negotiating a price in money Can I arrive a little late to our meeting Oh sure they say Somewhere in the back of their mind you expended a tiny bit of your social currency with them and they now think you owe them a tiny bit of debt or cancel a tiny bit of debt they used to consider themselves to owe you And youll also keep track of how much you fairly owe one another in implicit favors like that and if the two of you disagree on that a little it should only cause a breakup with very small probability but if the divergence gets wider maybe the two of you dont want to deal with each other anymore When you dont even stop to negotiate and no money changes hands matters are in a much less legible place still and youre relying to an accordingly greater degree on people being implicitly fair in how they reward effort or output which means that the surrounding structure which incentivizes that implicit fairness matters even more

Im sort of skeptical about to what degree you really need all those implicit exchanges and couldnt maybe just pass small bits of money back and forth more often like maybe in the world made of Kelthams they just do that But also Ive never tried it so maybe my imaginary teachers are right in what I imagine them saying that it wouldnt work or it would just be more inconvenient without helping much

Maybe all of this is hacked together because you cant just light people on fire a bit when they deserve it she should not discard any pieces until shes totally sure she understands how they function though 

So in the example with your shirt says Meritxell the other person just says out loud I can make 10million gold pieces with that shirt and you just say out loud I value it one million gold pieces and then they do some math and figure youll accept a trade of 55million or trades of less with less probability But what stops them from saying in the first place I can make five million gold pieces with that shirt when they can make ten

At this point were just assuming that you have any guess about what its worth to them Ah but before I move on along the path it seems prudent to include any warnings about stuff they warned us hard about so 

Civilization emphasizes really hard to kids at this point that when you reject a 75 split with probability lt6 7 youre not trying to spitefully punish the person just make sure that their incentive curve slopes slightly downward as it moves away from what you think is fair If you were trying to spite them in accordance with base instinct youd reject with probability a bit greater than 5 7 so that they lost almost as much as they tried to gain at your expense even spiteful entities obviously will still subtract epsilon from their spiteful punishments to avoid the possibility of infinite resonating spitefights that even they dont want

Keltham has no particular reason to think Chelaxians are likely to make that particular error but dath ilan emphasizes it hard to children so its probably important or a plausible error that somebody might otherwise make

 because theres no benefit in spitefully punishing shoesellers or fellow students for wanting to trade with you

What would the benefit be I think the point of the warnings is that theres this thing built into human nature where our ancient ancestors mated and reproduced under conditions where people hitting each other and hitting back was much more of an equilibrium and now we have instincts that are about that But incentivizing fair strategies in the Ultimatum game is not about that it is a different structure that reflects a different bit of math than the non ideal pseudo equilibrium bit of math that got incarnated into hitting people back when they hit you But but it involves somebody else doing something you think is unfair and then you make sure you do something that causes them to lose some expected value even if that thing is just not trading with them So its the sort of thing that could map onto the hitting back instinct if you werent specifically warned not to map it onto the hitting back instinct

Imagine that room full of children if you told them that any time somebody made them an unfair offer and tried to cheat them they ought to hit back in a way that made sure the person lost even more value than they tried to steal to teach them a lesson no matter how much more that cost their own position in expected value Those kids wouldnt grow up to be dath ilans Civilization Possibly they wouldnt grow up to be any civilization at all

The room full of Chelish students nods seriously The children would try to hit someone and that someone would cave their skulls in and thatd be a waste of a lot of state resources educating those children

This is only true if you have a very limited conception of hitting back Carissa thinks She isnt sure not yet but it really does feel like theres a way to lock an additional piece on a way that you can get even cleaner and higher performing results with fewer deals walked away from less value left on the table If youre not Good and unwilling to do anything thats punishment if you think you have some duty to keep people in the game when in reality they were born into the game and the only way out of it is their utter destruction The whole point of pain possibly not the whole point of pain but a lot of it is that its a deterrent that can be delivered without destroying any value at all Dath ilan doesnt have one of those so all the rules have to assume that there isnt one 

Onward in the sequence On the next day the children are introduced to their first sophisticated trading game with tokens that produce varying quantities of jellychips in the presence of other tokens and which brought together in sufficient quantity can even produce more tokens

Despite everything the kids have learned the game collapses quickly and with an escalating level of shouting What do you guess the kids do wrong

 tried to do central planning without a command structure

 you know I think that thought never occurred to a single one of us To be fair we werent paying very much attention at that age to how the Legislative or Executive branches of Governance were set up but I guess we knew enough to elect a leader with some simple ranked voting system It would have made sense to try that not knowing any better solutions but we didnt

What actually goes wrong is that children with rare tokens decide that rarity is the key determinant of fair cost children with tokens that directly produce a lot of jellychips decide that direct jellychip production should be the starting anchor on price and children with tokens that can help produce more tokens think their tokens are way more valuable than anything else around

It is good to hear dath ilani children described doing normal things like rationalizing their getting more stuff than other people 

Now this is a problem mainly of the kids not having full power in their forward reflectors thats the part of the brain that implements Wisdom sort of obviously its more complicated than that Adults could just notice that internal self favoring influence and switch it off When we get to the point of being able to run experiments like this in Cheliax with 18 Intelligence 7 year old kids whove otherwise had an optimized upbringing I predict that tapping them all with an Owls Wisdom and telling them to try to avoid self favoring biased estimates will be enough to get trade restarted

But that just leaves the obvious question a biased estimate of what What defines the fair amount for each child to get based on the tokens they hold if we assume in game that its fair for them to start out holding those tokens Theres no object level effort in this game its just about putting tokens down next to each other Nobody can be said to be trying any harder nobody can be said to be trying any more efficiently The outcomes are perfectly predictable and perfectly measurable So whats fair How would Cheliax solve that problem or how would you do it if you think you know a way better than Cheliaxs standard

You could try to calculate what can be accomplished by all the tokens together and then all the tokens minus any specific one and thats that persons share though theres no reason to pay everyone that much you could normalize it 

Not bad Especially for a first suggestion Now suppose I arrange matters such that every tokens marginal contribution defined exactly as you defined it is zero Each of 12 people gets a token Any number of tokens from 0 to 10 will produce 0 jellychips any group of 11 or 12 tokens produces 12 jellychips What now

 well if you were a god you could calculate the tokens marginal value in all possible subsets of all of the tokens and do something with that Which I mention only because sometimes apparently if gods can do it dath ilan can too Gregoria says Shes pretty sure once youve sold your soul you can just say things like that

If all the tokens are identical like that you probably just want to split evenly I know that was just for the example but itd simplify the math you have to do in the version Gregoria just proposed if you treat interchangeable tokens as having the same payout 

That was a faster progression to the Law inspired answer than Keltham was expecting Maybe something about the exact way Keltham asked the question managed to prompt that answer Or maybe it really is the sort of thing where most arbitrary aliens will arrive at the same answer which is a small piece of good news about the general cooperativity of Reality

Yes indeed sometimes you can take an ideal agent calculation whose naked specification is too large for even gods to compute and either simplify it to an exact answer or get a good and fast approximation of it

Keltham whiteboards a sum over every possible permutation of 12 tokens pausing to explain dath ilani math symbols like all permutations and initial string up to first appearance of this symbol For every possible order in which the tokens could be arranged consider the marginal production that token adds on the step its added 0 10 produces 0 11 12 produces 12 Then divide that sum by the number of permutations

This sum has 479 million 1 thousand 6 hundred terms Keltham says Ive already finished adding them up How are you doing on that

See if hed said that yesterday no one wouldve bet against him being a sadist

The sum is also 479 million 1 thousand and whatever it was Asmodia says People who arent Keltham can tell that shes not saying it as triumphantly as she should be to Keltham she is liable to sound exactly like the same cheerful person as always

Mm And you got that by

Dividing 479 million which is what you said by twelve and then multiplying by twelve If the others cant figure anything out from that its their own damn problem

 thatd work if every term is one But they just agreed it wasnt But it averages out to one But how would you prove that

No one voices any confusion because theyre too Chelish for that

Summary of what the fuck is up with Asmodia from whoever is mindreading her please

The poor dear really didnt want to go to Hell tried praying to a nonspecific Good god to get her out of it in case Cheliax was lying about Good gods not doing that and had an accordingly unpleasant evening afterwards If theyd known this group was going to be anything more than a welcoming gift for Keltham they would have done better screening on her

Does Sevar want to pull the trigger on replacing Asmodia There were over one half responses to Keltham that could allow one of the girls to later reveal shes a shapechanged adult

Shes considering it

Its more lying

and a thing Kelthamll be mad about even if she manages to bring him around on Evil generally someone directly ending up worse off if he ever does find out

probably that doesnt matter because theyre not going to be able to bring Keltham around anyway

On the other hand you really really dont want bitter children with nothing to lose around your highly sensitive research project 

The thing she wants is to talk to Asmodia but this isnt a non heresy work situation at the Worldwound where sometimes someone just needs a drink and the casual but almost generous observation that they arent special and that therefore there are people whove survived being like them theres too much at stake to go off her gut 

Do we have a replacement candidate Give them that math problem and see if they get it right

Oh Asmodia has plenty to lose now She did sign away her soul as wasteful as that was and her Hell can always get worse

Theyll try the obvious replacement candidates on that math problem

That is a significant ask though Asmodia had the best scores in math if not in wizardry generally for this whole group If Asmodia had graduated normally shed have been tracked for spell research and ritual support after her Worldwound tour not Security Target replacing Security operatives arent usually tracked for mathematical talent theyre not usually replacing mathematicians

The result has to be that Ione states because everybody got the same kind of token there are 12 jellychips to divide there are 12 tokens and obviously everybody should get one jellychip So if were dividing by the number of permutations the numerator has to be the number of permutations too

Well yes says Meritxell but if the reason were learning it this way at all instead of just coming up with one jellychip a piece which three year olds could do is the permutations approach then we should be solving the sum instead of just noticing it has to get us the three year old answer It does though since eleven in twelve of them are zero and the twelfth is twelve Im not sure that even gods are doing the full math all the time but maybe its usually nearly that symmetrical

Keltham is starting to suspect that Chelish wizards do not routinely memorize 12 factorial 479001600 and didnt recognize the number when he said it which may make this problem harder to mentally chunk

In which case they couldnt have studied a lot of combinatorics Keltham would really have guessed that this bit of spell with 12 elements has 479001600 possible conformations would be an important chunk of spellcraft unless things only work at all when theres only 1 possible conformation

Maybe you dont get to that part at second circle

Or maybe this is a weird thought but Keltham is starting to feel suspicious of a trend Cheliax teaches combinatorics in some incredibly narrow way where theyve only learned combinatorics for spells and not combinatorics for everyday life

This probably isnt the most important thing right now file it with the other Why are they so inconsistently X

Correct but Im not sure everyone was following along with that so lets try a smaller scale version Suppose I took four of you lined you up in a randomized order you can imagine it being visibly randomized if you like and gave 8 jellychips to whoever was standing second in line On average how many jellychips should you expect to receive if I run this procedure on you

Two they chorus cheerfully

How could the answer possibly be two Theres four times three times two times one ways to pick the first person in the line from four people the second person in the line from the three remaining people the third person in the line from two remaining people and one way to tack on the last person in the line Four times three times two times one is 24 You get 8 jellychips at the end if you get any at all So the answer is going to be something divided by 24 different possibilities maybe 8 divided by 24 or something like that so the answer should be one third Or something with thirds in it anyways because youre dividing by 24 which has a factor of 3 in there

They stare at him warily

Youre second in line a quarter of the time says Tonia So its two Probably dath ilan does this kind of thing because of it being illegal to light anyone on fire so they have no other outlets

Illegal isnt quite the same concept when you dont have threats but lighting somebody on fire would get you barred from most cities yes since most cities contain people who prefer not to be lit on fire

But how does one obtain that result

You take the payout which is eight and you multiply it by how often you get the payout which is a quarter of the time and eight times a quarter is two

Keltham furthermore suspects that Chelish education may also possibly put more emphasis on guessing the right answer for spell problems than on proving the answer correct Which theres obviously a place for In fact if he were to treat them as kids an old dath ilani rule implies that Keltham needs to find a problem that forces them to use a more rigorous method rather than complaining that the correct answer was obtained too quickly You are not allowed to tell a child That answer was correct but I want you to obtain it my way instead of your way that is not good for kids And its not actually clear to Keltham if that rule is supposed to hold relative to absolute age or to mathematical maturity

If theres twenty four different ways to stand in line how does it end up that youre getting a payout one quarter of the time Keltham tries instead Shouldnt it be more like 1 24 or something like that

Theres not twenty four different ways to stand in line There are four places you can be in line and then you dont care what the other three kids are doing

I am supposed at this point to find some actual problem which forces you to compute it out the long way instead of complaining that you got the correct answer but you didnt get it the way I wanted which I am not supposed to ever do But I dont have a workbook full of carefully composed problems like I would if this were a real lesson unfortunately

If we were trying to figure out your marginal contribution to a more complicated economic situation though the particular people ahead of you in line might be important 

You know I should just give you a simpler problem that forces you to compute it the long way Lets say there are three tokens with numbers that say 2 3 and 5 Bringing a group of tokens together gives the group a number of jellychips equal to the product of every number in the group so if you had the tokens for 2 and 5 together the group would receive 10 jellychips

What does this method say is the fair distribution to the holder of the 5 token if three token holders pool 2 and 3 and 5 to get 30 jellychips for the group

So you sum up adding the five to nothing adding the five to the two adding the five to the three and adding the five to the pool with the two and the three says Meritxell and thats everything the five could possibly be worth in every world and you divide by how many worlds there were

Or if you actually bother to do the work 5 plus 10 plus 15 plus 30 divided by four says Ione So 15

Asmodia rolls her eyes Really What do the other two tokens get then The 2 and the 3

Ione suspects a trap and tries to rapidly work it out in her head For the 2 its 2 6 10 30 divided by 4 which is damn it this is harder to do in her head 12 And for the 3 its 3 6 15 30 54 divided by 4 is no it doesnt matter its not all going to add up to 30 Wait I see my mistake Ione begins

Mistakes Plural The divisor is 6 not 4 and youre supposed to sum over the marginal productions rather than the total productions If its ordered 5 3 2 thats a marginal production of 5 If its ordered 5 2 3 thats a marginal production of 5 If its ordered 2 5 3 the product starts at 2 and goes to 10 which is a marginal production of 8 3 5 2 goes from 3 to 15 marginal production 12 2 3 5 and 3 2 5 go from 6 to 30 marginal production 24 repeated twice Asmodia has been writing down these numbers thank you she is not trying to keep it all in her head without a Foxs Cunning 5 5 8 12 24 24 78 divided by 6 13

She quickly checks the other two numbers to make sure shes got it right

2 2 2 3 5 15 15 42 6 73 3 3 4 10 20 20 60 6 10

13 7 10 30 Okay she didnt just make a tiny bit unimportantly bigger fool of herself

Is she playing at anything by being prominently the best at math today

The other students are trying as hard as they can at math They dont believe themselves to have been instructed by you to diminish their math efforts as such Asmodia is just better at this problem

Unfortunately

Yeah the thing I was trying to force you to do with the four students in twenty four possible orders was sum over the 6 possible ways you could be standing second in line to make the point about how the sum is defined as being over every permutation In retrospect clearly I shouldve started with the case of tokens labeled 2 3 and 5 but Im sort of making this up as I go along because its been a few years and I dont remember some of the exercises let alone their ordering Sorry about that Anyways 

When youre trying to see if theres a way to do what ideal agents would do or gods if you think gods are powerful enough to be ideal about that particular case you want to distinguish the Law that defines what the solution is and any clever ways you come up with to compute the Lawful solution faster

When youve got 12 identical tokens such that any group of 11 or 12 of them will produce 12 jellychips theres a symmetry argument which says that each token must get one jellychip If you thought there ought to be a coherence constraint on the Law of fairness saying that holders of identical tokens should end up with identical payouts you could use that to compute the answer even if you had no idea what the actual Law was Often when you do see how the Law works you can go back over a lot of your intuitions and say Oh yes that intuition I had previously was shadowing this coherence of the Law even though I didnt know how the whole Law worked and thats a kind of sanity check on whether youre reasoning correctly at all

But the Law of fairness that defines the target answer for the 11 tokens of 12 problem is in principle a sum over 479001600 marginal productions of which all but 39916800 are zero and 39916800 of which are 12 divided at the end by 479001600 Which means that we can say theres a single ideal fairness formula that governs both the 11 of 12 game and the 2 3 5 game even if shortcuts or approximations for the particular cases of the formula can be different in cases where a shortcut exists

Which does imply that identical tokens will get identical payouts says Meritxell Right

Carissa does not want the kids to be bad at math Imitating being bad at math seems like another thing where the things Keltham would expect to be correlated wont be and hell end up suspicious which is almost definitely happening anyway but at least since its the product of their real legitimate math education itll make more sense to him as he learns more 

Carissa wanted to know whether Asmodia was being impressive on purpose because an Asmodia who is trying to get Kelthams attention or an Asmodia who is trying to be hard for Cheliax to replace an Asmodia who has started playing for her survival against the projects interests more than everyone in Cheliax is doing all the time is a different problem than an Asmodia who is doing her best but bitter because she had been consoling herself that Cheliax was lying about Good and they turned out not to be She thinks a disillusioned angry at Good Asmodia is probably usable She is open to learning from someone with more experience with this though

This is her being weak and reactive not strategic And shes quite pissed at the Good gods yes

Security doesnt explain why

Its not really the kind of thing that requires explanation The Good gods suck 

Carissa tries to think what Maillol will think if she tells him that she wants to try to talk Asmodia around It would be nice if she could predict what Maillol thought about things so she could stop bothering the real one so often but he still surprises her as often as not and she isnt sure if hell think this is Carissa being inexperienced at having a real command and accordingly stupid or Carissa having weirdly good instincts because Asmodeus dropped Keltham near her for a reason 

 she should focus on the lesson or shes going to get behind And then Keltham will think shes kind of stupid which might be good if it means he thinks shes not a ringleader but would interfere with attachment to her shes pretty sure Lesson it is

Yup Identical tokens getting identical payouts is one of several coherence properties that this solution has called equal treatment of equals Another example of an obvious coherence property is that the sum over every agents fair distribution equals the total distribution we dont have any jellychips left over Yet another coherence property is that combining two games into a single game will make the agents fair reward be the sum of their fair rewards in the component games Or another obvious sounding one if your marginal production is zero for every permutation your fair reward is also zero

Would you say those four properties sound like properties that any fair formula for a game like this one ought to have Again thats identical agents being treated identically distributing all of the gains the reward for playing two games is the sum of the reward for playing the games separately and agents who contribute nothing receive nothing

Those seem obviously true but theres still a suspicious pause while they try to think of counterexamples 

Did we get a technical definition of a fair formula such that split the rewards evenly which does not have the last of those properties gets disqualified

Oh at the moment we dont have any technical definition of what fairness is really just this one permutation based formula I gave you which I claimed might have something to do with fairness and four particular properties that might seem intuitively appealing for a fair solution So at present we could at best say that the supposedly fair permutation based formula doesnt split rewards evenly and that splitting rewards evenly violates the intuitively appealing fair notion that zero marginal production should receive zero reward

 nod

Buuut it just so happens that this here permutation based formula is the only possible formula that has those four properties Which is why if dath ilan ever runs into aliens theyll be at least sort of hopeful that the aliens also think this is the fairness formula as specialized for crisp games like these

This is how humans from their chaotic beginnings come to know Law Theres a sort of bootstrapping reflection seeing something inside yourself where you recognize the higher pattern and coherence within your own intuitions where you find four crisp requirements that seem obviously intuitively like they should hold if theres any way to get them that appeal to the pre Lawful notions inside you and those four crisp properties pinpoint and identify a single possible Law and then you look back at the intuitions inside you and say Oh so thats what it was reflecting thats what it was a shadow of all along You didnt know that Law when you first saw the Ultimatum Game but you gave that Laws answer of 66

Imagine having that having the true Law and thinking youd also better not hit the kids or they might decide its not worth going to school Chelish children will march through fire for that and thats why Cheliax is going to win

And so long as that gets transcripted and sent out soon enough hopefully nobody from Chelish Governance gives me a completely baffled look if I say that my baseline fair share of an increase in Chelish production ought to be around roughly the amount that Chelish production wouldve increased by adding me in the alternate world where the country had randomly half of its current people or gets confused and worried if I say that a proposed contract clause would be annoying enough in a final offer to make me visibly generate a random number between 0 and 999 and walk out on Cheliax if the number is 0

Now its time for a break or it would be in dath ilan anyways and it so happens that I hailed from there Ill take some questions and then probably go off by myself for a bit to let my brain cool down from recomposing half remembered lectures metaphorically speaking the brain doesnt actually overheat when you overthink unless something is going very wrong inside Dath ilani best practices would provide you with a small snack and suggest that you stand up and walk around Maybe a brief magic practice session after this to break things up Anybody who doesnt want to teach me magic which doesnt need to include all of you could take a longer break that way

Any questions

I do have some snacks if we should all have snacks Pilar says taking a pouch of small Chelish sweets from her bookbag wearing a cheerful smile She starts going around and distributing them to everyone Keltham first

But is she going to give them to the mysterious slave 

Yes apparently

Keltham consumes his sweet Not bad for this tech level

Thank you Pilar Im going to go get my headband Carissa says Probably Ill come to magic lessons but dont wait on me I might want to reread all my math textbooks first or something

No questions Keltham doesnt know whether that lecture was much less exciting for them than it was for him or if theres a cultural difference that makes Chelish students ask a lot fewer questions than dath ilani would

Well Keltham heads off to his bedroom

Broom follows

Sighgreat

Why did you say that you needed to destroy those papers before the universe noticed them

It was almost entirely a joke but in the unlikely event its not then you wouldnt actually be helping by calling attention to 

Apologies Broom says and immediately turns to go the other way

 okay maybe that guy is some sort of Keeper

Keltham goes to his bed lies down and closes his eyes for a quick rest

Meritxell does not eat Pilars sweet on general principle and goes back to her room to put away somewhere where she can check it later for being weird in some way Security wouldnt let Pilar poison them but it could totally be weird in some way 

Anything you feel like reporting to Security says Rodez Balaguerre whos leaning against the wall of a passage along the way

Pilars being weird Asmodias being weird theres a slave attending classes I dont understand why Sevars in charge She holds up the sweet not quite offering it to him This is a very educational environment Am I forgetting something

Oh Pilars being weird How so

She got Sever a cake And offered everyone including the slave who is attending classes these Neither of those things are heretical but theyre absolutely weird 

Meritxell isnt feeling particularly afraid It is possible she forgot something in which case shell rightly be in a lot of trouble but she doesnt think she did because she has a very good memory and one always might get in trouble anyway but theres no point being afraid of that itd be like being afraid of rain One thing her mother always told her was that everyone is powerless but only some people are scared

Oh I see Good on you for informing Security about those anomalous surprising events as soon as you reasonably could When did those events happen by the by

There is also no point in trying to defend yourself against the unreasonable implications of things people are saying any more than you would argue with the clouds about whether they ought to bring rain Pilar provided the cake at the start of the day and the sweets at the conclusion of the lesson about two minutes ago The slave showed up at the start of lesson with Kelthams knowledge And Sevars I think Asmodias been weird uh more subtly than that but it was most noticeable in the last half hour of the lecture

Take off your left shoe

It seems unlikely that Security wants them all running off to report at the start of lunch on things that Security already saw which makes it correspondingly more likely that Securitys just in a bad mood but theres no point in being afraid either way though the second possibility does suggest more options She keeps her eyes on him while she lifts her leg to remove her shoe I dont suppose Securitys allowed to explain things to us

Rodez Balaguerre breaks her little toe not in a particularly unfriendly way

This is a mission for big girls he informs her You are not adequately prepared for it You were intended as a welcoming gift for Keltham Somehow youve ended up with a great deal more responsibility than that This will require rapid retraining

Pilar is now an oracle of Cayden Cailean Thats the Chaotic Good god of drunkenness if youre too loyal to know It happened moments before Pilar could sign her soul contract Mindreading shows that Pilar didnt want that at all and that her request to be Maledicted if she needs to be executed was completely sincere This matches up with earlier records of Pilars thoughts being read and is not currently thought to be an oracular power for evading having her mind read Orders are to consider her an Asmodean in good standing for now

Her giving cake to Sevar was a manifestation of her oracular curse as was her distribution of sweets

You failed to report the former event for the entire length of the morning Had Security not known about this matter already and had the Security officer present also failed to take explicit note of the anomaly as every one of you did your failure to note Pilars unusual behavior and report it to anyone would have meant ignoring signs of a catastrophic underlying problem

You can have that toe healed at the end of the day or earlier if Keltham suddenly wants to sleep with you for some reason Meanwhile it is expected to provide you with a recurring reminder of the new level of Security awareness that is now required from you

Broom is here by direct authorization of the Grand High Priestess and belongs to a Lawful Neutral god whose work conduces to Asmodeuss purposes He is not authorized to give you orders and you should show him neither deference nor disrespect

Highpriest Maillol has decided that Sevar seems to have the best current understanding of Keltham of anyone present including himself In the unlikely event that you prove to understand Keltham even better Maillol might put you in charge instead Try sabotaging Sevar to make yourself look better by comparison and Maillol will hurt you enough to mildly improve your soul before sending it onward to Hell

Asmodia earned a punishment the previous evening but is not currently considered by Security to be an ongoing problem

Youre done here Put your shoe back on

 fair enough Thank you she says sincerely and puts her shoe back on and determinedly walks without a limp down the hallway though it takes a great deal of effort 

Carissa notices herself feeling wary as she approaches the temple which is probably that human flaw Keltham identified earlier where if bad things happen to you in a place your idiot brain will try to conclude the place is bad She wouldnt have noticed before but shes paying more attention to her flaws lately 

However this is probably not the moment to try to fix them Shell just go in and learn what ridiculous things have happened in the last three hours and get her headband and figure out what to do about Asmodia 

Maillol will have a chat with her that is a lot like the one that Rodez Balaguerre just had with Meritxell It will involve Maillol taking hold of her arm breaking her wrist and shaking it for emphasis while he lectures her but hell heal her afterwards unlike the other girls because he does not want Sevar distracted on an ongoing basis or Keltham noticing anything if he suddenly drags her off for a quickie

Nothing horribly unexpected has happened in the last three hours Nobody is to make any humorous comments about that because nobody is to tempt fate

Carissa would not even consider making comments about that Fate is clearly already incredibly tempted around here despite having as far as anyone knows been extinguished a century ago

She puts her headband back on Its nice how shes not going to have to take it off this time 

Theres no arguing that the girls are all in over their heads Shes not actually sure that Security and Maillol are less in over their heads Contessa Lrilatha didnt seem in over her head and the Queen didnt seem in over her head and Aspexia Rugatonn didnt seem in over her head but everyone who isnt on that level might in fact be in over their heads 

Well she always wanted to be that good 

Its pretty obvious with a headband on that having a headband on isnt anywhere sufficient to achieve that Shes not sure a 6 headband would be and while Wisdom might be more useful than Cunning it doesnt solve the problem either The fundamental thing is that theyre trying to do something very hard with little margin for error and at least one god actively opposed to their efforts and while obviously being smart is necessary for handling that 

 Nefreti Clepati isnt dath ilani Being smart doesnt even mean automatically deriving all the Law and becoming one with it within the range that humans are capable of making themselves smart What she knows now is what dath ilan taught seven year olds in a couple days of classes and while she can feel that it has not only cleared up her confusion about what bargaining is that it has lit a torch that casts some light on a dozen surrounding things she can mostly only see everything she doesnt yet know 

But Keltham likes her And if he gets bored in a week then the other girls will be a week more prepared for Keltham to like them And while she tries to maintain realistic expectations about how long hes likely to take to get bored her actual honest guess now that shes smarter now that its a bit easier to split out which predictions are defensive predictions so she wont be sad about whatever happens what a flaw to have in your brain 

 her actual honest guess is that he wont get bored in a week That hell pick up additional girls at some point because variety is highly motivating but that shes already not interchangeable to him 

For some reason this feeling makes her wish that shed fixed the Queens bag so it could hurt her again However not flirting with the Queen was the smartest call she made this morning and shes going to persist in it even if it would be really nice to be in a lot of pain And shes not quite on terms with Keltham where she could run up to him and say for reasons I cant tell you I want you to break all my knuckles with a hammer hes not even there yet he wouldnt enjoy it 

She gives herself five minutes to spend staring out the window and daydreaming about things to tell Keltham to seduce him to Evil and then tries to steer her mind back on to business its probably too late to pull Asmodia aside in a not maximally threatening way but shell see if she happens to be able to catch her

Its way too late to catch Asmodia without a broken toe that hasnt particularly improved her mood Its been improved even less by being told in a smiling way that children will be children but it might be unwise for Asmodia to fuck with Pilar like she was thinking about considering that Pilar now has an extra two caster circles on Asmodia plus unknown Chaotic Good powers plus Security knows Pilar is more loyal than Asmodia is probably capable of

Shes not bothering trying to walk without a limp if Kelthams not around

The food here is substantially better than in Ostenso academy Shes gone to get a small snack from the refectory area theyve got some out probably in case Keltham or she supposes maybe some of the other people here want one Nobodys told her she cant

Carissa comes up behind her and takes one too Hey she says Youre not in trouble or you might be but Im not it Do you want to borrow my headband

Thats a very good way to get a wizards attention even under Asmodias circumstances She tilts her head to look at Sevar which is the Chelish equivalent of whirling around in shock That would seem very generous of you she says meaning why would you do that and whats in it for you

Maybe this is a test to see if she is capable of learning literally at all and will now report to Security after Sevar acts weird

Wouldnt it just I was really annoyed when it occurred to me as the way to get what I want here Especially because it only occurred to me with the headband on and I think wouldnt have otherwise Wizards more inclined to poetry than Carissa have described taking headbands off not 2 generally theyre talking about 4 but still as like 30 of the way to being dead

You can have it for the duration of the conversation and then long enough to look at my third circle spells all I want is for you to approach the conversation like Im doing you a favor and will keep doing that if it works this time

Accepted Asmodia says unhesitatingly She has no idea what its about but the offer is she suspects intended to be more than fair if so it makes that point well enough

Carissa takes her headband off and tries not to make a face about it Hands it over 

I noticed you were in a bad mood today she says Keltham didnt or this would be a very different conversation and perhaps you will get it together by the time hes competent to read us at all but I noticed And you know Im not worried about whether your incentives are pointed in the right direction Youre not an idiot youre very clever actually or this would also be a very different conversation and were the most carefully corrected batch of wizards in all of Cheliax at present But We are working in adversarial conditions here Abadar is mad at us and to succeed under those conditions our success needs to be assured from more than one direction Cheliax is doing its Chelish best to teach you how to handle yourself here

And dath ilan if we were dath ilani students would try to bribe you On the utterly stupid assumption if Kelthams telling it straight that punishment doesnt work or on the slightly less stupid assumption if we figure the smart people in charge of dath ilan lie to their people as much as our smart people lie to us and I dont think Kelthamd be very surprised to learn that that sometimes you hit a different corner of the motivational system when you dangle a bribe in front of someone She nods at the headband

Asmodia puts on the headband Shes ever tapped herself with a Foxs Cunning but theres said to be a subtle difference from the headband That with spellsilver to anchor a more carefully refined enchantment than a hung spell it can be smoother more supportive befitting something meant to be worn forever after

 she cant really tell the difference in the first rush of clarity it feels half as intense as Foxs Cunning but otherwise mostly the same

Mostly her newfound clarity is agreeing with her prior impression that yes her life is a complete loss in which nothing good has happened to her nothing good is ever going to happen to her and all of her goals now consist of being tortured less and staying out of Hell for slightly longer

Its definitely possible that having any prospect of anything good ever happening to her would hit a different corner of her motivational system Dath ilan could be on to something there Asmodia chooses not to say this out loud where it would be a pathetic plea for help if Sevar is running Detect Thoughts which would be sensible of her then shes welcome to the inward thought that isnt a plea for anything

Or alternatively we only got the lectures for seven year olds so far and dath ilans reasoning will seem much more understandable after a full week of lectures Asmodia chooses to say instead Irresistibly compelling even which I assume is why they had us sell our souls first Why not Sevar though that makes no sense And Abadars mad at us That sounds important

Well see we keep lying to his cleric Keltham has a bunch of divination today Detect Anxieties Detect Desires What do you suppose hes gonna turn up if he casts those and looks at you

Asmodia doesnt laugh out loud Even less so considering how fucked she would be And yet somehow its still funny What a lovely bed Hell has made for itself to lie in

Detect Anxiety might not turn up anything much you cant be anxious about whats already happened to you Detect Desires might pick up something Security doesnt want him to see The desire to be somewhere else The desire to not be herself The desire not to go to Hell Even with an intelligence headband on she cant think of a solution for that besides removing her which isnt a good sign no wait shes thought of one Shouldve written down on my paper that Id have a more interesting background some story that would explain why Keltham couldnt detect my own desires if Im about to get a blocking item for that

Wouldve been a good idea I havent got Nondetection for you but Security will Im not actually expecting him to try casting that one on a room full of students given how some of his other spells have panned out not today when he doesnt recognize it but maybe hell surprise me She smiles tiredly its not sincere but the insincerity isnt really pointed at Asmodia Now entertain me for a bit pretend youre in dath ilan What payment would you want for this such that youd be glad on the whole that you were chosen for it that you were born for it such that if you thought of a way to make it go better you wouldnt just think theyll kill me if I dont

The thought is painful to glance in the direction of Asmodia turns away from her first internal glance

Her first thought is that shes being toyed with That wouldnt be anything the least bit surprising but right now its running into a contradiction with something else

I could entertain you if you hadnt exchanged a headband borrowing for considering that you were doing me a favor Asmodia says A little compact between us probably a bad idea for me to break that Can she actually if shes sold her soul to Lawful Evil

Bore me then and give me a straight answer Look do I like you as a person No Im not that impressed by mathematical ability Ill have myself once I have time to study with the headband on Would I give you presents even if I liked you as a person No But this is either going to fail spectacularly in which case we will all die very shortly or succeed spectacularly in which case I will be rich beyond my wildest dreams and powerful hopefully right up to and not beyond my ability to keep my feet under me And if I can buy with that future money that I only get if I win the slightest sense in your heart that you want me to win well that might end up being worth quite a lot to me

Asmodias thinks that this is probably what it feels like to have somebody trying to buy your soul before she remembers that already happened yesterday and didnt produce anything like this sensation

Its pretty obvious to her what she wants now that she stares in that direction

Its the sort of thought that gets people killed maybe even people whove sold their souls Intelligence headbands are dangerous things she doesnt feel like shed have thought of this with the spell form of Foxs Cunning

And having thought it shes already fucked herself over yet again and might as well say it to Sevar Theres a story I once heard whispered about the Queen that if you piss her off badly enough shell turn you into a statue and bury you far down enough that even the Hellknights cant get to you to free your trapped soul Id serve someone loyally if there was a realistic compact for that to happen to me at the end of my life if I served at some realistic level thats actually in reach for me

Carissa knows exactly what Keltham will see if he turns Detect Anxieties on her because it hasnt left her mind since the Queen said it and shes pretty sure it never will even if she succeeds beyond everyones wildest dreams and gets a duchy out of it 

She doesnt say that Obviously But that leaves her with absolutely nothing to say nothing she can even really imagine herself saying Her planned grateful exit was I think Ill need the headband on to consider that but shes not sure she can say that about about the desire not to be 

 also its almost surely impossible not threatening or Security would have intervened 

And here I was hoping you liked you know magic items strangling puppies that kind of thing You know if I had an aptitude for spell research and a terror of Hell Id work on permitted forms of immortality powered by the hearts of babies or whatever Figure out what the Starstone does to the people it eats

Very few people ever pull off anything even close to immortality and Asmodia is aware that shes not that good at math to research something that very few wizards have ever figured out A lot of people want immortality Very few people get it

Then again the other form of the thing she wants isnt something that a lot of people want Maybe its genuinely easier to figure out what the Starstone does to the people it eats than to figure out immortality Though youd think if it was easy to solve that Galt would use that instead of their famous soul trapping executioners blade which Asmodia isnt interested in because the Hellknights will get to it sooner or later

I suppose a slaves bread version of that would be finding enough spells that destroy memories and rewrite personality that the person who goes to Hell isnt effectively me any more Asmodia says and feels a flare of awful hope as she does Remaking her to be a faithful Sarenrae worshipper might be funny shed be so surprised when she ends up in Hell Because fuck Sarenrae thats why

 giggle See if you work out something like that then youre not constantly constrained by wholl collaborate with you because I dont think thats even slightly heretical I know theres a ninth circle spell that lets you turn a person into a book and edit it Im certainly not going to promise anything on the spot but if you do a good job and get us to pull this off I would enjoy rewriting every page of your book

Asmodias wordless core pulls her thoughts back from a direction of looking where if she actually thought of any way of doing the thing Security would execute her possibly on the spot She doesnt even think about where she didnt look

Fuck this Fuck this again The only consolation for selling her soul was supposed to be that she could finally think her own thoughts

Ill think about it Asmodia says after a lengthy pause Id realistically want to be rewritten as someone like Pilar who enjoys it and gets off on it and would do great in Hell just in case its still me in there no matter what Going for contract devil when you grow up are you

Im going for getting to grow up I cant say I can relate to not wanting that but if you do a good job for me I expect Ill arrange you any stupid thing that takes me less than a month of my time That ball is in your court though presently Youll have to go study dath ilani thought and convince me that an Asmodia who wants something is valuable enough for the no doubt unpleasant series of conversations itll take to figure out a version of it Im allowed to give you

The subtlety of wording doesnt escape the notice of Asmodia wearing a headband Study dath ilani thought not dath ilani knowledge That sounds like a daring thought to think for somebody who hasnt sold her soul Who do you think you are who are you in fact to make promises like those You dont talk like a Keltham expert that Maillol bestowed with a little more authority over the rest of us

Asmodeus owns me and owes me nothing in exchange and Ill think whatever thoughts might serve Him it being hard to know in advance of thinking them Concern yourself with your fate Asmodia and if theres a promise its worth making you then Ill tell you why I can promise it

Asmodia gives a half nod of acknowledgement fairs fair even if she couldnt say whatever Keltham would say about what exactly makes that be fair

With a fraction of preliminary agreement to agree on something behind them its time to speak a little more frankly

What exactly are you looking for from me I thought we were here to coax useful information out of Keltham to get transcribed for the real experts That requires us to look harmless to a dath ilani to be pretty girls that men enjoy thinking they can teach and to make fast progress and show it to him so hell move on to more advanced lessons If youve got priorities that arent the project priorities and involve dath ilani thinking that we were told on day one was insane I need to hear spelled out what kind of merchandise you want me to have on offer And then I need to hear confirmation thats okay from Security with whom Im not interested in being in trouble though Id agree to keep it secret from the other students if you wanted

Maybe its not obvious if the thing you want most is to stop existing Why is that even a way humans can be insane I suppose I dont need to tell you this Asmodia but most people run into five kinds of heresy the first time they try having an original thought and we presently have a problem that we cant solve without a fair bit of original thought Im not of course an exception but I suspect that the five kinds of heresy I end up at are entirely different from yours 

I want you to think anyway You can end all your thoughts in and this is why I want my soul expended for magical power by the darkest of sorcerers if you want I dont care though do mind that your only route to that is to impress me I want you to try to understand the math underlying Law well enough that if we end up sticking more headbands on you you can derive things dath ilan didnt get around to teaching Keltham I want you to do well enough at that Keltham notices ideally but I actually think I care more about the math than the Keltham noticing and if you hate the idea of him noticing you in particular you can feed all your clever mathematical insights to Meritxell Who will absolutely hate not having come up with them herself

Asmodia thinks the same thing and doesnt suppress her small vicious smile Security if youre there I request confirmation that Sevars sudden interest in Lawful Neutral thinking doesnt mean she got oracled by Irori and that the Queen the Grand High Priestess and Asmodeus would be fine with this private trade

A wizard remains invisible but the spell hiding them and their Arcane Mark appear as plain as sight to Asmodia without need of Detect Magic which she prepared on sheer reflex this morning before realizing that she was being dumb

Confirmed says Security And just to fuck with Sevar in an allowable sort of way If the Queen wasnt fine with it she probably wouldve mentioned it when she visited Sevars bedroom this morning

Carissa several weeks ago cared if her subordinates thought she was sleeping her way to the top but that ship has sailed and circumnavigated the globe and soared off to become an airship at this point Besides sleeping your way that much to the top isnt even shameful So I think I offered a look at my spellbook she says instead 

Yes It was in fact very generous of you

Asmodia follows Sevar to her bedroom not the first person to do that apparently But at the point where someone can nab Abrogail Thrune II while not looking any prettier than Carissa does she is no longer a slut she is a shapechanged ancient dragon slut with nine slut caster circles and only a fool would anger someone whos as much of a slut as that

And along the way while shes still wearing the intelligence headband Asmodia asks herself what she understands about dath ilani thinking Theres obvious notions like theyve developed some inner thing like arcane sight that pierces through the Prime Material like a realm of shadows and sees Mathematics underneath it but Keltham already knows that and isnt being shy about teaching it to them Figuring out what they lied to Keltham about filling in the holes of his knowledge theres some parts that are obvious if you were raised Evil what a perfected Lawful Good society carefully hides from children and citizens of questionable loyalty sadism the possibility that you can hit people to get them to do what you want that you can force people to go on playing games they arent being bribed to play If Asmodia has an advantage in figuring out something like that it will be the math that they censored from him

Is there any part of this that she has an elemental affinity for The first day wasnt an unhappy one was as happy as any day in Cheliax ever gets between the moments of anxiety and being sure that Keltham was fucking with them They found out that its possible to glance at a country of half men and half women and pierce through the obscuring veil of matter to the Law behind

And the thought occurs to Asmodia then if she is for some reason allowed to think about dath ilani thinking that theres something about Kelthams dath ilani attitude in the face of difficult problems thats indomitable Wrong word and maybe Taldane doesnt have a right one Something that isnt expecting that students only get problems that theyve been trained to solve Keltham does ask if Golarion has already tried and failed to solve problems but only to know how difficult theyd be for him to solve not to consider whether they might be impossible You never get the impression for a fraction of a second that dath ilan itself would respect all of Golarions past hard work as meaning anything Why should they when Golarion could stare at a country of half men and half women for millennia bargain over shoes for millennia and never see the towering structure of Law barely a step out of vision that dath ilani seven year olds learn about from older boys

A lot of people in Golarion have tried to get immortality 

or get out of soul contracts

 but they werent dath ilani

If nothing else destroying a soul if Abaddon or the Starstone can do that at all or just putting a statue somewhere it will never ever be reachable again even by the Hellknights or Hell really doesnt seem like the sort of thing that a class of dath ilani children would give up on if a teacher gave it to them as a puzzle they didnt know how to solve

Though it sure would serve them right if there was also some way like that to destroy everything

Carissa gives Asmodia ten minutes with her spellbook and then requires her headband back And perhaps theyve missed Kelthams magic lessons by now but perhaps they havent

Asmodia would rather think by herself than be around Keltham right now if that wasnt an order

shes having way too many disloyal pre thoughts and should stay further from Securitys focus until they go away

Keltham is trying to prepare Prestidigitation this time just in case he has more luck with other cantrips than Read Magic It looks more complex that doesnt mean its actually harder to set up

Ione is in the library as always running Detect Magic and trying to describe in words what she sees happening over the spellbook scaffold in response to Kelthams attempted motions She hopes one of the people with actual arcane sight can stop pretending not to have it so they can cast an illusion of what Keltham is doing for Keltham to see

Meritxell is present trying to show it with thread but an illusion would be a lot better

Carissa has her headband back and likes it Security having Arcane Sight wont be surprising to Keltham and leaves the option of claiming its a ritual that takes a year or something maybe one of them can cast an illusion

Why would Security need to explain how Securitys abilities work Its probably just all magic to the weird ignorant kid But sure Security can do a realtime illusion of whats happening over the scaffold

Wait so that was possible for more experienced wizards and people didnt think to ask Security then because they were being invisible all the time Id complain about all the time I expended with suboptimal efficiency yesterday but thats actually kind of a hilarious Paranoia Cost and you get those when youre trying to be sufficiently paranoid

Is Keltham having any more luck at spelling now that he can see what hes doing

He sure is Obviously eventually hes going to want an intuition for it but its much easier to develop an intuition for it when you can see it

Is he having so much luck that he can actually hang a Read Magic or Prestidigitation cantrip

After a while more of fiddling with it yes

Oh flamingpoop yes hes going to be a wizard Being a cleric was fun and all most of the time but having his own magic feels a lot less like hes depending on somebody elses charity

How many cantrips can Keltham get He definitely needs Prestidigitation around for laundry but also hungers for Mage Hand and Mending and Message and Arcane Mark and Dancing Lights and 

He can prepare four in a day thats not a hard physical limit there are clever tricks one can spend months to years learning to prepare six or eight but four is standard once you have the basics down and going past four requires doing a ton more work on things like finding overlaps in the spells so you can stabilize them against each other which arent worth Kelthams time right now

He can only prepare four a day or only have four hung at a time Do his two cleric cantrips count against the limit

The cleric ones dont count He can only prepare four in a day even if hes let them go if he tries having let one go to put something else in its place on the scaffold it will bend out of shape actually maybe he should try it so he can see 

Sure hell practice catching Read Magic a few times and then dismiss it if he hasnt failed accidentally after 6 casts That spell doesnt obviously seem very useful except that it was a spell whose look and feel he remembered

Now prepare Mage Hand and Message Then if he tries to prepare Read Magic again hell be past the 4 limit right What happens

The scaffold doesnt look the same as it did when he started its changed shape on him in Securitys illusion curled and folded as hes laid spells into it The place where he wouldve started building Read Magic before visibly isnt shaped like that right now

Keltham will mentally review whatever hes presumably already been told about how the scaffold knows how many cantrips hes prepared and why people dont just get another spellbook unless nobody has explained this to Keltham at all in which case Keltham will ask

The scaffold changes shape as the spells are built on it because magic affects the stable shapes for nearby magic It was changing shape all along it was just less notable because there was still some available spell building space You can get better at scaffolding so you have space for more and more powerful spells You can get another spellbook and build another scaffold which will come out identical to the one youve currently got because the interactions that are shaping it are part of you not part of the spellbook

Hmmm Well Keltham doesnt see anything promising to ask about that at the moment Obviously he has unboundedly many questions like Do the Very Short People get fewer cantrips by way of checking that its nothing to do with spatial volume of the caster or Even if the limit ends up being 4 for almost everyone can you detect subtle changes in how fast and how much the scaffold collapses which vary by say somebodys cranial volume But not actually anything thats like important Well unless 

No such thing as a magic reset where you hit me with a powerful dispel that blows away all my current wizard spells and whatever sort of internal magical changes correspond to my having already prepared spells Dont actually do that now unless youre sure it doesnt get my cleric spells too

There are spells that can do that but that take a couple hours to do so they dont work on the same person repeatedly in short succession They wouldnt hit cleric spells They mostly intensely compress the process that happens naturally in deep sleep that relaxes those internal magical charges

Worth trying to prepare a first circle wizard spell or dont even bother until Ive prepared cantrips for a few days

You have to learn a bigger scaffold Probably not worth it today

A tall woman garbed in casual dress for low nobility politely knocks on the library door and then steps inside Sevar If youll follow me outside the Forbiddance Im your teleport for your afternoon appointment

Carissa gave this a bit of thought and decided shes just going to be truthful with Keltham that shes also spending some of her money on becoming prettier probably with a playful if you like that 

Shes not going to explain herself yet though She follows

Keltham is slightly confused about what sort of scheduling gap this implies he can neither teach anything for which all students should be present nor snuggle Carissa until she gets back but gets tangled up in uncertainties about local interrogating someone youre also fucking relationship norms for long enough that he doesnt want to yell the question loud enough for it to reach Carissa And then he doesnt remember the Message cantrip for longer than that

Well he has his own mounds of reading and learning to do

Im also to retrieve a cursed bag of holding the low noble says curtly once theyre out of library earshot

She hands it over How long will this be

The noble shrugs Hour or two Been a while since I had mine She examines the bag Used once emptied not recharged Confirm or deny

Confirm With a slight pang of regret but she is NOT going to flirt with the Queen

The noble tucks the bag away without comment and then strides swiftly in the direction of the nearest exit from the villa Sevar will need to half jog herself to keep up the nobles legs are longer and shes apparently stronger

Once theyre outside the bounds of the physical villa and heading towards the edge of the Forbiddance the noble speaks again Not interested in the Queens affections I take it Understandable

That doesnt seem like a question with a safe answer Its no flaw in the bag which was lovely or the Queen who was much lovelier

But terrifying to be around to the point where the prudent wise safe course of action seems to be ignoring her and hoping she stops paying attention to you As I said understandable

And yet one gets the sense the Queen finds it annoying when people try to do the prudent wise safe course of action at her Its a bit of a dilemma I am hoping I can just make her powerful beyond all our imaginings and then be forgiven my confusion about how to handle it

This wins a snort of amused laughter from the low noble A difficult tactic but I would expect it to work if you can do it

The noblewoman puts her hand on Sevars shoulder and casts a two person Teleport sorcerously not as a wizard spell

Theyre in Ostenso outside a discreet but very upscale looking shop Theres a sign in gold leaf over steel that reads Guillem Arnau and no other hint of what the shop does if you dont already know youre not supposed to be here

The noblewoman drops her hand Different transport will be provided when youre done Im too busy to stick around here Free advice Sevar though I may suspect it may come too late The Queen may choose to request transcripts of your thoughts If you thought about how the Queen was very pretty but too scary for you to want to be around her or if you considered using her bag again but decided against that only because you didnt want any more of her attention she is liable to take that as flirting back

Of course she is 

The Queen should of course have whatever information she likes in determining how to do exactly as she wishes she says

Its not as bad as it sounds She only does the statue thing very rarely and not to lovers who disappoint her in bed In your personal case I think youd have to piss off the Church and Asmodeus first before shed go ahead with it

Carissa has absolutely no context with which to interpret any of the sounds coming out of this persons mouth at this point Is she being reassured because shes thought to be an unhelpful amount of scared But telling her the Queen might come for her wouldnt seem to help with that Is she being mocked Probably shes out of place here in her Worldwound uniform and well aware that nobles tend to think that kind of thing is funny Is there a deeper secret message Why would it matter what Carissa thinks about what the Queen thinks of her Is she being told that if shes a shape that the Queen will think of as flirting back like it or not she should actually just flirt back But its too late The woman acknowledged it was too late Is it a test of whether she internalized Maillols lesson about it not mattering what she wants But even before that lesson she was very clear on the fact that if the Queen wants something you say yes no matter what it is and no matter how you feel about it Whats this persons angle

I have learned recently that apparently a lot of people have trouble looking forward to with genuine delight the process by which in Hell they will be perfected While I have many human deficiencies that make me an inadequate servant of our God I dont have that one and my problem here is not that it sounds bad its that Im sure there are lots of equally interesting girls who are slightly less busy

Under no reasonable models of this persons goals was that a very good thing to say the headband helps Carissa observe with perfect clarity

 shell just go inside To her appointment

She didnt catch on this time Thats disappointing but also kind of adorable

Abrogail did have other things to do with her time today its just when Sevars thought transcripts show her thinking every five minutes about how terrified she is of you its hard to help yourself

About twenty minutes into her beauty appointment which thankfully involves things being spread on her face and doesnt require much of even her unenhanced attention it does occur to Carissa that nobles who are also fifth circle sorcerers dont run miscellaneous transportation errands Security could handle 

Doesnt she have a country to run But thats not even a reasonable complaint really because everyone knows full well that this little project is the most important thing in it and that this little project will succeed or fail on Carissas judgement

And if it fails then if shes lucky shell go to Hell

Asmodia could not possibly be less relatable Carissa finds herself in fact utterly furious with her for having the thing Carissa wants more than anything else in the world and trying like a toddler too caught in the throes of a tantrum to be reasoned with to rid herself of it the only inheritance she has the only good thing about being human 

She does remember to ask if she can also be fitted for clothes appropriate to her hypothetical station 

Guillem Arnau does not provide that service but there is a fine clothier two streets up if madam customer is sure she can afford their services or if this is part of a government operation they can append a few words requesting clothing purchase assistance to the pickup request

Carissa has now gained a permanent 1 inherent bonus to Comeliness

Yes please on appending it to the pickup request she is sure she cant afford it 

Its not incredibly obvious looking in the mirror its the difference between how one looks on a good day versus on a bad day She could get away with not explaining it to Keltham except for the policy of only telling lies they actually need Also she wants to keep doing it so 

She does not yet feel like she has understood the desires in herself that have no place in Axis but well yes okay she has she wants to rewrite the book of Asmodia to have REASONABLE PRIORITIES and be GRATEFUL FOR HER LIFE thats not a desire that has a place in Axis but not the pride related ones Yet

Pickup arrives in the form of somebody who looks like a slightly tired that is not noticeably to anyone who isnt Chelish courtier who will escort Carissa to upscale clothing stores and buy clothing for her that a countesss heir should have Actual teleport to follow

Theoretically this decision gets made by Paraduke Ratarion but the person who received the initial message made a snap decision that his decision here was predictable enough to guess and be corrected if necessary In an Asmodean tyranny this is a bad thing to guess and be wrong about but not insignificantly a good thing to guess and be right about

A countesss heir apparently would have a lot of clothes more than are really feasible to own or wear or get from place to place a countesss heir of course would have servants which would help on the feasibility front

Carissa is not sure how much agency she is supposed to exert about the clothes acquisition process but she figures more countesses heirs err on the spoiled side than on the meek side so she tries to make demands which go over fine she wants fabrics that look like theyd be incredibly hard to do by machine because theyre labor intensive and sufficiently non repeating since dath ilan will probably find those more impressive a lot of laces are satisfactory on that front She thinks that Keltham will be unamused by anything that takes an hour to lace up so those are out 

She wants a dragonhide purse because dath ilan wont have that and shes tempted by necklaces that have tiny humanoid fae trapped inside them pounding frantically at the crystal but probably Keltham would get worried about them and ask if they want to be let out 

 this is just occurring to her do countesses heirs who have a sadistic boyfriend have shes not even sure what shes imagining imaginative sex clothes of some kind The obvious version would be like shirtsleeves that can lace together so as to bind your hands behind your back rather than lacing separately or maybe theres a particularly spiky kind of lingerie Fabric is so expensive that Carissa thinks of this as a fairly ridiculous indulgence but now that shes thought of it it seems like someone wouldve probably 

The courtier doesnt blink Yes Ostenso has several shops for government approved Asmodean subwear Most however target sufficiently wealthy people buying subwear suitable for their pets and slaves Theres only one such shop that would be socially appropriate to a countesss heir purchasing subwear for herself to wear of her own accord and that one may already be closed or closing soon

Inconvenient Can someone check whether its in fact closed or closing soon itd be nice to bring Keltham back at least one thing from this shopping trip

Because she is human and bad at the things humans are bad at Carissa feels what distress at the thought theyll assume shes just like this as a person Their opinion of her does not matter and if she were just like this as a person then her life would be more convenient and maybe she is just like this as a person with the right handling which she just hasnt sought out The embarrassment survives all these compelling counterarguments

The courtier isnt much of a wizard and doesnt have extra message scrolls theyd have to head there to look but its not that far

Sure Carissa is not pathetic enough to let embarrassment influence her She will go to the other shop Knock

Someone opens the door Were closing in thirty she begins but then catches sight of Carissas Worldwound uniform and the tired looking courtier next to her Were always open for the Church or the Crown she says a moment later

Good of you I need something to wear The intended audience is an innocent young man from a very Lawful Good country who is reconsidering what they taught him its all right to do in bed

The courtier adds that this situation is not any higher priority than would be appropriate to a counts heiress shopping at this store theyre not to bring out anything or offer any services they wouldnt offer to a counts heiress

Strange and interesting on both counts but the door answerer is certainly not arguing or asking any questions of this Obvious Intelligence Operation Shell quickly escort them to the relatively tamer sections of refined noble Asmodean subwear You probably want things labeled Perversion 15 through Perversion 20 she says

There are labels Theres a scale But presumably whats interesting is both highly personal and incredibly contingent on past whatever Carissa will trust the system What sorts of things have those labels

Perversion 15 Ballroom clothing suitable for a Baroness not quite at the Countess level elaborate but nothing that would overly impede a dagger fight if you had to do that instead of dance Cunning pleats and overlaps in the clothing would enable a lover to reach right through it for pleasure or punishment in any number of various places and angles without any need of removing it

Perversion 17 Loose slave garments and not cripplingly expensive to lose harem jewelry that would be suitable for a noble surrendering herself to a higher noble for sexual punishment after being defeated in a contest of wills and powers according to a not particularly legible etiquette code that absolutely does distinguish this case from the case of a noble who got physically captured by another noble and forcibly redocorated by them in which case obviously youd be shopping at one of the other stores instead because this store is only for noble submissives who are doing their own shopping Its not considered gauche or mockery to wear this clothing even if youre not really surrendering yourself to a higher noble and is instead a pleasing roleplay or flattery which makes it much more popular than the primary use case would suggest

Higher perversion levels spoilered

Perversion 18 A simply enchanted cursed belt which prevents you or anything youre wearing or holding from touching your own genitals used for preventing self stimulation It wont stop a Mage Hand but its at least a little difficult to get yourself off with a Mage Hand It wont stand up to a Dispel Magic and it doesnt have any indicators that would show a Dispel Magic had been used on it thats more the sort of heavy duty cursed equipment that a dominant would buy to use on a submissive

Perversion 18 also A whole body outfit of leather straps concealing nothing of importance studded with solid metal rings any of which can be locked to any other Youll need to also buy either these simple open or shut connectors which you could just as easily manipulate to free yourself if your fingers werent otherwise restrained or these more time consuming simple locks sharing a common key You could be restrained and re restrained in a very wide variety of positions using this especially if you also buy these simply enchanted adjustable length metal bars with rings on either end Uncaring use of this on you may require a clerics attention afterwards not that theres anything wrong with that

Perversion 20 An Asmodean fighters leather armor but interlaced through with subtle bands that can be tightened to reduce flexibility and resist motions handicapping the wearer If you were wearing this you could lose a hand to hand combat to a substantially less skilled fighter without it looking too unnatural The groin protection can be detached without that affecting the restraining power of the rest of the armor

Its not that large a store floor and even if Carissa keeps her focus relatively narrow shes liable to notice for example a Perversion 24 enchanted metal bra whose breast cups go searingly hot any time you make a sound a much more expensive Perversion 33 bra that sears you any time you disobey any order you hear decorated aesthetic versions of many common torture implements that dont require overly expensive for a noble clerical attention afterwards slave rags which sure look like ordinary slave rags except for somehow being four hundred times as expensive oh theyre enchanted to automatically clean themselves without requiring some random laundry wizard to use Prestidigitation for two minutes thats why theyre four hundred times as expensive and of course cuffs whips branding irons acid droppers and blindfolds with extraneous gold detailing and in some cases tiny rubies

In many cases one can tell on a close examination that this is definitely subwear that noble Asmodean submissives buy for themselves rather than subwear for Asmodean dominants to buy for their subs because the subwear is visibly designed in some way to allow or require the submissive to put herself into it rather than for her to be restrained while somebody else puts subwear on her Obviously this is a matter of fashion signals rather than practice its not like you couldnt threaten somebody into putting this stuff on

The male focused section of the store floor is smaller maybe a quarter of the size but very much existent for the benefit of that very very rare Asmodean who wanders into a store like this one and starts pondering anything to do with gender disparities

Carissa has never really given a lot of thought to how the nobility lives beyond deciding a decade ago she didnt want to be a court wizard because the mortality rate was appalling Her plan was to start a magic shop figure out who was the most important person to bribe make them something beautiful every year for a present and assume that sufficient to keep her out of everything else 

Her feeling now looking at all of this is faintly infuriated It seems very fake like theyre playing the game of having sex instead of just having sex like normal people Carissa is not actually sure she is very interested in the game of having sex She tends to have sex for advantage which means that when shes having sex its with people who have power over her rather than people she has power over but thats not a game thats just how everyones incentives are shaped This is a game The consequences are real but the thing itself doesnt seem any less fake for that 

She understands maybe what Maillol was trying to tell her that it wasnt all right for Keltham to have her because she said it was That comes from the same world as this a world where everything is a game where someone might decide to put on these clothes and seduce someone just because its fun playing with the inevitable natural order of the universe but only that playing 

Carissa is pretty sure that her actual sexuality which she unfortunately needs to keep track of because theres no time in her schedule at present to learn to fake it doesnt resemble this It is about belonging to someone with the power to do whatever they like with you yes but its not about belonging to them because youre into that Its not about the fact power is sexy its just about power It feels like a real distinction at least inside her head Insofar as it features clothes like this at all they were definitely picked for her by someone who likes her in them not picked out herself 

Okay setting aside her actual sexuality which being the product of a human mind is going to be stupid and incoherent what does she want Some of the fancy outfits that look like they definitely couldnt have been manufactured overnight as part of an elaborate effort to convince Keltham that masochism is a real thing some things that look like theyd obviously only work with the cooperation of the wearer some things for farther in project corrupt Keltham which dont as obviously only work with the cooperation of the wearer she tries to model Kelthams reactions about magic chastity belts and Keltham in her head is making a face but not a no face so shell grab that 

 she has a unhappy feeling that somehow looking at the more dangerous stuff at all counts as flirting with Her Infernal Magistrix Because everything counts as flirting with Her Infernal Magistrix or at least everything done in the slightest awareness it might have effects on Her Infernal Magistrix Anyway pushing Keltham too far too fast might make him decide to think too hard about the whole situation so she wont get any of that Yet 

I think this is enough for now she says once shes picked out an outfit for ballroom dancing which she does not do while sexually accessible which pants work fine for and the magic chastity belt unless youre apprised of the whole situation enough to have opinions and advise otherwise

Its hard to figure out which possible responses to that potentially get her hand burned off in a way that non government employees dont get free healing for Shes obviously not apprised of the whole situation which suggests that she definitely shouldnt say anything but thats too obvious to be the meaning

I have no experience or training in honeypot operations targeting unsuspecting Lawful Good targets Government approved literature has seemed to suggest that presenting yourself to a Lawful Good man in obviously self applied bondage gesturing at the outfit of leather straps will tempt him to do things to your helpless form without that seeming to hurry him along the path to inflicting pain and that tickling is useful as an intermediate step towards getting him to hurt you gesturing at a shelf of tickling implements and lubricants labeled Perversion 3 but I dont know if any of thats meant to be useful advice or a fictional conceit

Realistically shouldnt this be asked of a honeypot operator with experience targeting the boys home country But theres presumably some reason they arent doing that and instead asking her and also arent giving her any more information Citing only government approved advice is the only tactic she can think of for possibly getting out of this with mostly inexpensive injuries

Oh for fucks sake Carissa would just like people to say things if they think she should actually know them and not otherwise You know people say that the Worldwound is bad for Cheliax because of how most of the national wealth is going towards fighting an endless horde of demons but shes starting to wonder if its actually good for Cheliax because its a place where if you waste too much time or play too many games you get eaten which both winnows out idiots and is character promoting for everyone else Great she says shortly How much for this then

40gp for everything else and 340gp for the Cursed Belt of No Touch It would be more if it was an adventure grade cursed item and not a bedroom grade one

She glances over at the courtier in case she has opinions about whether Carissa is allowed to spend that much on sex toys

The courtier continues to feel nervous about correcting Carissa Sevar in any way even when she is seeking guidance let alone having any opinions on what Carissa Sevar is allowed to do but has nonetheless been instructed to make sure Sevar doesnt make any accidental purchases she shouldnt so

A countesss heir could own a small handful of sex toys costing that much but wouldnt own dozens of them This mission hasnt run out of gold yet though theyre getting close to the amount the courtier has on her

These both seem like very safe opinions to express and not ones that will cause Carissa Sevar or Rathus Ratarion or Aspexia Rugatonn or a suddenly appearing pit fiend to kill her

This background anxiety doesnt show at all to Carissa the courtier is experienced

Carissa is not very interested in peoples internal states as long as it doesnt cause them to waste her time or not tell her things Great then lets get these and then swing back to the other store for one normal outfit and they can take my measurements so I dont have to leave for future orders

If Asmodeus has taken a personal interest in that event happening the courtier isnt going to argue with it

The items go into a standard military issued common use Bag of Holding Back to other clothing stores

Carissa will get one nice dress that isnt a special sex dress and an undergarment for it and not ask anyone any questions they are too nervous to usefully answer and get all her measurements so that she can order future dresses that are even better fitted and then she can be done with this ordeal and hopefully not have missed dinner judging by the time she probably missed dinner

Keltham has acquired a timepiece that he will someday remember to check again Hes found out that Cheliax is 85 farmers implying that their food per person gain function is 7 6 117 in which case anything that produced a permanent 1 7 decrease in farming productivity would cause human life in Cheliax to stop existing There maybe shouldnt be all that many priorities higher than increasing the food per person gain on farming to something more like say 100 or at least 10 Dinner probably happened at some point he isnt really focusing on that

Keltham is currently experimenting with Prestidigitation to see if he can Prestidigitate things to be magnetic magnetizable or to have rotating magnetic fields inside them Hows that going for him

Making random objects magnetic no Magnetizing a metal in the fashion you could also do with a strong magnet yes Rotating magnetic fields he cant make it a persistent property of the object but he can do it very briefly scattering a bunch of iron filings in a suggestive fashion before it stops quite working 

Meritxell points out that if there were a permanent 1 7th decrease in farming productivity all the least productive farmers would starve but there is variance and some farmers are very productive and would be fine

What makes some farmers more productive Any clues

Can he make a loop of metal superconducting with Prestidigitation and then use this bit of iron he already magnetized to start an electric current flowing which will then persist Keltham has a detailed qualitative physics mental model of both conductivity and superconductivity if that counts for anything he wouldnt know exact numbers on how conductive a piece of impure iron would already be

Some places the soil is much richer so plants grow better says Tonia And near rivers its possible to irrigate the fields

Getting an electric current flowing isnt working and its not totally clear why

Fascinating If you can make something taste even vaguely like chocolate youd think you could make it support a superfluid of phonon coupled paired electrons thats much less complicated than the implied fitting of taste receptor potential energy surfaces going on with tastes vaguely like chocolate

Can he make something just exhibit the magnetic field expulsing effect so that it will float above a magnet even if its not a superconductor

The classic Science Maniac Verrez maneuver would be to see if you can use Prestidigitation to turn a very tiny amount of something into antimatter but that obviously Keltham is not going to talk about or try until hes got a much better grasp on safety precautions

Yep very briefly again like with the magnetic field and then he loses it and has to start again

Then Keltham is going to practice this some more because if he gets magnetic field expulsion and magnetism both working and if hes right about how things look to Detect Magic hes going to be able to show off an object floating above another object without any visible magical force holding it up which should make a nice Difficult Seeming Impressive Trick for Golarion natives if they dont already have any obvious ways for doing that

Carissa comes quietly in while hes still getting this down having swung by Maillols to ask calmly for confirmation that was again Her Infernal Majestrix

Keltham wasnt at the stage of being ready to attempt a visible Thing Floating Above Thing effect just bringing Prestidigitated objects closer together to see if he can maintain the repulsive force hes aiming for and especially while hes not actively casting the Prestidigitation spell This is good because he doesnt need to hide the preliminary stages of a Difficult Seeming Impressive Trick from Carissa who might otherwise be impressed by the completed form

Oh hey Keltham starts to say when Carissa steps in 

Shes dressed nicer and more normally though not in anything like a dath ilani style

Oh did you get back your non Worldwound wardrobe and stuff Thats a sensible thing for the trip to have been about

Yes well acquired a non Worldwound wardrobe I havent had one in mothballs for the last six years Also acquired some other things Ill tell you about later

Not bad for a low tech society Hed visualized non Governance clothing as being much cruder given the description of hand powered spinning and weaving wait is that actually incredibly expensive stuff that only third circle wizards on important government projects can afford Hell quietly ask somebody who isnt Carissa which he can totally do now because maaaaaagic

Ive been practicing economicmagic Keltham says Observe what I now do completely without a huge supply network to manufacture sound transmission equipment He goes through the gestures to cast and catch Message then mouths to Meritxell Do her new clothes look very expensive

Yes Meritxell whispers back smiling

Good news about Carissas career trajectory not such great news about the state of the rest of Cheliax

You also seem more generally cheerful Brighter If Im not just imagining things Said to Carissa normally

Youre very perceptive it is generally said that you need to get multiple prettiness treatments if you want a man to actually notice instead of just vaguely feeling fonder That is one of the other things I was going to tell you about later

Keltham peers at her more closely That could be a change to underlying biology that I interpreted as cheerfulness I suppose If you hadnt told me it wouldnt have occurred to me that your hidden background state appearance had changed Oh huh Keltham has slightly mixed feelings about that which he should put a pin into discussing sometime later should he mention it now so she can help him pin it no that seems like an ominous and unspecified thing to dump on somebody if youre not going to talk about it right away

Keltham casts Detect Magic just to see if he can spot any lingering magic on or about Carissa from it all

Nope 

Have you eaten yet Im afraid we already did

Ill grab myself something and come right back then

Hes about ready to wrap up After this comes Kelthams casting his mysterious cleric spells for the day though Keltham isnt going to mention that fact until shes done eating dinner in case its otherwise a nice mood spoiler Though she might not actually be in a nice mood just prettier still same logic applies

See you soon and again he says in a Baseline idiom that maybe didnt quite translate to Taldane

She hurries out smiling

More magnetic field excluding practice Also more infinite Additional Questions

Is the limitation on irrigating more fields the limited supply of water or the cost of infrastructure to transport water What if anything do you already do to try to make fields have richer soil

You leave the fields fallow some years says Tonia and turn the soil deeper

In some places they harvest bat shit from deep caves and the Underdark

Carissa requests a summary over dinner or anything thats come up and also wonders aloud at Security whether Asmodias been behaving herself better or worse or the same

Keltham asked questions about farming and other aspects of Chelish economics Meritxell and Tonia mostly answered them in a way that fits the hypothetical new Cheliax so far as Security could tell

Ione passed a note to Security offering to warn Keltham to maybe not trust everything Meritxell says about economics because she might be overrunning her real knowledge in a very enthusiastic and well intentioned way but still Security is deferring that decision to Sevar

Ione oracled in one Ostenso library book about farmers Security does still have the ability to redirect Kelthams thoughts away from text and farming seemed innocuous It didnt contain nearly as much direct detail on farming operations as Keltham had hoped no illustrations of plows or mentions of how much a plow costs or who makes plows and soon Keltham gave up and stopped reading Keltham suggested establishing communications with somebody at the Ostenso library who could check through books first given a request for content and leave a found book in a designated place for Ione to borrow One Sending is an improvement over two teleports or this potentially warrants a paired mirror Security told him that Requisitions said shed think about it Requisitions in this case really means Sevar they can get the mirrors if Sevar says yes

Asmodia has been keeping to her bedroom and rereading her math textbooks which is overtly good behavior She wasnt tightly monitored but spot checking of thoughts suggests that shes anxiously locking down a lot of disloyal thoughts nothing unusual for someone in her position though of course Asmodia isnt being told that but certainly more anxiety and thought suppression than would have been characteristic of her three days ago Overt thoughts indicate willingness to work with Sevar on her mysterious project for dath ilani thinking confusion about what the real purpose of that is painful hope that maybe she can avoid Hell after all

Pilar was almost but not quite killed when a Security wizard got a message announcing one of his wives had successfully birthed a child and Pilar shouted Congratulations from directly behind him Nobody including Pilar understands how Pilar got into the temple room where the wizard was receiving the message and Pilar cant quite remember what she was doing just before that Pilar thinks she could possibly learn to not do it to on duty Security so long as she can still do it sometimes to somebody but on this occasion the impulse took her by surprise Pilar is significantly shaken up about this because if shed died like that she wouldnt have been Maledicted first Also Pilar needs to throw somebody a larger party preferably a surprise party single pieces of cake being handed out on special occasions arent going to cut it for her indefinitely This is mostly Maillols problem but is being copied to Sevar in case it somehow interacts with project matters or for that matter in case she wants to advise Maillol that having a Chaotic Good oracle to exhibit to Keltham isnt worth that much

Cayden Cailean is like the kind of god Carissa would have made up if she were a propagandist trying to convince Chelish people that Good is stunningly worthless and stupid Probably its fine if Pilar throws some parties how expensive can that even be though the only acceptable targets for surprise parties are the other girls and maybe whoevers on staff doing laundry or whatever Coordination with the library in Ostenso seems straightforwardly good for the cause of passing Keltham only desired books worth a mirror If Tonia and Meritxell are the chattiest girls they should both get some training screening for how to handle it if Keltham wants to fuck them

Carissa heads back over once shes had enough to eat 

There is no longer any staff on the premises doing laundry All the usual slaves have been removed for now theyd be infosec hazards to Keltham in any case Cooking janitorial and other ops are being performed by a few first circle priests of Asmodeus with appropriate civilian proficiencies

Maillol is afraid that anyone here without a claimed soul is going to get oracled

Hi again Carissa Im about to start winding down my workday but before I switch to nonwork mode I should try my cleric spells

Could just do it with Security if you didnt want to be there

Im in But a touch reluctant mildly traumatized by what happened yesterday so hopefully he wont think anything of the rest of the girls being somewhere far away where their anxieties and desires cannot be detected

Carissa may still be a little undercalibrated on how much Keltham can sight read Chelish expressions he cant see anything meant to be subtle

To a secure workroom then

First up is a first circle Abjuration

Protection from Evil but theyve already strategically modified the relevant sources It creates a defensive magical barrier and makes it impossible for summoned creatures to come into contact with you Its commonly used at the Worldwound as a cheap shield

Thats not easy to understand if its either a message or an actual contingency Things shouldnt be summonable inside the Forbiddance right Or is somebody going to come in with an army of summoned creatures from the outside

Correct Security confirms 

Could mean uh your protections still arent adequate Or that theres a summoned entity already here 

Actually Third circle unidentified conjuration thats the thing that does summoning Maybe its meant to be used before I use that How long does Protection last and can somebody tap me with a new one if this one runs out

Yes though also if its a summoning youre going to have to leave the Forbiddance to do it

Lasts two minutes per caster circle

Any way to tell by looking at the spell structure if somebody wants to show me an illusion of something

Security shows the spell structure for Planar Inquiry and then for Summon Monster III and then for Infernal Challenger

Summon Monster III Okay I dont get it what is that and why do I have it Unless the message is simply leave the Forbiddance

It summons an extraplanar creature You can get a minor outsider with it or an animal If you want to use it well have to leave the Forbiddance but that could probably be done safely if its done briefly and not telegraphed in advance so probably now if you want to do it

Literally right now If so start walking and Ill follow while I ask my additional questions

By not telegraphed in advance you mean we have to leave right now before any intelligence leak could tell an adversary to prepare an assault

This room is very shielded but I would want to depart it intending to head straight there To be clear we have no reason to believe this facility is being observed by any adversary But your gods communications are consistent with there being some threat and with sufficiently powerful magic it would be possible to surpass our precautions Or there could be a spy

 huh I wish I had a much better idea of exactly how well my god can see my situation and exactly how intricately predictive their plans are likely to be

Lets run through the other spells first and then you can tap me with another Protection and we can run outside and cast that one

Next up is an unfamiliar second circle divination the one that doesnt go by touch hes planning to save the Early Judgment for last or now second to last in case a vision of his or his gods afterlife ends up being awful news of some kind

Augury Gives advice from your god about whether a course of action like should I step outside the Forbiddance I guess will have immediately good or bad effects Was an incredibly powerful spell when prophecy wasnt broken and now it can only go off information thats already observable just not to you so its fine for like warning you of ambushes but lousy for anything more complicated Even for ambushes it now has a depressingly high false positive and false negative rate I want to say one in four readings is just nonsensical and not from your god at all

It doesnt quite make sense that his god would give him two Auguries only to have one of them tell him not to go outside but Keltham can sense that he needs to supply this question basically like now so he says out loud Effect of going outside the Forbiddance

Probably hes got two so that he can actually think of the correct question on 2

The god of knowledge would prefer that this Augury fail thank you very much

I think it failed entirely actually Or at least I didnt get any information off it Possibly waiting that long to ask the question didnt help Keltham had two Auguries but its not obvious he should tell them that

Next Unfamiliar third circle divination theres two of them that look pretty similar

Abadar is incredibly fucking done with everyone messing with his cleric Does Abadar go tax the temple of Nethys in Sothis into ruin because he likes money no

The thing about Augury is that its such a noisy broken channel now with prophecy broken no message can get through with Nethys opposing it

But He can be MAD ABOUT IT 

This spell gives him a sense of Carissa and Security and a sense that there arent other minds in the room and a sense he can see a new angle of them 

Detect Desires considered kind of invasive for what its worth and spellcasters will automatically try to fight it off though Im trying to not because were trying to build trust here 

My god gave me a nonconsensual mindreading spell Carissa He almost tells her to fight it off for Civilizations sake 

 but this could be about building trust if his god knows that he knows that they werent expecting it 

 you can let me read your desires if youre okay with it Carissa I dont see your job as requiring this Security neither

Its not exactly mind reading and I dont mind The spell says that Carissa wants to be like Contessa Lrilatha and wants to be a powerful wizard and wants to invent the Lawful Evil version of dath ilani teachings and bring them to every child in Cheliax and get rich and famous for it

Security wants to get out of this whole mess alive or at least with all his possessions restored post Resurrection and to meet his new daughter

They picked which Security very strategically

Thats not absolute evidence but its evidence if they dont have easy ways to fake that too He wishes it hadnt been obtained at that kind of cost I have another third circle divination which looked a lot like that one though not identical You 

 I cant say its not important but Civilization would correctly kick me out if I pressured you into this

Carissa appreciates having had all day to think about what to say to him Keltham in a way its a gift right I want you to feel safer trusting me I want you to have a real reason to

He casts the spell now and without further quibbling because it means less the more time they have to prepare and if hes going to do it he may as well get as much trust from it as he can

Carissa is scared of being turned into a statue and buried deep beneath the ground so she never gets an afterlife until the stone wears away after millions of years and maybe the universe is destroyed before then Thats it thats the only thing 

Security is scared of fucking this up and dying getting Keltham killed getting fired and then having the kids think hes a loser

I saw Keltham says and dismisses the spells continuation with an almost violent act of will more than a simple absence of concentration Its off

Thank you

He can think of things to say to Carissa about what shes afraid of but but later and only if she doesnt tell him to forget he ever saw it

Fourth circle abjuration he says instead Ready Keltham sort of wants this over

Go

Cast

 dont recognize it but lasts two hours per caster circle protective against enchantments might also do something else

 is somebody going to try to enchant me when I go outside the Forbiddance Then why would my god suggest that I go outside in the first place 

Well obviously his god could be trying to protect him against internal adversary enchantments too from somebody who wasnt Carissa and probably not this security guard either

 Or his god could be telling him to go outside and spring a trap on purpose instead of waiting for it to go off

Keltham really wishes he had a much better sense of what was normal for Golarion

Next up unfamiliar second circle divination with touch target I am going to tap myself with it be prepared to hit me with a dispel if I yell or fall over

Ready says Security

Spellboop

A city by the standards of Kelthams world not even a particularly tall one but a beautiful one with rising golden spires and rooftop parks and flying gondolae and people on their busy way through shining streets about half of them human and many of those who arent things much stranger 

Its Im seeing into a different high tech planet one that isnt dath ilan definite magitech not just tech wide variety of aliens I wish I had some way of showing them to you 

And then Keltham runs out of ability to speak Theres an almost painful wrenching at his heart a sudden manifestation of the reverence and faith that a dath ilani feels when watching a personnel launch to the Moon base but stronger than Keltham has ever felt it this is the dream what Civilization wants to be when it grows up only something beyond that something that only appears in science fiction movies because dath ilan knows with high probability that they wont run into any aliens for another half to two billion years But if that wasnt true if somehow it wasnt true and the explanation for why the aliens hadnt already appeared wasnt anything bad if somehow the aliens werent already as unimaginably advanced as dath ilan will be in another hundred million years but only equals then this would be that place the dream a symbol that cant exist of dozens of species existing together in peace

And commerce

He doesnt know how he knows that the flying gondolae were bought and not just given away but he knows it Its not because they couldnt make enough to give away but because people doing things to benefit one another and be benefited in return is something holy in itself to them

It lasts a very long very short time and then it ends

Hes crying Not really much of a surprise there Not what his gendertrope says to do in front of Carissa except in private but drop table gendertropes

What spell was that Keltham says when it stops feeling improper to speak He thinks he knows obviously but he wants to hear them say it

Early Judgment Shows the afterlife youd go to if you died now

Do afterlives here are they known to draw from many planets many planes with different sapient lifeforms Hes trying not to jump too fast to the obvious conclusion that his god isnt from around here any more than Keltham himself is

They planned this out too but thats not the question they were expecting They draw from the other Golarion sapients but not from other places that Ive ever heard of 

Right Nonhumans here too Hell try describing one of the aliens he saw maybe Hell remember that one that was a pretty striking one Ill see if I can manage to learn Silent Image tomorrow thats probably my top priority first circle wizard spell and show you one of the aliens to see if its already known He wouldnt guess it to be known but it sure is the sort of situation where he can be wrong

Carissa very dearly wishes she could read his mind right now Yeah sounds good Tomorrow is that all your spells

Ive got two of the Early Judgment maybe it would give me a glimpse of somebody elses afterlife if thats okay again I realize thats a pretty personal thing 

Not how the spell works thankfully it only shows the subject Go ahead though actually I think that it might just show the person touched But you could try

All right then Obviously volunteers only so any volunteers

Ooh Pick me I mean I volunteer

Time for everyone to roll their Will save to realize that theres no reason for Pilar to be there Pilar has four oracle levels three wizard levels and 

Never mind Cayden Cailean seems to be expending energy on this particular occasion Everybody including Pilar herself fails their Will save

You sure

Its something shes been worried about ever since she got oracled so it would make perfect sense that if Keltham called for volunteers for this party game for this test shed volunteer for it Right Right Everything is fine

Yes Pilar says sounding very assured about it

On the off chance Keltham sees anything from the spell better for him to see Elysium she doesnt remember making that decision but it does make sense

Spellboop on Pilar

Pilar draws a sharp breath and then doesnt seem to breathe at all for half a minute

Keltham isnt getting anything himself and people in Cheliax sure do control their facial expressions hard he would not have been difficult to read while he was seeing wherever that was

It ends

Im done she says a short time later

All right if he didnt get any glimpse of her Early Judgment himself then theres not any trust to be gained from questioning her and she obviously doesnt want to talk about it Though if it was just Hell thered be no reason for her to never mind figure out her characters route later

Okay so now I think we should probably all go directly outside the Forbiddance If youre okay with that Pilar I think that opsec says youre not supposed to run off while we do that

With some effort Pilar refocuses on ongoing events She has no idea what Keltham is talking about but shes obviously supposed to know and Security isnt acting like its a bad idea so clearly shes supposed to play along Of course she says in an Asmodean fake perky cheerful voice

Lead on then Keltham says to Security Reminder boop me with Protection first in case there was a reason for that

Protection not From Evil if theres trouble it probably wont be Evil trouble from Good Also Invisibility all around 

And then off they go

Well its not like Keltham knows exactly where the edge of the Forbiddance is hes just along for this ride Hell go where taken

They go out of the villa into the immediately surrounding forest after a short while Security pauses and casts a barrage of detection spells 

All right if you stand here the summons should work he says If I were you Id try to summon an archon Lawful Good or an azata Chaotic Good and ask what their disagreements with Cheliax are but I havent actually the slightest guess what your god is aiming at here and if you have any guesses then you should go with those

That makes sense and doesnt look on the surface like trapped advice but if the spell can take this input Keltham would like in preference order whatever his god wants to send him some entity that works for his god and that can answer questions or an archon

Cast

He gets an archon Its a glowing sphere of light apparently

Archon gets Silenced and enclosed in an auditory and visual hallucination

Hello Ooooh this place is pretty What can I help you with

Its not that unpretty itself He probably shouldnt say anything that gives away his own special status if this is something not favorable to him as well as Hell and that potentially goes back to wherever it came from afterwards Also it doesnt look like he has long on this spell so hed better be brief Do Asmodeuss representatives tend to negotiate fairly and honestly and keep their commitments What do you most dislike about Asmodeus and or Cheliax

Asmodeuss representatives are Lawful and keep their commitments and negotiate honestly I dislike their efforts to build a society where everyone is Lawful Evil and goes to Hell because it is better for everyone to live in a society in which most people are Good Asmodeus makes decisions based on what Asmodeus wants rather than whats best for all sentients and while Asmodeus mostly wants desirable things like prosperity and invention and peace Good often believes his decisions wrong from a perspective concerned with everybody For example He doesnt care enough about shutting down Abaddon or stopping Zon Kuthon

Carissas proposed phrasings She thinks theyll land but she feels nervous hearing them actually said aloud

Nethyss options for conveying information to human beings are limited His use of standard divine channels will drive the message recipient irrevocably insane even in the afterlife however light the touch

But there was a purpose of oracles of old They cannot receive arbitrary messages from gods They can receive presentiments under negotiated conditions meant to ensure that those presentiments help to bring about Prophecy rather than avert it

Prophecy is shattered now which is to say depending on how you look at it 

 Nethys now knows more than anyone else about how the future is otherwise destined to go so if anybody was supposed to still go around sending presentiments to oracles it would be His job wouldnt it

Nethys does have any options for conveying information to humans Theyre just difficult and expensive and not the sort of thing that parts of Nethys can do on a whim there has to be more power and unity behind it than Nethys usually tries to muster Difficult expensive painful Its rare for that much of Nethys to agree on anything

A number of girls are now back in the library studying Taldorian history and customs again which seems more urgent even than reviewing their math

Hopefully this concentration of individuals is enough to warrant an invisible Security presence because things are about to go badly for Cheliax if not

Ione sees a brief and terrible flash of a man with skeletal forearms and white eyes a Presence of Evil and Magic so strong that she can taste His name Takaral like a dead and slimy worm in her mouth and she knows that this is one of the Heralds of Nethys that Nethys long ago empowered with scraps of His sanity and will and knows also that 

INCOMING FROM NIDAL CALL REINFORCEMENTS CAST RESISTANCE AGAINST NEGATIVE ENERGY INCOMING INCOMING INCOMING

Ione Sala will then slump over with blood starting to trickle from her nose

Otolmens is now COMPLETELY FED UP with the THIRD direct divine intervention in MINUTES She has had ENOUGH of these SHENANIGANS

For a very exact and particular sense of fed up which would be very predictable if you knew enough about Her a series of cumulative provocations with little time to decay putting Her over a threshold

She cant do this very often without re authorization that Pharasma may never get around to giving Her at this rate but 

IN PHARASMAS NAME I REQUIRE ALL GODS TO STOP ALL UNAUTHORIZED DIVINE INTERVENTIONS WITHIN OR CAUSALLY AIMED AT THE FOLLOWING REGION 

Rapidly His intentions clearly legible as friendly and Otolmens goal promoting because He knows what Otolmens has trouble sometimes realizing on Her own Otolmens if you tell them exactly where to look things may become even more complicated center it on Ostenso that will also include the critical region without giving them too much info

ONE HUNDRED DISTANCE UNITS AROUND ltcoordinates for the top of the tallest tower in Ostensogt

Acknowledged send almost all the gods in Golarion and then most of them start paging Abadar asking if He knows why Otolmens is this upset and if they should also be concerned

There is one god who is an exception to that as He is an exception to many other arrangements among gods

Fuck you Ill do what you dont want

Theres more to it than that of course Zon Kuthon is not that easy to manipulate Zon Kuthon was somewhat on the fence about Nethyss strange request and stranger warning He doesnt do what other gods want of Him usually but Nethys went more legible than was usual for Nethys and seemed to show knowledge about how the mortal who admittedly looks rather strange was likely to oppose Zon Kuthons own purposes and have the power to do that for some reason That the mortal is in Cheliax is also not a good sign Asmodeus is foremost among the gods who would actually choose to annihilate Zon Kuthon and not just dislike Him Zon Kuthon ordered a strike team assembled targeted held ready but has not given them the go sign

Zon Kuthon is likewise aware that Otolmens is as wary of Him as of any god save Nethys Dou Bral once fought to seal Rovagug Even if the expected balance of pain and pleasure and things that Zon Kuthon now cares about changed when Dou Bral Himself changed to Zon Kuthon and changed His expected effects on the world one would expect Zon Kuthon to be a lot closer to unleashing Rovagug than most other gods

The latest attempt at Otolmens telling Zon Kuthon what not to do is sufficient to swing His decision especially given that Zon Kuthon does not expect to be caught

He orders the recipient of His vision to tell the team to attack immediately and then to kill himself without mentioning to anyone else that this was a fresh divine intervention rather than a previously given order Theres a closing opportunity window here since if the strike team arrives fast enough the belief of other gods should be that it was already in motion when the edict was laid Its very unlikely anyone will see Him about it any god trying to pay that much attention to all of Nidal would fragment themselves and drive themselves irrevocably mad

Gorum Chaotic Neutral god of battle god of strength and weapons and soldiers receives a message from a certain Someone who He is rather fonder of than She is of Gorum This is only to be expected given that Her workings often conduce to His purposes His workings to Hers not so much

She offers Him information under the condition that She wishes it not revealed to other gods that She was the source of that information

Gorum accepts He does not expect to be harmed by the mere reception of information however suspicious He could always choose to ignore it and do nothing with it

Zon Kuthon is about to violate Otolmenss order in Pharasmas Name If you look exactly here you should be able to catch Him at it

Interesting Yes there it is What of it Zon Kuthon is not as opposed to My purpose as to those of others

Zon Kuthon has not much margin in His tolerance of the expected future state of Golarion If nothing else is done about it He is likely to attempt to release Rovagug during an upcoming major disruption to the world

As much as You might have wished to use Zon Kuthon as a counterbalance to Asmodeus and have been among the foremost proponents of that events have now been set in motion such that it is no longer safe to try to use Zon Kuthon for that purpose He cannot be allowed to remain as He is now

Part of the goddess speaking to Him goes legible She is being truthful though it is also clear that She is withholding much for She does not likewise make legible that She is sharing all relevant information

Some of the shape of the connivance is becoming clear to Him Would this upcoming major disruption be any of Your own work perhaps

Perhaps If it were I would wish to conceal My hand and show it to few other gods with this exception made to reduce the probability of a foreseeable outcome where the world ends up destroyed

Gorum knows Hes being used of course but it does not offend Him as it might offend other gods a soldier is a soldier whether they die for anothers profit or their own There is only one question He asks Will there be battle and bloodshed

Deaths shall come faster than Golarion has seen in an age

Gorum will go along with this then

Passcode to reenter the Forbiddance is erecura Security suddenly whispers to Keltham Say it and run

And then things start happening very quickly

Fights among high level casters in Golarion dont last long Most spells are deadly and if one side or the other has reason not to use deadly force there are plenty of decisive ways to end a fight with the other person living but say transformed into a hamster or Plane Shifted or turned to stone An outnumbered wizard might have time to get a single spell off or to empty the contents of their Bag of Holding onto the battlefield or if theyre well trained to empty the contents of their Bag of Holding onto the battlefield while getting a single spell off and then its pretty much over if they didnt pick that spell well

He doesnt understand but has ever been through an Alien Invasion Rehearsal Festival so erecura and turn to run towards the villa 

Sudden Nidal strike team Theyre mostly flooding in towards the villa accompanied by a horde of undead shadows but with other teams placed to guard the villas circumference

They spot Keltham and the others

They can move a lot faster than Keltham can run Anybody who can keep that much track of tactical information happening that quickly may note that they seem to be interested in Keltham specifically rather than Security or either of the two women

One of them casts a spell from a scroll targeted at Keltham Enchantment compulsion

Ideally one counterspells that but Security is busy casting Haste and flinging an arc of beads of Fireball out across the whole perimeter and drinking a potion of Greater Invisibility and communicating Kelthams position to the rest of Security and communicating clear places for arriving reinforcements on the edge of the Forbiddance 

Ideally one counterspells that but Carissa because she is an idiot assumed that Abadar was mad at Cheliax and that the stuff about Zon Kuthon was a lie and the spells she prepared today are for Kelthams pretend escape well she can Fly and if necessary attempt to drag him into the villa against his enchanted will 

That might have gone a lot more poorly for Keltham if he didnt have an Enchantment Foil and a Protection From Good as it happens but it still counts

Keltham now knows that somebody tried to use mind control on him He could very easily pretend to play along with it if he wants let it look exactly like the enchantment is controlling him but that doesnt actually seem smart because the compulsion is telling him to freeze in place

Somebodys now in front of Keltham and about to stick an incredibly deadly looking magical sword in him Are Security or Carissa in position to do anything about that

How the fuck are they but of course theyre Lawful Evil and the Forbiddance deters them not at all and they wouldve teleported already combat enhanced 

Carissa is flying over there but not particularly in the expectation that she is faster than that sword 

Security is dead which is generally what happens when youre hanging out alone throwing enormous handfuls of Fireballs at an oncoming army

Up to her then

Obedience and serving Asmodeuss best interests comes naturally to her Pilar doesnt actually think about the consequences before she throws herself in front of the sword

Once the sword is in her she has time to think very briefly that its not what she wanted she cant even be Maledicted but Elysium didnt look that bad after all there are people wholl hurt you there even if they dont mean it

Then she dies

Keltham saw it in only a fragment doesnt turn his head to watch the rest because that would be stupid that wont stop them hes going to die temporarily like she did is there anything he can do 

He only remembers then just then too late that he is supposed to have magic now

He casts Sanctuary

Random Kuthite assault team members can sometimes make their Will save against a fourth circle cleric but not necessarily on their first try It also takes a moment to realize why you suddenly arent choosing to cut down the target whos right in front of you

Keltham will live for at least another six seconds

By then Carissa will be there Spells are nice but the best way to kill someone when youre flying is to drop rocks on their head She doesnt have rocks but she can cancel the Fly which is sort of the same thing 

Youd think that dropping out of the sky on someone would hurt you as badly as them which is not a good tradeoff when youre outnumbered but 1 its possible for even a random civilian to survive a fall from 60 feet if they let their legs break the fall whereas its less possible to survive the same force landing on your skull and 2 she has a healing spell almost finished as she lands which means shes back on her feet faster which means shortly after that it doesnt matter if the original injuries wouldve been fatal or not because Carissa can pull the sword out of Pilars chest and stab him until they definitely are 

Cheliax has reinforcements teleporting in by now outside the Forbiddance There are enough spells flying that all you can see are streaks of light and all you can hear are explosions and occasional screams 

Does this dead guy have like a dagger in addition to the ridiculous ornamental sword Carissa super does not have the strength to wield the sword effectively

No and also theres now an additional three Kuthites who unfortunately look more interested in killing Keltham than in killing her

When your situation is that your wizard is in a hand to hand swordfight with three actual fighters your situation is very bad Carissa can do a Minor Illusion that she has backup de invisibling themselves but thats about all shes got

It gets the three Kuthites to pause for a couple of seconds before one of them snarls something and they turn their attention back to Keltham

Well on the bright side the Queen of Cheliax will have no opportunity to deny Carissa Hell 

She gets in the way

Before Carissa can actually get herself into the way it becomes a moot point

Reinforcements now include that elderly and long serving retainer to the House of Thrune Gorthoklek general of Cheliaxs armies and more importantly at the moment a pit fiend With relatively few exceptions across Golarion the general rule is that the pit fiend wins

He lands on top of the Kuthites about to attack Keltham without that significantly slowing his massive clawed feet from striking the ground Stay near me he speaks in low rumbling Baseline words that Carissa can probably recognize by now as dath ilani in intonation even if she doesnt know the meaning Then Gorthoklek begins speaking spellwords and from him spring scorching rays quickened fireballs a meteor swarm

One claw makes a beckoning gesture to Carissa

She will come when beckoned and confirm for Keltham hes on our side though presumably hes inferred that from how hes breathing

Yeah thats assuming way too much about Kelthams priors being strong enough to relate his evidence in any solid way to reality

Orders else he starts in Baseline per emergency training and then switches to Taldane Orders or situation report

The Chelish norms for emergency communications are different enough shes not quite sure what he means Gorthoklek serves the Queen stay close and shout at him if somethings after you

If youre not otherwise busy whats currently happening and are we likely to win it

Zon Kuthon attacked us and yes

There was supposedly only a 4 probability of that happening this quickly even after updating on his gods warning Keltham doesnt know if the read here is that his god understood which exact leap of wild guessing hed make or if Cheliax is dumb enough to fake the attack he indicated being nervous about in the most blatant way possible He cant trust his truthspell now that he knows what Fake Being Enchanted actually does he knows exactly how easy it would be for a fourth circle cleric to defeat and they didnt mention that to him even if Carissa said honestly that she didnt recognize the spell 

Pilars dead Is that permanent when somebody does it using a horrible looking sharp thing

 the sword isnt an elaborate sword of soul trapping or something is it No perfectly normal 3 vicious cruel sword Not permanent though if were at war with Nidal now they might be prioritizing resurrecting soldiers

Dead for a while is not an emergency dead forever is Keltham remembers Carissas own fears fast enough not to say it

He looks upward then Strange auroras are flickering in the twilight sky visible even without full night fallen

The phenomenon doesnt look centered on the villa

It looks like its stretched all the way from horizon to horizon

Whats happening to the sky says Keltham

 I have no idea

Gorthokleks voice answers instead He is no longer casting fire about him battle is dying away and now Gorthoklek himself seems to be looking up at the sky

His rumbling voice sends chills down the spine of all who hear it Keltham and Carissa alike

Those above all mortals now battle

An observation 

If Zon Kuthon were to have just violated a Pharasmas Name edict about nonintervention that would rather settle the question of whether it is safe for Golarion for Zon Kuthon to continue to exist If He is inverted such as to not just fail to coordinate with but to deliberately defy such edicts even only occasionally if theres even a chance thats what happened here 

One would expect Gorum to be first to speak on such occasions He is a very great god though not quite as great as Asmodeus and has always been the foremost proponent of keeping Zon Kuthon as a counterbalance Asmodeuss insinuation would be noted would shift some probability estimates a tiny bit shifting other negotiations a little bit in Asmodeuss favor but His suggestion would soon be rejected

Gorum doesnt speak for some reason

Irori knows fractionally more than other gods about this matter or so He believes and is not particularly a fan of Asmodeus

Hes not a fan of Zon Kuthon either

He is less yet in favor of unnecessary conflict between major deities

There have already been multiple divine interventions meddling in an issue of some concern to Otolmens She is understandably annoyed While I do not think we stand in danger of imminent destruction I would fully advise that everyone listen to Her about this and comply with the spirit as well as the letter of Her instructions and not meddle here any more

That said this same record of previous divine intervention and the timing suggests that Zon Kuthon probably already had His warriors on the way when Otolmens issued Pharasmas Edict and stands not in direct violation of it I doubt He had an army already assembled and waiting to be directed straight into Otolmenss interdicted region almost the moment she issued the Edict

There is discussion of this leaning of course towards Iroris viewpoint Actually disciplining Zon Kuthon in any serious way would be a lot of unpleasant work

Gorum speaks then after the fashion of gods

He shows them the evidence of Zon Kuthon in fact specifically instructing His people directly after Otolmenss order to violate Her edict in Pharasmas Name

Gorum has been persuaded

He is obviously not willing to go along with Zon Kuthons destruction that would give the portfolio of Lawful Evil to Asmodeus alone among the ancient gods with reverberant effects at the deepest levels of reality But let Zon Kuthon be sealed up away as much as Zon Kuthon can be sealed in a vault not unlike that which holds Rovagug to be released only as a counterweight to Asmodeus if that becomes necessary Asmodeus will be strengthened by this too of course and not trivially but that is a price Gorum would sooner pay than see Zon Kuthon release Rovagug

If such a thing is to be done and it does appear it might be necessary it should be done at once and unanimously because a day of war Golarion can withstand but a fight that would last any longer than that will flood the crops in the fields and destroy the people and down the line the kingdoms relying on them 

Iomedae has considered long ago how this could be done At the time it did not seem wise and She has been apprised little of whatever prompted so many gods to change their calculations but here is how it would be done if sufficient resources are committed to the doing

And if it is to be done She should hold the key obviously as a Lawful god opposed to Asmodeus lets be honest the Lawful god opposed to Asmodeus and one who can be predicted to release Him under conditions satisfactory to everyone else save Asmodeus whose awful conduct is of course the reason theyve even been pressed to this dilemma

Gorum would prefer to hold the key Himself of course but He realizes that other gods are more likely to go along with the suggestion that it be Iomedae

 there is clearly plotting going on here gods are not stupid Gorum did not come across this information by coincidence

That Nethys could have given it to Gorum is almost too obvious to need thinking but you cant go around blaming Nethys for everything thats a way to miss all the other possibilities that arent Nethys did it Also contributing information leading to the downfall of another god even Zon Kuthon would be pretty daring for Nethys other gods are aware that Nethys could do more than the usual damage if Nethys started acting deliberately against other gods and while Nethys might be able to get away with moving against Zon Kuthon out of all the gods once Hed be walking very thin ice after that if He were ever found out

A plot between Gorum and Asmodeus Some weird accommodation between them

Gods minds are large enough to explicitly consider many possible hypotheses They will consider the possibility that it was Somebody Else who made an accommodation with Asmodeus and then successfully persuaded Gorum to turn against Zon Kuthon using this information They will consider the possibility that Zon Kuthon was lured into doing this and that is why Gorum knew where to look to collect the evidence

It doesnt change the fact that Zon Kuthon did in fact deliberately violate a Pharasmas Name edict from Otolmens This is kind of a big deal for any god let alone Zon Kuthon who maliciously withdrew His powers from the Star Towers that Dou Bral used to impale and weaken Rovagug within Its prison

Asmodeus is confused and dislikes it 

Those are inadequate words for the experience of being Asmodeus words are generally inadequate for it but those ones especially so All of Caina grows colder as Asmodeus withdraws His power from Hell in order to think few ever enter or leave Nessus and there is no word of what is happening there

It obviously serves Him for Zon Kuthon to be warred with and locked away its why He bothered to vaguely insinuate this might be warranted And it does seem like Zon Kuthon might be more willing to war with Asmodeus not even for any clear reason than previously imagined which makes the case for being rid of Him stronger 

But this was orchestrated unambiguously maybe by Nethys maybe by several gods collaborating Iomedae and Irori Sarenrae and Abadar and Cayden Cailean who has been intervening in Cheliax for some not known reason A minor god gambling everything and it is hard to imagine that the end towards which it was orchestrated was simply the removal of Zon Kuthon 

Theres lots of minor things that could be attained in the short term by distracting Asmodeus with a war with Zon Kuthon Cheliax will be drawn into a war with Nidal Ground might be lost at the Worldwound Perhaps a difficult province in Cheliax could break free 

It seems unlikely that a god made a move with these stakes for that practically trivial prize 

Asmodeus is confused and dislikes it 

And yet when confused its better to have more resources than fewer and its better for Zon Kuthon to be gone 

He indicates willingness to back imprisonment of Zon Kuthon with more resources if the key goes to Gorum And Hed like Iomedae to note that absolutely none of the recent nonsense is his fault hes intervened only when fully paid by other gods to direct his people in not harming mortals They got suddenly attached to

Iomedae ignores this Shes not sure why Asmodeus bothers to talk to Her without paying Her to listen

At this point Abadar has no idea what is going on lit plenty of hypotheses and little evidence but He wants Zon Kuthon sealed up rather a lot Abadar is the one who long ago bargained for Zon Kuthon to go into a temporary imprisonment that should have lasted much longer than it did

Asmodeus benefits greatly from this more than any of the rest of us I suggest that we designate this threshold level of resource commitment as Asmodeuss fair contribution and probabilistically collectively withdraw our support in proportion to how He tries to contribute any less

There is debate but quickly somebody might tip off Zon Kuthon and then it all becomes harder

Most gods not all combine their powers the rest agree at least not to interfere

The forging of a vault begins with a key that Iomedae alone can turn

Sarenrae temporarily focuses nearly all Her will on the vault where Rovagug is imprisoned she could not protect that vault from a full assault by Zon Kuthon from every direction but with Zon Kuthon otherwise distracted she will be able to fend off any lesser attempts at that if it does not come as a surprise There also does Otolmens stand guard

And most of the other gods of Golarion assault Zon Kuthon everywhere that is not that vault Zon Kuthon must put the greater parts of Himself within it or else be vastly diminished

That Zon Kuthon will scatter smaller sized fragments of His will and power beyond the vault yet linked to His greater whole is inevitable it is not easy to really really kill a god if they have not made themselves vulnerable by collecting themselves too much into one place

A few minutes after Gorthokleks arrival there is no one else moving in the wreckage around the villa Cheliax is teleporting most of its emergency response teams out There are some people walking through the grounds identifying bodies disabling trap spells and unexploded fireballs from a distance with Unseen Servants 

Carissa has forced herself to stop looking at the unnerving lights If Asmodeus has decided to kill Zon Kuthon then good thats very reasonable of Him nothing to it 

Keltham has so many Additional Questions that dont seem like the right time to pester somebody with an endless list of

What now

Theres still at least one emergency response squad nearby

I am needed elsewhere rumbles Gorthoklek He addresses the emergency response squad telepathically You Obey her A claw indicates the Asmodean in question

Gorthoklek then launches himself into the air beating his vast black wings in a way that is blatantly insufficient to actually support his weight in any way whatsoever to the eyes of anyone who has even heard of aerodynamics When he has risen above the Forbiddance he teleports out

Carissa watches him go which is a mistake because now shes looking at the lights again Is there an area of the villa thats been cleared

The leader of the squad sends a message receives a reply Theyve had very little briefing before the assault other than dont tip off the guy wearing weird clothes that Cheliax is Evil which like hes just seen a pit fiend but orders are orders That Gorthoklek addressed them telepathically may imply that he didnt mean weird clothes man to know that Carissa is obeying them

We are fairly sure that one wing was unbreached The other option is to begin clearing an area of the imperial palace for visitors Were awaiting clarification on that Namely hers apparently

Shes in an evening dress befitting a countesss heir which is covered with blood in a manner also befitting a countesss heir and her sword is incredibly expensive She looks tiredly at Keltham Confirm youre uninjured as far as you know not affected by any mind altering magic

His foot sort of hurts now that he thinks about it Maybe some sort of slightly twisted ankle A very light push a channeling of energy and the feeling vanishes Uninjured now No compulsions the blocking spell was effective If for some reason it helps at all to have him say that

Oh so now hell know exactly what Enchantment Foil does The fourth circle one We should get someone more senior to identify it for you Im still pretty sure it does something besides that but maybe your god gave it to you for that If its all right with whoevers in charge she says to the emergency response team I think wed like to go to the secured wing here so we can talk privately

Security made its stand protecting the library and all the girls who could get to it in time for lack of anything particularly better to protect once they realized Keltham wasnt on the premises might as well try to save Cheliax the cost of a few Raise Dead spells that Keltham would probably insist upon The surviving rooms are full of response team but they could clear out one of the two rooms of the library without much trouble this does imply going through the library first

Asmodia was in her bedroom and got swarmed by shadows after which some summoned monster or another gnawed off all of her legs below her mid thighs after Asmodias body got retrieved it was dumped in one corner of the library for use in later Resurrection or Raise Dead Regenerate A dead Security wizards body has been dropped beside her

Ione is unconscious and would ordinarily have been evacced but library oracle if shes got to be in some library thats not a triage center it might as well be this library Iones body is occupying the largest best padded chair in the library arranged with some detectable amount of respect hands folded in her lap like a noblewoman Things could have gone much worse without that brief warning to put up buffs and ready items If Nidal had been able to lock down communications before they could call for reinforcements or get assassins past the wards without triggering them it could have been much much worse

The other girls are reading some of them Paxti is talking too fast to somebody whos tolerating that one of them is examining a spiky dagger with a gem studded hilt not in the manner of somebody who expects to keep it but somebody who wants to take a good look at it before Security takes it away

Keltham catches sight of Asmodias body and after the first horrible gruesome shock is past theres an odd sense of reassurance They wouldnt treat her body like that if death was going to be more than an inconvenience to her right Iones body is actually more unnerving if you think of it that way but maybe shes just unconscious and thats why shes carefully arranged Or can they not resurrect her if shes not really a worshipper of Is Ione okay

Alive Got a vision warning us right before Shrug People often make full recoveries from having been contacted directly by a god

 any god but Nethys Any god but Nethys It could still have been some other god besides Nethys And if it was Nethys there is nothing Keltham can do about it except raise up science and engineering in this world to a point where it can reprogram damaged souls even if that takes a while 

Is all of this real Is this a LARP It doesnt make sense to hear about the one god who can destroy mind states and then Ione just happens to get touched by that one Nethys is supposed to not do that anymore

Can you tell if her minds okay Did we temporarily lose anyone else Besides Pilar

Quick messaged updates to Sevar from surviving Security Maillols temporarily dead and obviously top priority since Maillol himself could cast Raise Dead Elias Abarco is temporarily dead Ione Sala did in fact shout out warning of a Nidal attack moments before it happened there isnt anybody left who could plausibly give orders overriding Sevars

Wow Okay Minimal lies to Keltham stands this is she thinks good for the project on the whole it will make Keltham seriously reconsider departing She imagines they might now be at war with Nidal in which case resurrections will be in short supply Probably Keltham should be informed theyre at war with Nidal even if for some reason thats not happening it allows for a lot of flex in supplies and resources for the next couple of months 

Her Intelligence shows up normal to the spell for checking that Weve been advised not to try to rouse her just to heal her periodically and let her rest None of your other girls are dead most project staff are dead

Keltham thinks of something he shouldve remembered earlier I have healing powers left for the day not sure how much is that helpful right now Carissa are you injured

Im injured and have already had enough healing to keep me on my feet

Security calls heal and persons still injured gather around Keltham within his channel distance expectantly 

Keltham is expecting a queue of people to be tapped but once they explain to him that he can channel a burst of positive energy hell do that at everyone in his insanely huge healing radius 4d6 hit points apiece 30 foot radius

 wow Keltham had no idea fourth circle clerics were that kind of good news

I think I can do that again at least once and possibly more Keltham says still feeling a bit stunned

We could use one more a surviving Security says The girls cannot 4d6 is enough that the healing magic is running across the surface of their skin patching up papercuts

He does it again

 he is beginning to understand from this from the vision in the Early Judgment that being a cleric is not entirely about it isnt only he doesnt have the words for it

Still have at least one repeat left he says

 shouldnt he be doing this every evening to people packed into appropriately dense arrays around him Or maybe Cheliax is saturated on healing already at most other times if other clerics can also do this sort of thing

His brain has some brief weird internal fight about the obvious thought that if healing is expensive he should do it and if its cheap he shouldnt but common sense wins there

Ill ask if anyone else needs it says whoevers apparently appointed himself Security spokesperson and he trots outside to do that and to inform the injured that the friendly LN cleric is not allowed to know Cheliax is evil

So says Meritxell whos angling for Duchess of Nidal Shes looking at Carissa though she doesnt quite dare to say it to Carissa with Keltham right here having no reason to think Carissas in the running for any duchies 

Sounds like a miserable job says Carissa curtly though of course shed take it She is concerned that Keltham seems to be having a religious experience about healing that seems very much not ideal

Theres no free chairs Keltham will sit down on the ground breathe to recover and try to figure out everything he just did wrong Was he supposed to use the Owls Wisdom Could he have seen this all coming if hed used the Owls Wisdom on himself at the right time Why put Keltham right outside the Forbiddance when this all happened How is anything being predicted that finely even by gods quantum indexical uncertainty doesnt let ideal agents pull that kind of shit isnt prophecy supposed to be broken around here Possible answer that was an event triggered whenever Keltham went outside the Forbiddance but then then 

Keltham really doesnt get it

Carissa sits down next to him

The other room of the librarys clear and free If you want to go rest somewhere

He is he in more trouble than others whod pay more for that room if it were priced Plausibly yes he is from a Civilization with no Worldwound and was squarely caught in the middle of things Also if Carissa thinks he should maybe he should

Make sure they know where to poke the healer

Keltham pushes himself to his feet and goes with Carissa to the librarys other room

How to do this without being pushy in a way that he wont be into or without seeming like she needs comfort she finds a sufficiently large chair and sinks down into it next to him and puts her arm around him and rests her head on his shoulder 

I dont understand much about what happened or what we were supposed to do she says after a moment But this is a pretty good outcome from the space of possible outcomes of a force of that size trying to take you And well get the dead back assuming they want to come back

Probability that Asmodia and Pilar want to come back

To life Uh ninety percent theyre young and theyre wizards and I dont know either of them to have been really excited for an afterlife or anything To the project maybe lower than that Which allows for not raising them if it seems not worth it on reflection though Carissa is very reluctant to authorize a lie that big and that total which isnt utterly necessary 

19 on one of them not coming back is an awful lot of probability mass on hes thinking about this the wrong way theyre in another continent where one of them might choose to stay thats all He just needs to see one of them come back and hell believe it

Did my god Set me up Not to die obviously but to trigger at that time 

What just happened which parts of this could a god predict and choose

I have no idea They shouldnt have been able to with prophecy gone they couldve been able to see that Zon Kuthon was planning something and maybe seen that you were going to attempt to leave and that when you did youd die or be captured if you were intending that especially if you were intending it in prayer Otherwise I dont think they couldve operated even at that level of knowledge before prophecy you could have things like they thought it was better if you were outside for the attack but not since prophecy broke If they knew itd be because Zon Kuthon was amassing his forces and They could see that

Keltham is tempted at this point to poop out all this shit and tap himself with the Owls Wisdom and to hell with personality integrity shit just got visibly really serious instead of quietly really serious He doesnt consider the thought for very long the time to tap himself with Owls Wisdom if he hadnt been an idiot was either the moment when the crisis started or sometime before then If its not an emergency you dont take mind altering performance drugs in the kind of state that Keltham is in right now

Were the two Auguries meant to indicate that this particular Augury was really important thats plausibly thats plausibly it if hed cast the second Augury then and got a result of massive disaster from heading outside the Forbiddance that wouldve maybe that was what was meant to happen but how was Keltham supposed to know hed thought it was one spell to figure out what the spell was and then the second one when hed had time to think of a question 

Not his fault plausibly in a way that makes sense to blame himself for theres no obvious actually general heuristic to update here that isnt just use both Auguries on the first question to enter your mind Kelthams god might not have been able to exactly predict 

I got two Auguries I thought the first one was to find out what the spell was and the second one was for when Id had time to think of the right question If my god thought that three quarters the first Augury wouldnt fail but if it did fail I would use the second one or if people just always get two Auguries for redundancy then maybe we werent supposed to go outside we were supposed to get a result showing disaster if we went outside and that would have tipped us off without us going outside If thats true then my god is not a perfect predictor theyre not looking into the future theyre working off a fallible model In that case they wouldnt have been able to do exact timing and that attack was set to go off the moment I went outside not because my god predicted the timing that precisely

Similarly when it comes to Zon Kuthon our two obvious hypotheses are one attack was building since yesterday god warned us of it yesterday Two that spell was a warning of something else I misinterpreted it as Zon Kuthon and somehow that triggered the attack by Zon Kuthon like by my thinking of him loudly enough that he heard it like a prayer which does not seem particularly plausible to me but Im saying it out loud anyways because Golarion

Or of course somebody in Governance heard him say it and thought it would be a great thing to fake without the slightest use of subtlety The light shows overhead could have been locally faked to look global Maybe Ione can grab a newspaper from Ostenso library and see if it mentions 

Well that might work if Ione is still Ione

So How did they know the moment I went outside

 I dont know Security cast really cast Id have noticed if he did something weird a bunch of standard detection spells at the edge of the Forbiddance There wasnt a scry up on the other side or an alarm spell set to trip or any magic at all or anyone hidden and waiting couldve been someones bonded familiar a ways off with vision enhanced to see through invisibility Or could be Security was compromised or Pilar or me Or you I guess if were being thorough though even then theyd have had to have activated a magic item or something to alert people and the others ought to have noticed 

 why was Pilar there She isnt usually when you test your spells she wasnt when we did Detect Anxieties or Detect Desires Pilar had been checked and had totally satisfactory Anxieties and Desires but the plan had been not to have her mostly because there wasnt a good excuse to have her and not the other girls Oh and now that Carissa thinks about it the reason Pilar was there was obviously some weird thing to do with her oracle powers and she should not have completed that sentence aloud though probably Keltham would himself have noticed the discrepancy at some point 

Oh thats amusing So all of us got tagged by mind control at least once tonight possibly including Pilar herself possibly excluding Security if he was the source and it either went right through anti enchantment or it wasnt enchantment or it happened before I cast that blocker 

I am trying to figure out if my successful prediction about the results Id get from my poll about peoples surprising revelations if I date them also implies things like Its not Carissas headband because thats too obvious of a red herring or It wont be Pilar it will be one of the other girls and you already have enough information to figure out who but youre not actually going to figure it out before dating her because the information was too subtle

 I dont really understand what you mean Carissa confesses after a little while spent internally panicking that that is an accusation of some kind though it doesnt exactly sound like one

Of course not you have to be really far into a relationship with a girl before they can hear you talking about the eroLARP itself

Actually he should just check that Can you repeat back what I just said using your own words and then make some sort of inference about it which shows your brain is processing it

You said youre wondering if an implication of your successful prediction with the poll about peoples surprising revelations is that the cause of the Kuthonites being able to track us is not my headband because thats obvious misdirection or if another implication is that one of the girls betrayed us but you will have to date her to learn that Uh it sounds like you think Cheliax is lying to you some god or entity is trying to communicate with you But in a way that I dont think would work with prophecy broken and I dont know what you mean about my headband being misdirection whose misdirection

That which is above all gods but if you can hear me talking about it then thats some evidence against tropes being a thing here Never mind mostly a stupid thought and if it wasnt then I almost certainly have to see it on my own What would you say in real life is the chance you should swap out that shiny new headband that bypassed government Security checks

I wouldve said very low and that Acquisitions was being way too paranoid but I would also have said that about a Kuthonite attack and and I wouldnt even have put a probability on a war among the gods thats happened once in recorded history So if you think I should then I think Ill just concede youre better at thinking about this stuff and do that

It almost certainly wasnt the headband That said theres no reason not to swap it with a headband that has been in ordinary quiet use somewhere much less sensitive which you personally selected to make sure nobody in our supply network or command structure slipped in an evil headband for what would actually be the first time Never trust what you can verify

Im reluctant to leave the Forbiddance again right now but Ill take one off one of the dead Security and maybe swap again later once its safer to leave

Can she just do that And leave a receipt about the swap Wait do we feel comfortable around that giant sharp thing youre carrying in Alien Invasion Rehearsal Festivals it is often very not safe to steal weapons off dead aliens and for that matter if somebody actually invaded Civilization I expect theyd have a bad day trying to swipe weapons off Exception Handling

Yes Ill have to leave them a note and theyll be annoyed but see the logic its not like they wouldnt do the same thing if I were dead and there was cause The swords a 3 vicious cruel longsword it doesnt have an innate personality or defenses against being stolen and I already used it to kill its bearer so if it were going to manifest any it mightve done so then If its got tracking itd be impressively subtle tracking but I guess I shouldnt rule that out confidently I was a weapons enchanter by specialty so Ive looked at a lot of really fancy swords

What is a manufacturer doing at the site of combat nevermind economicmagic

What do we actually do now When does the project restart when do Asmodia and Pilar get back where do we sleep tonight

When Asmodia and Pilar get back depends on whether were at war with Nidal If we are theyre going to be using all our Raise Dead and Resurrection capacity for the military for a while I dont know how badly the villa is damaged but I think itll be in repairs for at least the next couple of weeks and they might decide to relocate us to the Imperial palace which is the only other place in Cheliax with a Forbiddance up and which has security adequate for an invasion from anywhere Ive heard of We can ask for that now if youd rather be somewhere where something awful didnt just happen while you rest and recover

And thats what I think you should do next is rest and recover People often need a couple of weeks off after their first real battle at the Worldwound and thats people born to our world with some dead siblings whove attended some public executions She looked it up they have those in Taldor too though they only make it really slow if the crime is treason or something Youre from farther and you might need longer and youre our most valuable resource itd be stupid to run you too hard

Ordinarily Id ask why you thought you knew the complete list of everywhere in Cheliax with a Forbiddance but Ill skip that since you think the complete list is the center of Governance plus one single secret government project that started up a couple of days ago and which you happen to work at You know I think thats the first time Ive ever heard you say something that sounds adorably naive and trusting compared to the mature cynicism of a wise young boy like myself

 giggle Fair Its a really really expensive spell but I guess I dont know there arent half a dozen other secret places they can relocate us to except that I think they might have done that rather than casting the Forbiddance here if any of them would have done I think probably the decision will be made once the site director is no longer dead unless you tell people you want to be somewhere safer right now which you should do if you think itll be good for you

Ill think about it while you immediately swap headbands before anyone listening has a chance to pull their own substitution ahead of you Shouldve thought of that faster

 right She goes back over to the other room heads over to the pile of bodies and finds a 2 headband because Security would be furious at her if she swaps for a 4 Changes it out 

There are people gathered around for a heal Of course they didnt interrupt her with Keltham even though he told them to She tells someone to knock on the door and ask for the heal in five minutes and then goes back to Keltham

Dath ilani shouldnt be weak enough to need two weeks of recovery time after their first experience with somebody trying to kill them should they Though they certainly have a very very different attitude towards violence than Cheliax You learn the potential for defense in reality so that aggression stays confined to counterfactuals Cheliax has public executions

Dath ilan has executions too in a certain sense if you intentionally cause someone elses True Death you dont get kicked to the Last Resort you get forcibly and preemptively cryosuspended Not as a deterrent obviously because ideal agents ignore those and Civilization doesnt build structures that would stop working if people became more ideal Because anybody that dangerous is more danger than Civilization wants to inflict on the non true murderers in the Last Resort Civilization has a motive to preemptively suspend people that dangerous irrespective of its effect on incentives its not a threat

Obviously if a Chronicler or a family member asked to be present at the preemptive suspension and the murderer didnt veto it Governance would hardly block them You could probably do it as an ordinary concerned citizen and its hard to see Governance stopping them without an overwhelmingly strong reason Governance which has way too much power to say no to things has to be very circumspect about what it actually says no to if it doesnt want the Annual Oops Its Time To Overthrow The Government Festival to suddenly turn real

Keltham has a suspicion that Cheliaxs public executions are not public in the sense of open to sufficiently concerned citizens wanting to make sure everything has been done correctly It rhymes with Carissas earlier claim that the thing to do with rats is feed them to other rats in a frenzy of cannibalistic death and sell tickets Public executions Keltham suspects have tickets though its the sort of thing he should check later maybe by asking Carissa what the equilibrium price of the tickets are rather than if the tickets exist at all if hes feeling paranoid that minute

Its not like its not consistent It would pass muster as fiction Low tech society with poorer coordination sustained by economicmagic with healing resurrections and afterlives Losing a finger isnt permanent until the distant Future can restore it there are clerics Not true death means you come back well you come back if you had enough money to buy insurance Life in Golarion must be a pretty different experience for its relatively wealthy people and relatively poor ones Like qualitatively different two worlds with different tech levels But everyone gets the afterlife it sounds like Unless they betray an oath Or Nethys touches them Or how common is that statue business he should check with somebody else Carissa doesnt seem like the type to fret about Statistically Improbable Awful Fates

And sure you can imagine a society like that where they dont give a shit about violence because the injuries arent permanent Where they dont give a shit about death because resurrection and afterlives A society where people getting near the end of their natural healthspan when theyre starting to feel sick enough and stupid enough that theyre not having fun would have violent fights to the death with one another like thats a sporting event actually maybe public executions wouldnt sell tickets those are probably much more boring compared to suicide sports So why are executions public Hell try to remember to ask later

You could tell a consistent story where a dath ilani boy would be a fragile little flower by comparison to all that and hed take a long time to recover from somebody almost sticking him with a sword and instead sticking that sword into a girl he met two days ago

Keltham doesnt like this story and hes trying to decide if thats his real self talking or just his gendertrope Well his gendertrope is him to no trivial degree hes at 102 out of 12 on the gendertrope identification scale And its not like zero optimization ever went into making the masculine gendertrope be a useful target for males to try to live up to But still

But its more that Keltham has a sense that theres something false about Cheliaxs rejection of the idea that violence could be harmful That it rhymes with Permanent Cheerfulness and Acting Like Sex Still Works Normally The pain is still real the suffering is still real even if the injury and death are temporary and discarnation isnt the end This is like the sort of weird equilibria exhibited as stuff that might happen if not for Civilization and not for mental training hence why people have to go on playing strange games with children to let them be not that A proving things to people equilibrium like a dukes crazy son being challenged to prove his courage by racing a rhinoceros Where people try to show off really hard how much injury and death dont matter to them and end up dumping Asmodias body in a corner without any respect shown to it while her souls not in it

If dath ilan had healing and resurrections it would not be like that He doesnt think the Kelthamverse would be like it either

Or maybe hes wrong He hasnt lived in the Kelthamverse plus healing resurrection and afterlives

But the fact that Chelish people still end up in shock for two weeks after their first fight with demons suggests that their forcing their minds to be disdainful of violences impact doesnt quite work Is possibly making things worse for them

I want to be safe not feel safer is what Keltham says to Carissa when she gets back I dont think the foreseeable difference in the psychological impact of a semifamiliar place where an attack happened versus a completely unfamiliar place somewhere else is great enough to count against a 01 difference in actual securability And maybe this doesnt apply in this case but in dath ilan if a mental shock isnt mostly better in the morning and hasnt reached a new equilibrium after three days if its not better in the morning that would be the point at which youd talk to somebody smarter or better disciplined about mental errors you might be making that would cause internal conflicts to get stuck and not resolve I wont push myself if it turns out I cant recover that fast wont try to act outwardly normal if thats not true but its the recovery timescale I wouldve guessed if you hadnt mentioned anything

Oh and I register with my amateur Security posturing that it seems to me that bringing Pilar back or contacting her early in the afterlife to see if she has any idea how or why she was put there is a Security issue higher than her ordinary resurrection priority

 yes I should think that it is Ill pass that along and pass along that they should decide where to put us based on whatevers actually safest What a convenient preference from Keltham Itd be great if youre all right in a couple of days some people are and you can definitely talk to a priest about it if you want and some of the ways people arent all right might be irrelevant to you like people get flinchy in similar situations and thats a big liability if you have to hang out on the same wall fighting demons but much less of one if you never have to encounter a Kuthonite again

I have ever been through a trauma contingency class and am already forewarned against deciding to never talk to an archon again or wanting to spend the rest of my life staying inside Forbiddances But positive reinforcement for double checking

You know another thing thats conventional wisdom at the Worldwound is that after a big rush all the survivors should get laid because it prevents trauma No one really believes it prevents trauma but its a good excuse

Heh Conventional wisdom in dath ilan would be wait for the next morning to not form weird associations I suspect that even for a tremendously resilient masculine male like myself this is a next morning thing

As you like She thinks the associations are the point but that sounds like a losing argument 

If they always follow violence with sex that could like possibly be an important factor in understanding Chelish society Still he shouldnt rush to conclude that a previously unobserved social equilibrium cant have any useful functions for the people who equilibrated with it

I wouldnt stop you if 

Wait what

Brain probe

I apparently would want to stop you if you wanted to run off and have sex with somebody else instead unless it was with somebody I already knew and then I might have different opinions depending on my relationship to them To be extremely super clear I remember the explicit conversation we had yesterday about that exact topic where it was explicitly said we were not committing to other stuff like that by deciding to have sex

Snuggle But itd be nice if it were your call who I had sex with Itd be sexy It feels right

And coincidentally all of the other girls who marked down high scores on his romantic interestingness scale plus one who hid herself and is the traitor will all have equally impossible and un realistically evolvable sexualities configured around the exact details of his unreasonable preferences

Keltham doesnt say anything about how convenient because this is not on that hypothesis Carissas own fault in any way nor would she have the ability to explain it Unless its the other path to the same end Chelish Governance faking an elaborate ero LARP around him

Or on the less literary hypotheses of reality maybe dath ilan has no masochists because nobody ever tried following up severe nonsimulated violence with sex He wants to think it cant be that simple because somebody in Civilization really would have figured it out and then figured out a less costly way to get the same result But if its some weird brain thing you cant guess from parts of the model pinned down by other observations maybe they really wouldnt have figured it out Or maybe nobody would volunteer for the Wanting To Be Hurt Process even if it didnt take the nonsimulated violence because um

Aw crap Keltham says That gets into serious sex stuff which in turn reminds me I wrote down a list of my pending questions that I managed not to ask you during sex It was in my bedroom I wonder if it survived the invasion Or I wonder if Security picked it up I used a second layer of naughtiness spoiler cipher to write it which is the highest level of spoiler I can read reflexively Is Comprehend Languages going to go right through that Its legit kind of personal

Comprehend Languages cant read ciphers I could go and get 

Theres a knock on the door Uh someone says ducking their head we were told to get you for healing

On it

While hes doing that Carissa will clean her dress and tell Security about Pilar and about Kelthams instructions for where to put him and think at them some more details about the plan which is approximately just to keep Keltham happy and wait for Maillol who she assumes theyll have just after dawn and who she expects will be really angry with her though shes not sure about what And can someone go to Kelthams bedroom and possibly actually use Shrink Item to move his entire bed to the library and grab ciphered notes 

Is this everyone Keltham says when he sees the next version of the room I may have two healing surges left I doubt I have three

This is everyone The room is fairly packed and nearly all male most but not all of the new arrivals are uniformed

Keltham background notices the gender disparity and background updates that pseudoviolent professions well actually violent in this case may have the same gendertrope association in Cheliax as in Civilization This is too unsurprising to propagate much updateness elsewhere

Heal More Heal

And thats it for the day

Actually why arent they already saturated on fourth circle priests who would have teleported in and done this already File it under things to maybe remember to ask later

Securitys going to bring you your possessions from your bedroom I suggested they also bring the bed since this is the only secured part of the villa right now we can set it up in that back room

Wheres everyone else sleeping Not to amateur argue with Security but if Im the only one sleeping here overnight and everyone else is going back to Ostenso that does seem like the point where itd be cheaper to set me up in the palace instead of protecting the whole place just for me To be clear Im not expressing a preference just a puzzlement

I think everyone else is probably going to sleep on the library floor

Ive never actually wanted to sleep in the same bed as other people so I havent found out if I actually can but I will at the very least note that I would be okay sleeping in a smaller bed and letting others use my large one Even if I picked tonight to be the moment when I find out whether I can fall asleep next to you which doesnt sound like a terrible thing to try at least once that still only requires a significantly smaller bed

I dont know if the villa of the Archduke of Sirmium has any normal sized beds but I can suggest that they look But also well be fine the girls were about to enlist and theres a lot of sleeping on the ground on the trip up to the Worldwound

Keltham a tired Security man says from the doorway

Question mark

Im so sorry but your room appears to have been targeted as an early priority during the attack With a lot of Fireballs We have some people casting Mending now but we dont expect your possessions to be salvageable His head remains ducked

Something feels off about his presentation to Carissas mental model of Keltham but shes not sure if its a Cheliax versus Taldor off or a Golarion versus dath ilan off 

 didnt have anything important in there except some nonvital notes

Its not fun though to find out that he cant leave important stuff in his room because it might get destroyed

Or that Nidal or Zon Kuthon directly was watching him closely enough to know where he sleeps wait

Belief inconsistency If the attack was timed to the moment I tried to step outside why were they specially targeting my bedroom they wouldnt expect me to be there

He looks up at Keltham thats a very good question I have no idea Would they have thought youd left something important there Something theyd have wanted to steal or destroy

 for that matter why fight their way through the villa at all if they knew he was on the perimeter of the grounds Did it seem from Security in the villas perspective like most of the attackers were going for the villa

 that was indicated in the first communications we got but communications stopped pretty quickly if they changed targets twenty seconds in I wouldnt know no survivors in the villa who didnt make it to the library though and apparently there were some survivors outdoors gesture at the two of them 

Yeah All right That makes no sense to me at all

Theres a saying out of dath ilan backed by a Law I might otherwise have been teaching tomorrow maybe still will if Im in shape for it Your strength in the Law is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality if youre equally good at explaining anything you could possibly see you have zero knowledge because your degrees of surprise dont distinguish any possible event from any other possible event

I notice that we are confused Therefore something we believe is fiction

 could his god have timed it that exactly Kelthams bedroom being full of fire is not happy news about what would have happened if his god hadnt done that

Carissa is pretty sure this guy isnt lying but if he is she is going to show him a lot of Fireballs She can only cast a few per day but presumably someone will courteously leave him chained to something for as many days as it takes

What do we believe about what happened That someone caused Pilar to be with us and our departure not to be the secret it was intended to be That Nidal detected you leaving the Forbiddance and attacked That despite knowing where you were they went through the villa and killed most of its defenders That they Fireballed your room how many rooms are similarly destroyed 

I havent done a full inventory but an explosion took out half the west wing thats how they entered and the banquet hall and the four rooms adjacent to it are burned as thoroughly Of course if you were guessing which room an important guest was in youd probably guess Kelthams its the suite styled for House Thrune when theyre in Ostenso 

I am not a domain expert on Golarion but If I try to come at this from a dath ilani angle We can probably premise more strongly than we can premise almost any other part of this that the timing between my stepping outside and the attack was not coincidental Its to within something like one in five hundred parts of the day or less for it to be a coincidence that tight is something wed see once in five hundred times

We then have a classic probability theoretic detective story that of accounting for coincidence in particular a coincidence of timing

Suppose that prophecy being broken we dont believe that any god managed to time it in advance by sheer prediction We furthermore believe Nidal didnt see me stepping outside because they didnt know where Id be

Then some other element of the sequence of events that led to me being outside must have triggered the attack or been timed with the attack

Furthermore though more tentatively at least one element in this sequence of events was chosen by an adversary of Nidal because they plausibly wouldve gotten me inside my bedroom otherwise

This causal sequence started with my asking to cast my cleric spells no it started with Carissa returning from her shopping trip at the exact time she did It ended when I summoned the archon But I doubt Carissa should be looking for anything that timed the end of her shopping trip because she had dinner after that and with prophecy broken you wont get two minute timing at the end of a causal sequence like that

Something in that causal sequence either triggered the attack or was triggered by it

When did Ione get her vision

Maybe eighteen maybe twenty four seconds before the attack

Why not send her a vision earlier Cheliax could have been better prepared An obvious possibility is that the assault was not legible until the last minute maybe because it was successfully obscured from whoever sent Ione the vision But the assault was legible enough for my own god to send me a spell vision of Zon Kuthons afterlife the previous day

If Nidal were otherwise planning an attack in an hour say but had eyes on Ione but not me they might have concluded they needed to attack as fast as possible after she gave her warning in order to preserve as much surprise as they could So Ione got the vision as soon as I was outside of the primary targeted zone inside the villa I want to say that if thats the case whoever sent her the vision had a grimdark sense of humor but it could have just been the best solution to an optimization problem

We could have handled it without casualties if wed had five minutes of warning maybe Zon Kuthons people had some way to know wed been tipped off and reacted to the Security alert that went out immediately after the vision 

I want to emphasize that this entire mode of thinking is almost definitely completely illegitimate but since somebody just happened to mention to me this morning that gods get clearer vision when they have clerics around is there any not incredibly expensive way to check for sure whether one of the other girls in the library with Ione was a first circle cleric of Zon Kuthon who therefore looks just like a second circle Lawful Evil wizard to Aura Sight

It is sometimes said in dath ilan If you put your reasoning into overdrive you will often get somewhere and the trouble is you will often also get somewhere else

The screening involved asking them under a truth spell after other magic on them had been dispelled about affiliations and commitments to other gods There are a couple non Asmodeans but no one who was secretly Kuthonite

A couple non Asmodeans is a little high but not incredibly high she adds to Keltham as Securitys not allowed to proffer that obvious lie The teen years are when kids experiment with religion and are likeliest to be followers of random gods

Probably a complete empty set search but if we havent figured out anything else suppose you repeat that screen in case somebody got clericed shortly after she got here doublecheck whoever does the second screening and consider that if something like that isnt impossible she may not know her new god is Zon Kuthon or may somehow not know shes a cleric Zon Kuthon could just not give her any spells Or she could have a hot swappable personality one self whos a cleric and one self whos not I should say the same logic which suggests this whole bit also suggests that whatever test we come up with is not going to detect her

We can do that he says a bit skeptical but mostly just very tired 

And then another uniformed person looking significantly sharper and ineffably more dangerous steps in Her Imperial Majesty invites the traveler Keltham and any companionship he desires to the palace in Egorian while repairs are underway on his present residence

Oh good something for Carissa to do aside from quietly panicking about how Keltham is using a reasoning process that he thinks is above the gods Beyond the gods and which therefore she has no idea how to feed the wrong information and which is therefore going to ruin everything

The something to do is of course accept a personal invitation from Her Imperial Majesty to her home but you know at least she understands where she stands with that

Governance at the Legislator or Chief Executive level in dath ilan does not have literally zero formality Keltham can recognize a cue to go into Dealing With Very Serious People mode He stands a little straighter

I accept at least for myself and for a set of others to be determined momentarily if youll give me that moment

Carissa who am I supposed to invite with me is that like you the other researchers the survivors of the villa what

Is Her Imperial Majestys generous invitation aimed at the relocation of the project or is her intent better understood as that Keltham relax and recover in greater comfort and safety while preparations for the project to restart are underway

While I cannot speak for her Kelthams comfort and safety are at this time the highest of our project related priorities

Me and anyone else youll want not for classes

Is Ione a not for classes Definitely not in the Carissa sense yet I accept on behalf of myself and Carissa Sevar When and if Ione recovers she will be valuable for my learning even if I am not teaching

Do you have possessions youll need to gather

I do

I dont

Accompany her he says to local Security and to Keltham with your permission I intend to cast a series of spells that will dispel external magical influences on you detect any enchantment of your possessions or person and guard against future such

Carissa and local Security head out

Understood I currently have running a self cast protective cleric spell on my person and an external Share Language that will expire shortly I would have both of those preserved if there is zero or nearly perfectly zero risk to Security thereby but more so the protective spell as it is less replaceable Regardless of rulings there I consent to your described Security measures

Enchantment Foil he says We of course cannot cast it on you at all without the aid of extraordinarily powerful magic as it is a spell that can affect the caster only I will avoid dispelling it

And he does magic visibly intricate and high powered to Detect Magic mostly divinations but also some abjurations

Keltham wont remember hes a magicbearer until halfway through that but once he does hell cast Detect Magic and watch He also notes that upper Cheliax Security isnt claiming not to know what Enchantment Foil is which matches an earlier hypothesis about it being a Security only spell that can be used to defeat Security measures

Carissa returns with the products of her recent shopping trip in her shopping trip Bag of Holding along with her notes and her presents from the Queen just as this is wrapping up Security finishes with Keltham and turns to cast the same set of spells on her and on the things in her Bag of Holding 

Lets go he says when hes finished and starts walking

Keltham follows

Oh he does have a tiny bit of trauma associated with Leaving The Villa Premises what fun

The sky above is still doing the thing that gets giant aliens to say Those above all mortals now battle in a deep grumbly voice Its pretty at night

Its terrifying

Asmodeus is going to win but still

They reach the edge of the Forbiddance and the man takes their hands and without preamble Teleports

The palace in Egorian is new built after House Thrune took Cheliax the old capitol was in Westcrown It makes the summer villa of the Archduke look shabby by comparison It makes Versailles its best historical analogue look shabby though admittedly mostly only because of things King Louis the 14th could not have helped like the fact his gargoyles cannot prowl and his fountains cannot start in midair and his orchards cannot grow seductively golden apples that drive men mad

The sky is flickering here too

Well good on them for remembering to fake the skyshow here too if its fake But Keltham is mostly paying attention to other sights because theyre worth it

This place is beautiful and aesthetic even by our standards and on behalf of Civilization I compliment the architects and designers 

Wait Is teleporting always that fast That sort of matches his experience at the Worldwound in retrospect but he had almost no experience with magic and spells back then and didnt know he was looking at a spell and not a device that had charged up over the last three minutes Though it wasnt so much that he had alternate hypotheses back then as that he hadnt really chunked spellcasting rules as a latent system in a way that would make it easy to update over modular facts inside it

Teleportation is a fifth circle spell with the same casting time as the spells that you are familiar with the wizard confirms 

Sorry just trying to figure out an ongoing mystery about the attack Carissa am I missing something or should that Security have just teleported us out when the attack started We were at the edge of the Forbiddance already

If he had it prepared and hadnt yet used it today yes and was at least fifth circle but his Haste lasted ten count so he was

So maybe he couldnt teleport Or maybe he could but if you didnt think of that at the time its plausible he didnt think of it either But if my god didnt predict my Security not having teleport or not thinking of it thats an even stronger reason for my god to try to get me to the edge of the Forbiddance in a way that could be synchronized with the attack It would have been a reliable plan for my safety not the better than worst harm reduction version where I still almost got killed several times Though its also worth asking where the obvious place to teleport wouldve been and if there couldve been an ambush there or if theres any way to intercept a teleport and 

Well later Sorry for the interruption Please lead on

Otolmens is VERY BUSY She is guarding the Vault containing ROVAGUG while Zon Kuthon gets DEALT WITH not that His VOID CONTAMINATED MIND shouldnt have been dealt with IMMEDIATELY but BETTER LATE THAN NEVER

She is not SO BUSY that she is NEVER looking back at the anomaly AT ALL

It is now NO LONGER within one hundred distance units of Ostensos tallest thing It is ELSEWHERE

For some reason Otolmens had been thinking that just since the anomaly had mostly stayed in the same place for a while it was a kind of anomaly that did that

She cannot go on revising Pharasmas Name edicts once theyre issued for the obvious reason that this would correspond to an unbounded edict supply

ASMODEUS

TELL your MORTALS to put the anomaly BACK IN THE INTERDICTED REGION

Transparently EVADING a Pharasmas Name Edict is NOT AMUSING and PHARASMA will NOT BE AMUSED EITHER

ASMODEUS IS SORT OF BUSY WHILE PUTTING NEARLY AS MUCH EFFORT INTO SUBDUING THIS LONGSTANDING EXISTENTIAL THREAT AS THE REST OF THESE USELESS WEAKLING GODS COMBINED AND WILL GET BACK TO OTOLMENS LATER

They go in through a side entrance because the Queen has ordered that no one will come into contact with Keltham whose soul is not sold already or who isnt a priest of Asmodeus Theres a dazzling hallway and then a room that is 

 well exquisitely designed to some unapologetically Evil aesthetics It has thick red velvet curtains around an enormous iron bed which has actual chains and shackles built into the headboard and a thick red carpet and an enormous fireplace against one wall

Next to the fireplace is a rack of fire stoking equipment which a person who knows a lot about fire stoking which Keltham hopefully does not might identify as not even all that useful for that

Theres a cozy reading nook with an armchair and a tall bookshelves full of leather bound books and a little kneeling pillow next to the armchair

Theres an Asmodean shrine with incense and a stone ritual seat that you obviously let blood into 

There are beautiful tapestries on the walls depicting well dressed people dancing and theres a window opening on a courtyard full of blooming roses

 Carissas life is so interesting derogatory whatre the books Oh good looks like theyre Taldane poetry and a fourteen volume history of Absalom dated from before the Age of Lost Omens began

Keltham mostly notices the chains on the bed They dont parse instantly but he can deduce their use after a few moments

Keltham smiles slightly I want to say somebodys overestimated our relationship progress but on second thought maybe not

I like the rest of the aesthetic Its very close to a similar dath ilani aesthetic called doompunk which I do not totally fail to appreciate

You can press this bell for staff says their escort and departs 

Doompunk huh Im glad you like it It parses as an Evil aesthetic here

 interesting in dath ilani terms thats more associated with a self aware supervillain with a sense of humor one who laughs maniacally while executing their cunning plans and also knows exactly how much of a cliche that is and does it anyways because thats them living their best life I dont think wed say its associated with Evil supervillains rather than Good supervillains though If anything it leans slightly the opposite

Supervillain parses as a kind of thing thatd only be Evil a lich commanding enormous armies of the undead or a wizard who has concocted a mad scheme to end life or something

Commanding armies of the undead is supervillainy absolutely extremely doompunk too but I dont see why that would be Good or Evil in itself aside from whatever you were trying to do with the undead armies And a wizard with a mad scheme to end life is Good as I understand that because theyre not doing it to benefit themselves theyre doing it because they think life should be ended for its own welfare well in dath ilani fiction thats why theyd be doing it if that happens in real life here maybe its very different but then why would they

World destroying supervillains in dath ilani fiction are by default and absent deliberate subversion or aversion of the trope negative utilitarians Dath ilani take for granted in the background and without thinking much of it that their literary characters make as much sense as everything else does on their planet fictional antagonists are being animated by dath ilani authors who will grant those simulated minds at least the mental skills taught to children There just arent many things you can intelligently want to accomplish by destroying reality except for preferring that stuff which exists not exist

 in stories in Golarion itd mostly be for revenge because they feel the world wronged them And the undead armies would be because the lich wants to be personally rich and powerful so he wants to conquer countries to do it It makes sense that since your society is so Good your supervillains would be too

I just dont see how being a supervillain is an alignment correlated thing at all Its an aesthetic not a utility function specification of what goals people pursue I wanted to be a supervillain when I grew up and while this was not a realistic life goal nobody would have listed that as a reason why I was any more Evil than anyone else The guy heading up our Moon colony is a supervillain his bedroom probably looks basically like this one but with a real sleeping surface and minus the chains

 The compound word super villain began as a fictional trope in dath ilan but the corresponding real life aesthetic and gender trope and famous person behavior pattern later took over as the primary meaning of supervillain in Baseline and the compound no longer means quite what its conjuncts say This Baseline term is now translating oddly to Taldanes cognate for their real world version of the old dath ilani fictional trope based on a similar compound which in Taldane has preserved its original meaning In Civilization supervillain hasnt primarily referred to anything fictional since long before Keltham was born and hes not particularly thinking about the underlying Baseline components super villain nor even that this well worn formerly compound but now specialized term has components let alone the etymology of the word

 so most powerful people are Evil In Golarion I think pretty much all of them who arent part of some specific Good religious order I imagine thats very different in dath ilan but wanting power except I want to study so much magic that lots of people come to my wizard tower to buy magic from me is youre almost definitely if you actually pull it off going to have assassinated some people ordered some children drowned so they wont be competition for your throne those are examples from a Taldane history she read this morning And I guess you could do that while still intending Good but the sorting doesnt just pay attention to your self serving narrative and if youre killing lots of people to amass power its almost definitely going to call you Evil And you cannot become powerful without killing lots of people

 because if you try Zon Kuthon sends military squads after you and you wont survive unless you kill them first Im not having an easy time figuring out what killing people has to do with getting power In my visualization it mostly gets you dead people which at least where I come from you cant take a bunch of corpses to the neighborhood bartering fair and say Would somebody like to trade me a lot of power for this bunch of corpses

 well what you do is you kill the people who were in charge of a place and then you kill anyone who says youre not in charge now And thats how becoming in charge of places works pretty much

Assuming this works at all why isnt the whole world ruled by the one most powerful person who can kill anybody else who then declares that nobody else is allowed to kill anybody so that their world will operate in a quiet and orderly fashion and not go through a lot of annoying unprofitable chaos

Because its not actually all that much more fun to rule the entire world than to rule a country the size of Cheliax and because there are a bunch of gods trying to counterbalance each others power and because there are random ninth circle wizards who cant be bothered to straighten out everywhere but who make it very clear that if you harass the peasants right on their doorstep then theyll dismantle you for parts and because lots of parts of the world are too distant and rural and low population and speak languages no one else speaks and its not clear its worth ruling them and because empires dont generally grow past the distance limit of a Teleport if it costs several its incredibly costly to bring enough force over to keep your distant provinces in line

I am willing to believe you about all of that but as a dath ilani I am used to knowing why equilibria balance where they do and I am very far from understanding that here I get the basic point that if 01 of a countrys population is 90 of its military power they can form an internal coalition and not let anybody else vote assuming the populace hasnt otherwise been trained in the decision theory of coordinating their refusal of an unfair bargain I could not then predict that this coalition adopts rules that look like if you kill the person at the top of us you now own our city Why dont the 01 of the people with 90 of the military power form their own government of revocable delegations among themselves If one person at the top has 51 of the military power it should work a way which is them running everything If 1 and 2 can gang up to beat 0 but get beaten in turn by 3 4 and 5 it would work a different way I need to play through some minigame for how this works with like six people before I try to visualize how it works for a planet What is the simplest case with the smallest number of people all of whom are on the gameboard not just in the background somewhere where youd kill somebody and get power

Sure Imagine a small village on a river somewhere far north with poor farmland maybe claimed by a distant King but he neither collects taxes nor enforces law so he doesnt feature in this story In practice the village is led by a priest of I dunno Pharasma who is the only person in the village with magic when villagers accuse each other of crimes he hears them out and fines or punishes the one at fault He collects a tax from them for the church of ten percent of their fields Then someones wayward son who went off to be an adventurer comes back third circle capable of impressive things rich with goods from out of town and he is welcomed back by his family until he drunkenly hits someone else in a quarrel over a girl and kills them because hes an adventurer now and hits harder And this is brought up before the old priest and the priest says the adventurer must pay a fine and serve the family of the man he killed at harvest and planting time for ten years in the place of the laborer he took from them and the adventurer spits in his face and then kills him too and then says hey from now on Im the one who will hear out accusations of crime in this village

Leaving aside the decorative horror and focusing on the underlying game theory So Even assuming the villagers have no way of killing the adventurer even by cooperatively sacrificing themselves theres a saying in dath ilan Anyone can kill anyone but they probably shouldnt and maybe thats just not true here in which case fine and even assuming they dont all go fuck this guys unfair division of gains from trade lets head to the afterlife and leave him with an empty village then if nothing exists in the world outside this village if there are no hidden players not on the gameboard then it would seem to be in this persons best interests not to let anyone else kill anybody and run the whole village for his own profit until somebody else comes along whos stronger and kills him Which is the case I described before

I agree that assuming the villagers let the adventurer get away with that and dont just leave for the afterlife if one is a fourth circle cleric one could perhaps come in and kill the adventurer and get a little sad bit of power It doesnt seem like something that scales The reason it works is that its isomorphic to a two player game where one player has all power and the other player has none but goes along with an unfair division of gains instead of leaving for the afterlife

 your confusion is why the adventurer doesnt ban killing in the village He probably does He doesnt run the whole village for his own profit but mostly because that would be more likely to make people get fed up and leave having to deal with one asshole who also maintains order is one thing but if hes also raising taxes a lot and picking fights and taking wives then at some point people leave so he is limited in how much he fucks with them

I dont think I think the villagers could kill him by cooperatively sacrificing themselves But why would they do that individually it just results in them being dead

So I was going to say that maybe you didnt have enough Law to solve that problem but it sounds like you have an artificial substitute which would be fine for something like this Swear an oath that only binds you to action after youve heard every adult in the village swear the same oath Publicly generate random numbers Three people picked by the random numbers or however many it takes sacrifice themselves to kill the adventurer

Put up a sign outside your village saying this is how your village does stuff The adventurer reads the sign and goes somewhere else so the people never even have to sacrifice themselves Other people hear about what a great adventurer free village that was and say Hey why dont we put up a sign like that too

 so in Cheliax where children grow up understanding that they are Lawful and that means something maybe you could make something like that work But in most places people wont actually go to their deaths because they swore they would not all of them not enough of them that that works I dont think and more people would just decline to swear to it in the first place because its not that bad having an adventurer be in charge of your village And some peopled read the sign and take it as a challenge And its weird so people wouldnt do it

I was going to say something about it sounds like you might have a problem that gods and ideal agents dont have which is a key fact that I needed to hear in order to understand what is going on but I am suddenly arrested by the possibly even more important notion of its weird so people wouldnt do it which sounds like it would stabilize literally any possible behavior because if everyone does that then any other behavior is weird

 I mean yes But but most weird things that someone smarter than you came up with and that you dont fully understand arent in your interests so not doing weird things is better than doing weird things if youre not very smart

I may possibly need to think about that for a bit

You do that Im going to figure out whether they gave us a key to the chains or whether theyre supposed to be magically operated

They have a big iron key Very fancy Wizards into bondage usually use Unseen Servants which can only apply twenty pounds of force but are enough for if youre not expecting serious physical opposition twenty pounds feels like a lot shaped right 

So

Their world has people who are more smart or less smart just like his world

Lots of smarter people however are out to exploit less smarted people using adversarially selected arguments

So the less smarted people have to freeze in place and only believe what they were told by their parents Keltham guesses because even if somebody wandering into the village looks as dumb as you they could be a smart person faking that

Nobody has any Law inspired concept of validity or which arguments are admissible or inadmissible or how to go about constructing a narrower class of arguments that could still contain important stuff while being harder for smarter adversaries to exploit Their books are endless strings of non sequiturs and impossible leaps and emotion invocations and when your contest of ideas is on that level there is nothing you can do to stop a clever adversary from doing a search that Goodharts through any flaws or loopholes in the resistance of a dumber argument considerer

 or maybe dath ilan would also be like this Law or no Law if not for the Keepers and the fact that the Keepers are so far as Keltham knows Good Just given whats publicly known about talk control most dath ilani can little more resist a high ranked Keeper going all out on exploiting their own flaws than a villager of this world could resist the arguments of a wizard if the villager was foolish enough to hear out a stranger

But what is he supposed to do about that if thats the case Even if he can mass manufacture intelligence headbands they wont change the relative intelligence well no because currently the smartest people get intelligence headbands and the less smart people dont so at the very minimum fixing that would have to shift the equilibrium relative to what it is now 

Thanks for my evening update on how awful Golarion is Keltham says out loud and not without a certain irony

More of an update than the Kuthites were

The Kuthites are a problem and if theyve penetrated your security theyre much more of a problem but they are a relatively shallow and understandable problem compared to average intelligence people not being able to trust that all the arguments they hear arent out to get them

 fair enough Yeah I dont know how you solve that without the resources of the Church You do have the resources of the Church though and with that its solvable though slowly you open schools and you feed the kids at school and so parents send the kids to school even if they worry itll teach things they cant trust and then other people notice things that cant be faked like that the kids are more prosperous and over generations people come around 

Orrrrr I could figure out how to mine spellsilver in the sort of volume that Civilization gets when Civilization wants lots of a rare metal and make intelligence headbands for wizards who would then craft more headbands and give all of the villagers intelligence headbands and do it not over generations Theres a place in life for doing things the slow way with diligent hard work and that place is when there is in fact no shortcut whatsoever for doing things a faster way

Yes all right certainly the give them all Intelligence headbands plan is better though Ill note that the fanciest most expensive headband will enhance a slightly duller than average peasant up to 14 which is still you know not smart enough Cheliax puts you on projects that require the ability to make decisions independently

Its a start on half of a solution 2 in dath ilan isnt too dumb to learn the sort of Law youve been learning in my lessons youd just learn it a couple of years later

It would be the most important thing thatd ever happened well see what problems remain after that

 I want some If you invent a way to mine arbitrary spellsilver

How much do you want he said bearing in mind that he didnt have any grasp of units and would need those translated into least expensive headband and unskilled labor year units

More than I know what to do with More than I could use even if I spent every waking moment on fancy complicated enchanted projects That would be twenty or so least expensive headbands a day and there is no sense giving you a value in unskilled labor years because I do not expect to get this wish of mine if spellsilver mining continues to cost unskilled labor years but the current state is that a headband is 55 unskilled labor years

So assuming unskilled laborers work four hours per day averaged over rest days 

Wait Keltham suspects he may have made an important unit conversion error throwing off several other calculations

And the number of unskilled labor hours in one unskilled labor year

4500ish I suppose

Blink blink

Thats around thirteen hours a day including rest days if those even exist unless your year doesnt have 3652422 days per year

We have three hundred sixty exactly There are two festivals

 what that makes no sense at all In dath ilan the time between spring equinox of one year and the spring equinox of the next year is 3652422 days the amount of time it takes dath ilan to complete exactly one orbit around the sun is 3652596 days and I have absolutely no idea how having two festivals could interact with either of those quantities

 the number of days it takes for the sun to complete its orbit is 360 rather than 365 and as an answer to your separate question about rest days there are two of them

Welp Im going to chalk up those insane work hours and lack of rest as hopefully a problem merely of quantitative productivity rather than a Horrifying Golarion Structural Equilibrium that will persist even in the presence of infinite machinery and then Im going to only think about it insofar as that serves the purpose of doing something about it sound like a plan

Sounds great I wanted to daydream about mountains of spellsilver here not be sad about global problems

Among the many ways of viewing your global problems is that they are caused by some missing mountains of spellsilver and if were going to go looking for those anyways we might as well keep one mountain for ourselves Thats what being Evil is all about

Youre going to say things like that to me and then have some kind of societal norm of not having sex on days when bad things happened Can I at least kiss you

This is the most bizarrely fascinating bedroom talk that Abrogail has ever spied upon in possibly her entire life and she genuinely does not see how Sevar is going to pull this off If Sevar manages to tempt and corrupt Keltham from this starting point she will get her County

You miiiight have to explain first how kissing works the word sounds like the lip touching thing and all I knew about that was to mirror what you did Not that we couldnt just improvise so long as its the sort of thing that goes well when improvised

Abrogail has things to do and now she has to choose between doing those things and continuing to spy on this which is unfortunate having that never happen to her is something she should have thought to write into her compact with Asmodeus somehow

You havent invented kissing Well I suppose then as Golarions duly appointed representative to Keltham it is my duty to try to explain it to you though its popular because it does in fact go well when improvised See you can do a little kiss like this she repeats last night which just says I like you and I want you or you can do a little more than that

And hes kissing back in a very uninspired way Well this was a good time for things to get boring she supposes It is apparently time to end her brief break and actually attend her war council Gorthoklek is almost finished breaking down her door

Likewise mortal but longer lived things a hair closer to ideal agency though still far from it now battle

Their objective to bring enough pressure to bear on Zon Kuthon outside the vault that He must choose between being inside that vault and significantly ceasing to be Maybe not ceasing entirely but becoming perhaps a fallen being a mere demigod He must choose between going into the vault and that

The assembled gods cannot reasonably endeavor to kill all of Zon Kuthon if He chooses the latter path Gods encrypt their energies arrange their potentials in lattices and arrays to which only they have keys Like a box full of bouncing classical gas atoms that can be made to all end up on the boxs left side in apparent defiance of thermodynamics and ready to yield up their heat as a pressure if you know the secret for how those atoms were originally set in motion to be able to end up like that with the right tweak Anybody who doesnt know the secret just sees a box full of a useless uniform gas

In likewise way a being under such assault as Zon Kuthon may scatter little shards of Himself here and there too small and subtle for now to be noticed but destined to collide and gather up at some future time a time when His adversaries are paying less attention no longer spending all Their own power and watchfulness to launch a coordinated assault on Him blanketing Golarion and the other planes where He extends

Among the greatest of adventurers who yet do not quite understand it is whispered that only by killing a great Power within Their own home plane is it possible to destroy that Power permanently and also that a Power within its home plane is nearly invincible

These whispers are not quite accurate The key concept rather and from mortals it is hidden is that gods face a tradeoff between weakness and vulnerability They can gather themselves up and become stronger but only at the risk of their own true destruction Any problem which requires you to become unified and powerful and localized and therefore vulnerable to any still greater force is a challenge you should face on your own home ground if you possibly can On the very rare occasions when Powers are truly slain therefore they tend to fall within their home planes after ascending to terrifying heights within it

The assembled gods then know that they can only force so much of Zon Kuthon into the vault prepared for Him As He could survive as a demigod outside it He can also go mostly into the vault but leave a demigods worth of Himself outside That demigods worth of power will not be able to free Rovagug though and that is all the assembled gods are aiming for

Most of them that is

Nethys sure will really be in trouble if anyone finds out He did this part

Nethys sees every part of Zon Kuthon Nethys knows where every part of Zon Kuthon is trying to hide

Nethys provides those coordinates to Someone Else

Thats the sort of divine backstab that if found out would get every large or obvious remaining piece of Nethys assaulted by more Golarion gods than are currently assaulting Zon Kuthon

The only reason the gods are not currently that scared of Nethys is because it has not up until now seemed like Nethys is particularly likely to do that sort of thing to tattle on gods secrets to one another to start wars between Them in which Nethys will pick sides and provide aid weakening Them until all the gods that Nethys doesnt like or maybe all the other gods period have been killed

It would not be in Nethyss seeming interests to start down that path because you cant conceal that sort of thing forever

But that logic is not unassailable and other gods will be watching for early signs

Nethys is doing this part anyways

Snip Snip Snip

Shes mostly appearing to fight Zon Kuthon along with the other gods but it doesnt take much extra power to kill those little defenseless bits of Zon Kuthon if you know exactly where to look for them

Carissa finds it hard to think around Keltham 

Not in a stupid romantic way she doesnt think though shes aware its the obvious interpretation She thinks its more that all of her mind has to be pointed at him She has to be paying attention to the surroundings the conversation the connected distant implications the opportunities for flirtation she has to be directing most of her mind at the deception surrounding Keltham and also impress him with the quality of conversation she can generate with the part of her mind thats on him 

As a result the sober Carissa diagnosis of what shes like around Keltham is that shes fundamentally reactive She follows trains of thought of his she answers his questions She teases him She ventures a bit of promising theology occasionally if shes feeling bold But she cannot construct an overarching plan Which is fine not that debilitating it just means she needs one in advance but tonight has been kind of eventful and the plan she had before they went to practice Kelthams cleric spells is a bit outdated 

Kissing Keltham leaves more space to think than talking to him does so she persists in it even once she would ordinarily declare that quite enough kissing

She wants to convince him to fuck her Shes pretty sure that this is an important step in building intimacy It involves him trusting her with something and her demonstrating that trust warranted and in her not really very professional judgment its the best sex act for his kinks its about power without obliging him to do a lot of deliberate and constructed making it about power which hes still learning how to do 

She wants to gently introduce in a testing the waters kind of way the ideas that 1 some girls are into out there stuff Carissas about average and that means half of girls are kinkier than her see where that line of thought takes him 2 power is more interesting when its not a game nobles play for fun isnt it and 3 the thing that makes this right is that Keltham wants it and can get it

The third one seems hard She spent a fair share of her beauty appointment playing it in her head with imaginary Keltham 

You want it and can get it Thats what matters thats why its all right its all right for you to have things assuming you can get them without breaking the Law

Imaginary Keltham Right but the reason the Law doesnt prohibit this is that you also want it Otherwise it would If you try to propose a Law that says it doesnt matter what you want then all the people where the Law agrees it doesnt matter what they want would simply overthrow the Law and replace it with a Law who didnt say that and even if they wouldnt they could in principle so the Law cant say that

You want it and can get it Does it does it feel like theres something important there Something that dath ilan would be missing if they treated that as sort of a sideshow that gets to rise to relevance only if every other feature of the situation has lined up just right

Imaginary Keltham Well its relevant no matter what its just that sometimes the way in which its relevant is that society should try to have fewer people like me in it or that it needs to put more emphasis on people not doing things just because they want to 

You want it and can get it Thats itself appealing about you Maybe thats a very circuitous fetish but it feels very fundamental to me The trait that matters in the world is being able to get things you want and the most romantic situation is being wanted And that means theres inherently nothing sexier than someone who wants you and can get what he wants

That one feels promising but like it achieves its promisingness by running askew and probably being heresy again She still thinks its a line of argument worth attempting Maybe you can get someone to being willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want is sexy and then from there to being willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want is okay She still tries to imagine objections imaginary Keltham might have but Imaginary Keltham mostly says things like math youve never heard of proves that doesnt work which is a sign she needs to take this problem to Actual Keltham

Once she has a plan Which she doesnt yet so More kissing

Dath ilani learn fast generalize fast and get bored with a speed that would shock the more easily amused They overcomplicate sex because they have no choice They do their best to protect their kids from sexual spoilers so that young adults can have the joy of discovery and amusing stories to tell for the rest of their lives and also so that young adults dont exhaustively play out simple basic sex in their heads before having it which if they did would lead them to learn the pattern and get bored by it even faster

Even Keltham of the 08sd though is able to spend a while just kissing Carissa without getting bored the first time he does that She is quite kissable Also snuggly

She likes Keltham Her thoughts are probably lingering on this because of how shes presently kissing him but its true and no doubt theres been at least one agonized meeting over it though somehow no one has reprimanded her maybe because they know that she really really really does not want to be a statue and even if all the other pillars of her motivational structure grew Keltham rot inside them and they havent she will still not betray them Shes heard it said dismissively that the characteristic female fantasy is that there is a powerful man who could hurt you but he doesnt Maybe thats all that it is But right now the way that it is is that she likes Keltham and when he has her in his arms all her plans maintain only the most tenuous of connections to her bobbing up and down in the periphery of her mind like a sailor overboard on the high seas visible for a long time despite being almost immediately beyond rescue 

 and maybe she should troubleshoot that

What are her objectives First to get Keltham to feel attached to her Second to comprehend him fully in order to build the Evil version of dath ilani thought Third stretch goal seduce him to Evil 

The third one seems tricky right now Thats okay Carissas going to be forgiving of herself about that Other people too agree that it seems hard Keltham is still grappling with ideas like that smarter people might take advantage of less smart ones this part of the operation is in exploratory mode right now and thats all right 

The second one also seems tricky right now though more necessary than ever 

Whenever Carissas around Keltham she gets confused about the nature of Evil Its because the version she gave him just fits better into a pathetic human mind In hindsight its obvious that trying to destroy the world might seem Good that Rovagug cultists certainly would be principled believers that the world should be devoured at their own expense And the observable fact about the world that almost everyone ends up Evil makes more sense if Evil is about selfishness or lack of altruism than it does with the understanding that Evil is well Abrogail Thrune Carissa is pretty sure this thought will end up in a transcript for Abrogail Thrune tomorrow so hi Abrogail Thrune please dont turn me into a statue Abrogail Thrune I am suffering in your service very diligently Abrogail Thrune but most people are not Abrogail Thrune Most people are not even weak pale shadows of Abrogail Throne Tyranny slavery pride contracts most people kind of just bumble along being weak and pathetic and Carissa is confused about 1 how any of them make Law and 2 how any of them make Evil Shes not worried about herself personally Shes definitely making progress on Law and she thinks shes made some progress on being genuinely Evil the last two days Shes taking to authority nicely and has lit people on fire when they deserved it and offering to destroy Asmodias soul in a dark sorcerous rite if its not heretical to contemplate was kind of fun though also Carissa wants everyone to go to Hell and not get destroyed in sorcerous rites 

Is that Good If she wants it in a way thats not about what Asmodeus wants thats about the sheer horror of their annihilation its at the very least the product of a broken mind misunderstanding doctrine And yet

It hadnt occurred to Asmodia what they had to be trying to do here But they are going to have to do it or the mountains of spellsilver will go to everyone and Cheliax wont be uniquely advantaged might be disadvantaged even if their current systems for promoting enough Law and Evil to get their children clear of Abaddon and into Hell stop working on a smarter generation of children reformulate that to be less pathetic and broken even if it means it fits less well into her present mind she doesnt wish to err when shes trying to do strategic planning even if the errors are convenient otherwise even if she suspects Asmodeus chose her partially for her heresies Cheliaxs current systems get souls to Asmodeus who wants them Asmodeus has extended this project resources on the assumption it can get him more souls or more useful ones and thats why it ought to do that 

Asmodia is presumably being tortured right now and Carissa hopes shes not useless when she gets back Maybe itll be good for her motivation 

The first goal on the other hand is going great Maillol says the things shed done shouldnt have worked but they did and Keltham likes her and if she only had to accomplish the first goal shed practically have accomplished it already and she could just keep him interested and roll around on a giant mountain of spellsilver 

Maybe 

Keltham hasnt really hurt Carissa In a sense no one has ever really hurt Carissa she talks a good game but she was careful in her old life about which powerful adventurers who could kill her if they were so inclined she climbed up into a Rope Trick with she mostly went for girls because whatever Maillol says they are less inclined to hurt you on average though obviously Abrogail Thrune hi Abrogail Thrune is entitled to do exactly as she pleases with Carissa including turning her into a statue though Carissa really really hopes that she wont do that because Carissa wants to go to Hell and will make herself very useful to Abrogail Thrune there If she gets there Subordinate devils are worth having Much more useful than statues

 anyway Keltham can bite her and claw at her but he hasnt for example even looked at the pokers in the fireplace and he hasnt even asked for tips on the most efficient ways to hurt people without causing damage and unless you count the cursed Bag of Holding as a sexual experience and plausibly Carissa should she hasnt actually been tortured in a sex way and shouldnt have high confidence in how gracefully shell handle it except within the bounds of how well she handles it in other contexts It seems possible shell like Keltham less once shes taught him how and why to really hurt her Its possible that whatever switch will flip in her head and hell be terrifying instead of intriguing and then everything will just suck 

Which would be good practice for Hell if so 

 Carissa thinks that somehow all this thinking is actually making her worse at her job and she should abandon it and go back to not thinking which was working fine kind of 

 so she says Are we supposed to have an in depth conversation about how sex works now or given that your notes were destroyed will we have to have sex in order to recreate the conditions under which you can recreate your notes

Id say stop trying to pressure me into sex but I find that I in fact enjoy being asked and maybe even enjoy getting to say no And I expect I can recall at least some of my questions though probably not in the right order

 noting a cultural difference that while if you dont want me to stop its not a big deal we havent had any interactions which to Chelish understandings involve pressure And I can try to answer questions

Civilization would have it something like if a woman says no a couple of times youre supposed to stop asking and not be visibly not in most preferred state about not having sex You dont lie obviously you just conceal the overt feedback She may guess obviously and if she asked youd just tell her Its not about a deception even a deception by concealment the point is that youre not exerting a direct pressure on subverbal parts of herself by being visibly sad at them

It can be different for a woman pestering a man for sex but only to the extent she has extremely reliable information which basically means information directly from him that hes highly conformant to the masculine gendertrope and that sub gendertrope in particular I would have provided you with that information just now when I told you that I was enjoying being asked and saying no

Keltham is just using Baseline gendertrope as a loanword into Taldane at this point since the corresponding concept in Taldane simply doesnt exist

Civilization is all very structures to make sure that people end up having the power to protect themselves in their sexual relationships and the realistic ability to decide for themselves without that taking a lot of mental work and common knowledge that everyone has in fact been trained to protect themselves that way and passed some tests about it all so that people can be given full responsibility to decide for themselves

So long as youre following those rules in a world where you know everybody else follows those rules it means you dont have to worry about them on their behalf or try to protect them more than they protect themselves or doubt them when they say yes

The typical dath ilani man has a great horror of accidentally harming somebody like that and the rules are there so they can be less scared after somebody says yes to them

 huh We dont have any of those rules and I expect probably do have a higher rate of whatever problems youre trying to solve but if someone asked me for sex repeatedly and I disliked being asked because it was mental work to keep refusing then I would say no and stop asking or something and if I said no and then someone was visibly sad I would not care because Im Evil

There are kinds and kinds of Evil then and I am some but not others I may someday understand what it means to decide everything because you have given yourself to me to see what I make of you I can feel a part of myself yearning for this thing I dont yet understand but I have no interest in learning how to see you being visibly sad and not care

Not encouraging Though adorable But people can be wrong about themselves All right Am I supposed to have that in mind when deciding whether to be visibly sad or am I supposed to just be visibly sad whenever I would around a Chelish person

I think you should err an awful lot on the side of visibility until Ive been on this planet for longer than two days and can guess literally at all what the ass is ever going on without tons and tons of evidence I have been through mental training and its not like it would be easy for you to pressure me into sex I didnt want and then successfully do mental damage to me that way because for example I will in fact say no if you ask me to have sex while Im still shaken up from my first nonsimulated violence Knowing this you know that it is safe to be visibly sad around me that you cannot easily hurt me like that this is a dath ilanis dignity and at deeper layers their friendship

I am not from dath ilan and havent had any specialized evaluation of my capacity to do things without hurting myself but I am not often wrong about how Ill feel about things and youre not going to hurt me by being visibly sad around me or by doing something Ive told you is all right or by doing something I havent told you is all right but havent objected to and I feel upset at the idea theres a world of men terrified of accidentally harming someone when they should be entitled to enjoy themselves with people who arent so easily harmed also seems absolutely brutal on women with fetishes for being forced but maybe thats how you bred all of those out

Im not saying you cant have high levels of your own worlds dignity just that it would be helpful to understand that dignity I can tell its very different And the men arent going around being terrified because Civilization faced the problem head on and solved it

Also fetishes for being forced The Taldane word force can mean several different things its not obvious to Keltham how it translates here

Like its no fun if a man asks them if its all right its only fun if he just grabs them to have his way with them Its got to be like the third fourth most common fetish

Okay see that doesnt sound not dath ilan in the way other things do lots of people enjoy being pursued and I can easily imagine how some would enjoy being pursued harder I mean I doubt its anything like that common but its not antinatural like finding somebody who gets sexually aroused by pain Id put something like 30 probability that we do have that at a layer of perversion above mine and if we do somewhere in Civilization possibly a suburb of Erotown or Nandville there are whole complexes full of women whove registered their preferences for men in sufficient detail that the highest bidders on them can just walk into their houses and haul them into the cuddleroom with pairings near guaranteed to find each other attractive even if nobody talks about it at all

 huh All right maybe those women do fine although in our world that tendency tends to go along with liking pain because its not very realistic if he grabs you and is then very gentle and concerned with your pleasure and its better if its realistic reportedly this isnt actually a fetish of mine I wont object if you jump me without notice sometime but thats because I like you and am a good sport rather than because the possibility of being jumped without notice is specifically thrilling

Inner query if Carissa did like being jumped without being asked would Keltham want to do that sometimes

Inner response loud yes

Welp time to venture another prediction on a model that while it doesnt exactly fit everything sure does apparently seem to fit some things

However says Keltham at least one of the girls in the class and furthermore one of the girls who registered a high response about how surprising shell be does have that fetish

Shit he does think theyre manipulating it Which isnt fair she doesnt see the Law hes using 

I havent asked the other girls what theyre into but given that its one of the most common fetishes probably And if not we could uh put out an ad among wizard students somewhere slightly farther than Ostenso and find you someone if you are intrigued

Oh Im not saying shell be surprising because she has that fetish the surprising thing about her will be something that even someone from Golarion would find shocking but shell also have that fetish which is very common here and isnt surprising at all if youre not me

I mean assuming the basic premise here is true which it hopefully isnt it would be a whole lot easier to nope the shit out of that hypothesis if not you know air traveling machine crash surviving my own True Death and all that

Im sorry I probably shouldnt be talking about this in front of you at all If its true theres definitely nothing you can do about it until Ive figured more things out unless that trope is being specifically subverted It would be a puzzle thrown at a dath ilani not at someone from Golarion Hes probably just alarming her more at this point isnt he This in retrospect must be why the usual convention says that the NPCs in a meta eroLARP eroLARP cant hear you talk about the layer 0 eroLARP until youve made more progress with them

It seems important to get Keltham to explain this second layer of Law that he uses to infer that Pilar was chosen by Cayden Cailean without knowing about Pilar or Cayden Cailean 

Even if theres nothing I can do about it if its important to you and part of what youre using to make predictions about the world then I want to understand it

Keltham considers explaining the concept of an ero LARP much more famous novels deconstructing those ero LARPs and ero LARPs based on novels deconstructing ero LARPs

He considers trying to explain how quantum mechanics is known from experiment and how it in turn implies the many worlds and what the nature of amplitudes led Civilization to realize about realityfluid and how all those many worlds must be embedded into a still larger Reality in which the quantum multiverse itself is multiply instantiated And how having survived an airplane crash there is a single obvious wild thought about what must have happened to him that ending in almost all places he continued on within a remaining and improbable one If he was a Keeper probably Keltham would already know it for it seems like the sort of thing that must be deducible from first principles if it is true at all and also an obvious massive infohazard in ways that Keltham may not have begun to conceive Hes not sure exactly why it will be massively infohazardous but it obviously will be

And now the place where he finds himself has people who arent any plausible equilibrium of selection pressures but happen to exactly fit the complementary shape of his own unsatisfied and unsatisfiable sexuality and theres a research group full of girls roughly his age with himself the sole male among them and an explicit rationalization for why they all want his seed and they all have economicmagic and 3 5 of them have fascinating backstories that even Golarion would find surprising while Nidal invades Cheliax targeting him personally and the godtreaties break down thereby forcing him to relocate to a new bedroom decorated in doompunk with chains attached to the bed

What happens if you perform an evidential update from that and then predict the future

He considers explaining this to somebody who is not going to know at least until tomorrow maybe not even for two whole more days what an evidential update is

Carissa he says truly apologetically you have not in fact ever heard me try to explain any topic that Civilization would consider at all complicated and this is a little complicated I know which concept Id explain first in the sequence of the explanation and I was going to do that concept tomorrow but that sequence goes on for a while

Is it likely to cause some kind of catastrophe before you can get around to explaining it

When the research harem reconvenes maybe Ill try an Augury about what happens if I politely ask everyone who registered themselves as very interesting to stand up and explain their backstories to me each other and the rest of the research group Given the entire premise which I emphasize is still rather less likely than likely that would be the most obvious way to defuse any potential catastrophes if it did not itself cause a catastrophe 

 shit What happened to Broom

Broom went invisible stayed out of the way as best he could and is now in a nicely appointed palace room of his own awaiting a check in from Aspexia Rugatonn

Broom wasnt exactly considered unimportant earlier but now that an attack from Nidal on the site of an Otolmens event has started a war among the gods he rates a few more minutes of her time in case he knows literally anything whatsoever

Carissa has been apprised of this but Carissa who isnt running this operation would not have been apprised of this 

 didnt see him in the pile of bodies The war among the gods thats the kind of thing that maybe qualifies as a giant mess The last one killed fifteen percent of the global population

Not the same tragedy it would be in Civilization he has to keep reminding himself of that until Golarion becomes cached

Keltham pokes her in the ribs harder than he would if Carissa wasnt a masochist Thats for talking about fifteen percent of the global population dying while we were lying in bed

Dath ilani do strive to learn from experience literally at all

Deep elaborate bow the most elaborate she can manage while in bed cuddling him I beg your forgiveness

I guess I do have to ask earlier rather than later under the circumstances if the planet scathing side effects of a godwar are the sort of thing where we should stay dressed in case we suddenly have to evacuate the palace

Our chances of having to suddenly evacuate are probably much higher than usual but from a very low base

Is the fifteen percent thing like definite now that the godwars started or could it maybe just be a small one this time

We dont exactly have lots of examples But last time most of the people who died died because all around the world there were twelve days of really intense wind and rain intense enough to wash out all the crops and uproot most of the trees and so there was no harvest and so they starved and if this one is faster or less rainy I have no idea what makes godwars rainy then maybe almost no onell die The lights arent going to kill anyone

This war has at least my god Asmodeus and Nethys all allied and trying to take out Zon Kuthon but given why Zon Kuthon did it there could be any number of other gods allied with him Well Probably not any Good ones But how does that match up to whatever the last god war was about

I think thats better than the last god war which was I think close to an even split a god called Aroden had decided to make Golarion his divine realm instead of having it in Axis and rule it directly and the gods were very closely divided on this plan and He went ahead when He thought He had just enough support it wasnt worth it to his opponents to fight and then prophecy broke there could never have been a godwar before prophecy broke right Theyd see howd it go and just settle accordingly 

Unless youre about to wreck so much of what a god cares about that theres nothing left for them to negotiate so they try to launch a preemptive strike team at you and when that fails go down fighting

Yeah that does seem to be the other circumstance under which youd have a god war But its hard to imagine Hell have many allies its not like many gods have much common ground with the god whose values are inverted So maybe itll be a quick one The war between Cheliax and Nidal will probably last much longer but is vanishingly unlikely to oblige us to evacuate

Heh So nothing Civilization would consider scalable weaponry then Where scalable weaponry is weaponry that you can go on making more destructive if for some reason it needs to be even more destructive

Nobody plays realistic Alien Invasion Rehearsals Theyd be too short and depressing

Carissa feels a quiet chill even though this isnt new information they knew dath ilan had vastly superior weaponry because it has vastly superior everything Nothing like that Theres a place in Garund where theres a wasteland for hundreds of miles because two ninth circle wizards fought there but it isnt actually dangerous to travel through its just that magic behaves weirdly and plants mostly dont grow Theres opening something like the Worldwound but Nidal and Cheliax are both Lawful and committed to not doing that and anyway its very very difficult and still doesnt just straightforwardly scale up

 I would know I think if there were something that a reasonable number of people knew about or that had ever in history been used because people at the Worldwound pay a lot of attention to our options however speculative for closing it There could of course be secret things 

 and one time some people crashed a moon into the planet so uh theres that I guess

Small moon Or are we talking like a couple of billion years ago

Small moon It was ten thousand years ago and it wouldve ended life on the planet if not for divine intervention of various stripes it did annihilate both the civilization that dropped it and the one they were fighting with There was no sun for many many years but with magic small populations can limp along without We call it the Age of Darkness there is a remaining moon and I wouldnt exactly put it past Nidal if theyre losing everything but the Crown and Church will have thought of this

 its started to feel like somebody is recounting a colorful fascinating backstory for atmosphere rather than something that actually happened which potentially indicates that hes under enough internal stress to produce derealization the whole point of history is that it actually happened Civilization may have hidden much of it but for what remains in the recent and far more distant past the whole point is that its not just another story

Yeah thats around as much damage as Civilization could do to a planet and they might need a few months of lead time to scale it that far Well Its as much damage as they could do using methods that people like me are allowed to know about but But why talk about that or think about it if youre not a Keeper Except there are no Keepers here out of dath ilan just Keltham now

I think I should stop talking about this Carissa at least for the night I may not be able to simultaneously handle the aftermath of nonsimulated violence and also thinking about what my being here may have set off

 makes sense Im sorry Did you have sex questions that are very narrow in scope and wont get into world history at all

Well at least ones I dont expect to interact much with world history But we should first do some manner of snuggly thing no not sex to get my brain out of its current place

Does testing out the chains count as sex

Well so long as youre not expecting too much I suppose whatever happens to you will happen I am trying to hear and absorb what youre saying literally at all and if Ive managed to do that correctly literally at all I do grasp thats the point of the chains

In a black stone room in a black stone skyscraper in the doompunk city of Dis a contract devil is reading case law as one does 

Waking up from dying is not exactly like waking up from falling asleep Your memory isnt of a muzzy period that trails off and blurs into notness as you fall half asleep and then all asleep Dying is abrupt at least if you do it the way Asmodia did hearing a Security alert to cast resistances she doesnt have no useful spells prepared at all and then being swarmed by shadows moments after shed reached her self defense dagger Its very clear where your last lifes memory ends

Coming out of it is something like being drowning in the water and then clawing yourself onto shore and coughing out that water and then having just finished doing that Only without the whole part where you almost drowned made it to shore and coughed out that water just the part where youd finished

Asmodia wakes up

It doesnt take her very long at all to figure out why shes naked in a black stone room in front of a contract devil she met very recently

Her internal screaming is very very very loud but its all internal of course

 well that was fast he says turning to look at her half annoyed and half amused Eventful day hmmm Stay there and shut up until Im at a good stopping place And he returns to his book

Asmodia stays there and shuts up

The more time he reads the better

Theyll probably raise her

Right he says brightly when hes finished the page hes writing and reshelved the books on the enormous bookshelves paneling the wall behind him Well theyll probably raise you which makes trying to get any actual training done a waste of time but they might take their time about it Whats your guess for how long

The thought crosses Asmodias mind to lie but only very briefly If she was found out it might be a very poor start to her stay in Hell

It my priority depends on whether the shadows got Keltham too or if they can raise him theres a chance Ill be a high priority I dont know what that chance is do you know whats happening in Cheliax right now in the place I died

You can lie if youd like I dont mind he says cheerfully If I minded I would simply make the punishment more fun until I was once again indifferent about whether you lie You have to preserve your patience if you do a lot of training new petitioners I think we are getting the gossip ahead of everyone who isnt officially in line for it what with you having come straight to me good girl by the way but well know soon from whether Dis has soldiers in the streets whether theres a broader fight or a one off bit of nonsense Conspiratorially I think there might be a broader fight

He can read her mind then I was reading a math book in my bedroom when I heard a Security alert telling me to resist negative energy which I cant do and then shadows attacked me and I died pretty quickly I dont know why that place was swarmed with shadows except obviously that they would have been after 

Sir are you authorized to know about Keltham and his project I do not have any grasp of that but if you are reading my mind you know I am being sincere when I say that I dont know whether Hell has cleared yourself to know about it If he can see her mind then he knows that she is being very sincere very humble and only trying to serve Asmodeuss purposes and interests when she thinks about how she is trying not to think about thoughts that may be classified information

You know he says its such a shame how you want to be eaten by daemons I think youd make a quite satisfactory contract devil yourself once youd had training A real waste Which means of course itll be more expensive for you to get what you want since youre trying to buy something quite valuable away from those who lay claim to it Did you ever consider being totally worthless Of course then I suppose youd have nothing with which to buy even your very worthless place keeping the floors shiny He gestures and yes theres a face there moving very subtly in the glossy black tile distorted like its far away and underwater Screaming obviously 

I am authorized to know the business of anyone I own if that means I just got a promotion so be it and if someone thinks I am not suited to the promotion and tries to kill me so be that too It would be a great sickness in the heart of Hell were it ever correct for you to withhold something from me If I feared this hypothetical promotion I might choose to sell you off right away without asking but that would be my choice not yours Do you understand

Yes The shadows were obviously after Keltham who if he knows anything like what he thinks he knows and I think he does is potentially the greatest weapon and asset that Cheliax has Keltham knows Law math standing behind things underneath the world underneath thoughts ideas that could obviously be used to create weapons if somebody wanted but he somehow doesnt think like that

Asmodia wonders why there might be a broader fight what sort of broader fight but doesnt have the temerity to ask well she thought it so he knows it but she hadnt meant to do that to ask

Fascinating he says Write down everything youve learned since you heard of Keltham while its fresh The quill on the left draws your blood you may do a draft in ink first if youd like which would be the quill on the right The potions on the third shelf help clarify the memory theyll burn your tongue out so if you have anything to say you may as well say it now

Thats pretty tame for Hell she cant stop herself from thinking if that was all there was to Hell it wouldnt be that bad Its a really stupid thought and she already knows that he has an unending depth of torments vastly worse she does not need to be told or shown that part

If theres anything I should prioritize in case I get Raised almost immediately sir Whether you mean me to write down math and ideas I learned from Keltham or also all the strange things happening around him like Ione getting book powers from Nethys and Pilar getting oracled by Cayden Cailean and the Queen suddenly deciding that Carissa Sevar is worth sleeping with and all of that sort of stuff

Why the writing works better in her blood if its possible to draft in ink she does not need or want that answered it isnt meant as a defiance her brain just wonders that sort of thing and she knows it isnt needful for her to know it Why she wouldnt just be told to take the third shelf potion right away

The devil has been only half attending to her flitting around getting more books off the shelves but at that he stops 

Carissa Sevar he says Tell me more

Who the FUCK is Sevar actually EVERYTHING SHE JUST SAID and the FIRST THING he wants to hear about is SEVAR

Keltham has discovered the very strange pleasure of snuggling somebody who cant snuggle back You wouldnt think this would make any sense and yet theres a strange you know hes not even going to analyze hes just going to wrap his limbs around Sevar while she cant wrap back and enjoy that for some reason

Eventually his brain pings him with an impending boredom warning because he is still unfortunately a dath ilani and this activity is not one of vast complexity He can either escalate it down a path where hes not quite sure what is or isnt sex or he can restart the conversation from pre forbidden topic Keltham opts for the latter

Ready to be talked with while you cant escape Keltham says

Mmhmm

So Ive got smaller questions subquestions Like how when you told me that youd made yourself prettier I felt this weird sense of both ownership of your appearance or something and a worry that you thought you werent already attractive for me like my brain thinks Im now the center of your decision process 

I think its all part of a larger question that I think is a common thread running through my notes that got lost but maybe you want to start with a smaller question first

 yeah no I think theres probably a larger thing there So some people just like hitting people in the bedroom and thats fine but it seemed likely once you mentioned you were growing romantic feelings that you actually want an overall romantic relationship dynamic thats built the same way where you have power and ownership and make decisions where my sexuality is for you and is yours to shape and enjoy and make demands of And so I would predict youd want lots of things in that sphere

Keltham takes a deep breath

So youve now ever been partially exposed to snippets from the basics of the basics of childhood training for dath ilani you dont have zero idea of how we see reality Were used to knowing things legibly Including places where Golarion might have the idea that its important for people to obscure things because youve built a weird not quite Lawful thing which requires illegibility to work

Like bargaining the way you first described how somebody would do that for my shirt You can imagine a non dath ilani with a shirt thinking oh no I must conceal that the true value of my shirt to me is just a million gold pieces if they think its really five million I can get a higher price if they know its one million they can just give me an ultimatum to take one million one hundred thousand take it or leave it A dath ilani wouldnt be scared of things becoming legible because they have more Lawful approaches that dont disadvantage them in the presence of that legibility they know the right thing to do is refuse unfair but mutually beneficial trades with very high probability The real value they put on their shirt isnt a secret for them the way its a secret for somebody bargaining the usual way for Golarion

I mean if they were playing by Golarions rules they might still try to make the other person think it was five million if that was the game If it wasnt anything serious like negotiations with Cheliax I could see myself playing the bargaining game the illegible way if that saved me time explaining things Id try to have fun with it even though I doubt Id be very good at it on the first try But Id have a legible game to fall back on if the illegible game blows up or isnt going my way

If youre used to that being the way things are trying to play an illegible game with no known legible Law underlying it feels like walking on wet ice you dont have a lot of ice Feels unstable like youre about to put your foot down wrong and fall over any second As kids they train us to keep going anyways and parse the universe as we run through it but that doesnt make illegibility feel safe

Theres places even so where Civilization would give somebody a hug and tell them it was okay to not be totally legible right away A mother who just gave birth to a child doesnt need to immediately put a value in unskilled labor hours on her babys life how much shed pay to avert a 01 chance of various bad things happening any of that Anybody who burst in and started quizzing her about that would be ejected from the maternity hospital and probably from most of the cities in Civilization

But when Civilization gives someone a hug and tells them its okay not to make up numbers today what that relies on very crucially is the expectation that the numbers the mom isnt making up and doesnt know to herself are roughly correct numbers in the sense of leading to roughly the same decisions as better numbers would The reason we give a hug of its okay not to be legible today to the mom who just gave birth is that if she did make up numbers about the value of her babys life to her theyd be more like four million labor hours than four labor hours Shes not going to frantically drop her baby in order to save a water glass from falling and breaking If you expected her to get decisions like that wrong youd tell her to make up legible numbers immediately and run them past somebody else

Someone tells me that shes given herself to me to do with as I want and if Id grown up in Golarion wed probably both be fine from there But in reality Im pretty sure there would be some things I could do that were really not what you had in mind like like taking that sharp thing 3 vicious nasty bigsword and killing you with it and then after youre brought back I just kill you again and tell Cheliax not to bring you back that time That is probably really not what you had in mind and just to be very clear it is not what I had in mind either And you cant spell out things like that for me my model predicts you replying because then its you telling me what I cant do and contrary to the nature of this thing the way it needs to be In this case theres no problem right because it so happens that I dont want to do that to you my brain is generating the correct answer despite it being illegal to tell me an underlying Law But that also means Im playing an illegible game that has no known legible game behind it and I feel like Im walking around on wet ice every time I try to think about moving forward with it because I did not grow up in Golarion and I am not confident that the numbers Im not making up are roughly correct ones

Done

Actually if that specific thing happens shell be so fucking promoted in Hell but theres no way to oh wait yes there is 

I contemplated whether you might do that and decided if you did I would have an incredibly lucrative storytelling gig in Hell telling people about the fascinating very brief experience of trying to explain sadism to an alien from another world

 uh I realize that was just an example

 this feels like some strange reflection of a dath ilanis dignity where you cant possibly offend them in various ways without making a deliberate and adversarial effort about it Except its about you being invincible not something that can be truly hurt by anything something like that

Carissa finds herself noticing that she shouldnt lie about how her sexuality works because she has no idea what the Second Law of inferring peoples sexualities does She assumed Keltham noticed she was faking earlier through training she could learn to subvert but if hes using the Second Law then the only way out is truth not necessarily her truth but real truth the only thing that will have the right truth properties on the Shadow Plane Of what did he call them tropes

 part of Chelish dignity is definitely that you only offer deals if you genuinely mean them that youre not relying on any altruism or mercy of the other person that was not specified up front In practice if you like the sort of things I like that kind of means you have to be awfully invincible Or mostly I slept with people at the Worldwound where the treaty proscribed them killing or permanently disabling or kidnapping me and that was enough 

I dont think the core thing that is important to me is being invincible I think the core thing that is important to me is not being foolish and if I assumed there was some safety where there wasnt then that was foolish especially across a species gap so I had to assume there might be none and its very satisfying to be able to assume that and another part of it is that something very important to me is being safe I think part of why I like being hit is that one way of being safe right is to never have bad things happen to you but another is to never have bad things be bad for you to transmute them all through arousal and the admiration of others and sheer determination into something that youre good at and prized for I feel safer when someone is hitting me than I ever feel otherwise because I know I can handle something I didnt previously know I could You could drive a sword through me no one would stop you but Im safe even if you do so Im not scared I dont know if Im making sense Shes not lying though

Ill try trusting you about it then he says in almost a whisper feeling rather scared himself Until you tell me to stop He doesnt say it aloud its supposed to be illegible

HOW is Sevar DOING that Abrogail has repeatedly glanced over at the transcript reading every few steps as the quill writes them and Abrogail cant understand anything about how Sevar figured out how to say exactly what she said Maybe itll come clear once she gets the full transcript with Sevars thoughts but Abrogail somehow doubts it 

We are in the middle of a war hisses Aspexia Rugatonn Asmodeus is in the middle of a war Pay attention

I am The war is predictable

Carissa cant think of anything to say thatd possibly improve on that outcome so she just lets all her delight show on her face 

Im about ready to sleep Want me to let you out of 

See if I wasnt this exhausted Id have noticed faster that Im not supposed to ask you that But if Ive got to decide then I need additional information right thats why my brain doesnt want to decide right away are there likely to be any Carissa needs a toilet first consequences if I decide to try falling asleep snuggling you like this If a more experienced thing I am would know to tell you to give me other information first tell me those questions

I think someone more experienced would say it as Im going to go to sleep snuggling you like this but Ill entertain arguments I should let you out for a little while first I should in fact probably check out the fancy palace baths

Keltham has an alternate thought Is it a real impulse something he actually wants out of his true self Or his brain autocompleting the thing that a person like him would do based on its early primitive pattern prediction

 probably a real impulse Keltham isnt sure but if hes not sure thats reason enough

Should you now Well Ill snuggle you for a bit longer since I feel like doing that and then possibly Ill let you out But no promises

Tiny happy Carissa sound

The top priority on the Raise Deads is getting everyone who is themselves a fifth circle or higher cleric of Asmodeus raised by morning so they can join in on the Raise Deads themselves There are not usually quite this many dead clerics of Asmodeus but theyre getting through it burning diamonds at a pace everyone knows that even the richest treasury in all Golarion cant keep up for very long but longer than Nidal probably They have some other people nearby casting Restoration on the newly raised clerics to fix the problem where they come back weaker Its a nice little assembly line operation 

Someone from Palace Security is on hand for Maillols resurrection They have a briefing for him Its a pretty long briefing considering hes been dead for almost five hours now

Its not the first time Ferrer Maillol has been raised He doesnt remember anything of Hell hes a priest of Asmodeus not a sold soul who bypasses sorting and while his god could perhaps trouble Himself to take Maillol directly Asmodeus of course has never shown that much solicitude Maillol is someone wholl predictably be raised even with prophecy broken he has never seen the Boneyard even briefly

His last memories say that somebody hit him with a Suffocation spell a caster powerful enough that Maillol went unconscious almost immediately and unconscious is not a good place to be in the middle of a Nidal assault even if the spell doesnt just kill you Maillol didnt particularly expect to survive to be clear and burned all his negative channelings almost immediately he wasnt expecting combat that day and hadnt requested spells accordingly

Maillol lives and pulls himself together fast enough you might not notice it and requests a situation update

Our Lord is at war with Zon Kuthon the briefing begins and Cheliax is at war with Nidal Keltham is alive Sevar is alive and has project command though she delegated most project decisions to you anticipating your immediate return Otolmens oracle is alive Keltham Sevar and Otolmens oracle have been relocated to the palace on Her Majestys orders Sevar is presently chained up in Kelthams bed having had a conversation with him in which she told him that what he desires is a romantic relationship in which she belongs to him he worried she did not mean he could murder her she insisted she did mean that and he decided to trust her and try doing whatever he wants which seems to be cuddling Project casualties are in your briefing notes theyre in line for resurrection were seeing high casualties on the border so those resurrections may be slow at their present prioritization

Pilar the oracle of Cayden Cailean somehow accompanied Keltham to his spell testing and out of the villa for the summons and then took a sword for him shes higher priority for resurrection because were both worried we might lose her shes in Elysium and because we need to ask her what the fuck happened Asmodia is also dead confirmed in Hell lower priority Ione is not conscious and may not given the vision was likely from Nethys recover consciousness The villa has just been determined clear of hostiles and traps and not yet evaluated for Kuthite magic items for divination or espionage Keltham is suspicious about the destruction of his notes which happened when the Kuthites swarmed the villa and about the fact that the invasion was obviously timed to his stepping outside the villa and yet the invaders didnt seem to immediately know where he was We have no explanation for this Hes requested we ensure there are no secret Kuthites on staff were pretty damn sure obviously but if theres anyone who could plausibly have evaded recent evaluation haul them in Hes also suspicious that Security didnt teleport him out we determined that staff member used his Teleports earlier in the day fetching requisitions from a supply depot in Corentyn and that despite this he was selected to accompany Keltham out of the villa because he passed muster to Detect Anxieties and Detect Desires when most didnt but if anything about that seems odd to you we can raise his priority for resurrection as well or if he refuses it contact his owner in Hell

Our Lord is at war with Zon Kuthon would be harder to understand as a statement with import clearly distinct from Cheliax is at war with Nidal if there were not a window inside the room Maillol now occupies from which you can see a bit of the darkest of night sky flickering in a way that if history is true it hasnt done in the hundred years since Aroden died and the Worldwound opened

Maillol wants to believe that this is literally the worst that a project disaster can possibly possibly get

He is afraid that it is not

Have we considered the possibility that this project is in fact cursed directly by Pharasma Herself with all of Her malice and should be shut down entirely before we find out what happens to it tomorrow says Maillol

 he doesnt actually But he thinks it very loudly

What he says instead is I need explicit confirmation that Aspexia Rugatonn knows that Carissa Sevar is sharing a building with the Queen

In the depths of the center of the Palace in Egorian there is a chamber that sees unfortunately frequent use The queen sits on a stepped dais high enough that her own head will not be below that of the crouching form of Gorthoklek the pit fiend which even with Gorthoklek crouching requires quite the high dais Across from Gorthoklek also stands Contessa Lrilatha in full and deadly panoply

Before the dais stands one other

The most important purpose of this chamber is to when it becomes necessary hold an intervention

You Abrogail Thrune declares coldy imperiously a voice like a twisting dagger are a greater disappointment to me than perhaps any other being or happening in my life

The feeling is mutual says one of the three entities in Cheliax who would dare say such a thing

I can remember as though it were yesterday my excitement when I learned that Asmodeus had sent me my own personal erinyes to tempt me and corrupt me What poisonous words does she now whisper in my ears Restrain my cruelty Restrain my lust I must control my desires and not let my desires control me I have been assigned my own personal black winged monk of Irori

Irori is Lawful Neutral observes the same entity who spoke before Contessa Lrilatha Asmodeus is Lawful Evil Need I spell out in greater detail what the two have in common Imagine my own disappointment when hoping I had been assigned an eager pupil to corrupt further I found myself instead tasked to restrain an incipient drow queen

Drow queen What a tempting thought They one hears are allowed to have fun

Aspexia Rugatonn speaks then weary dry from where she stands before the dais facing down the Queen with the other two sensible beings in Cheliax You are allowed to have fun You are allowed to have other fun Find different fun

I dont want different fun I want to turn Sevar into a statue I really really want to turn Sevar into a statue

I really really want to dissolve you in acid but you dont hear me being a whinecomplainbitch about it This word of Infernal now appears as a loanword in the Chelish dialect of Taldane

I want to petrify her slowly so that she can feel it happening and scream with all of her heart and all of her soul while its happening and release all of that terror and tension and everything inside her and I want to kiss her gently while shes turning to stone and screaming Shes just so scared and I so rarely meet anyone whos that scared well anyone interesting to me whos that scared of me personally doing something that it would interest me to do to them

Even hunched over with its wings folded the black figure is taller than a man standing on another mans shoulders I expect that our Lord would be most extremely displeased rumbles Gorthoklek

I would of course unpetrify her immediately afterwards and swear then never to do that to her in truth unless she had betrayed the House of Thrune knowingly deliberately and unambiguously

Gorthoklek and Contessa Lrilatha both pass their Bluff checks against the queen Aspexia Rugatonn who is not specialized in Splendour in quite the same way does not The brief break in the rooms atmosphere is therefore however finely noticeable

What says Abrogail Did you actually believe that I would actually bury her Really Really After having known me this long you still think I would do that

Yes say three of the four most powerful beings in Cheliax in unison

Perhaps I would if Asmodeus had not singled her out and if she were not performing vital work for Cheliax But that being so do you truly believe I would affront Asmodeuss purpose and interests so when I could have most of the fun I wanted without the cost to Hell You should know given the consequences to me and how those have not yet been invoked that I have never once betrayed Asmodeus in the depths of my own heart

The trouble is what the depths of your own heart seem to define as a betrayal of Asmodeus rumbles Gorthoklek The depths of your own heart seem astonishingly permissive about it

Oh How misfortunate The devil negotiating my pact on behalf of Asmodeus should have defined that term more carefully

Mortal humans being what they are one would have expected this clause of the contract to come into force within days of the pact being signed and possibly the first minute No matter how lax or unspoken the definition no matter how the mortal drove themselves half mad trying to avoid that it should have triggered anyways The resulting penalty clauses do not nullify the compact but produce a less stringent interpretation of Hells side and a more stringent interpretation of Abrogail Thrunes

Given that it hasnt triggered the devil who negotiated that compact is not having a good century It isnt that Asmodeus hasnt benefited from the pact or that Asmodeus isnt receiving enough of a share of the gains or even that He is displeased with the results its the principle of the thing

Abrogail Thrune has never once spoken aloud what it meant to her when she signed her compact to not betray Asmodeus in the depths of her own heart lest anyone use that knowledge against her It is simply this she gets to have her fun and Asmodeus gets to have His

You know as well as I do that it would be good for her says Abrogail Thrune It would be so so good for her

We are not here to do what is good for Sevar says Aspexia Rugatonn We were explicitly instructed not to be proactive about her correction

You were I was not Asmodeus cannot have failed to predict that she would catch my interest

He most certainly can have failed to predict it He can have failed to predict that Hells exact wording would leave you a loophole and a rather arguable loophole at that Our Lord has other things on His mind and cannot devote all of His attention to Cheliax Complications like these which require more of His attention are already injuries and expenses to Him And now of all times He is gravely distracted and may not see what is happening here at all

For all her Splendour bonuses Abrogail cant compete with Aspexia for sternness but neither is she that easily swayed from her desires You may recall that when I was negotiating with your Lords agent to take this throne in the first place there is a specific clause I added to the effect that His high priests would not tell me to never have any fun Keep to your Lords bargain Aspexia

Operative word never Aspexia says sharply Ive accepted you turning good Asmodeans into statues and burying them because most souls are of little importance to our Lord because there could be a discipline problem otherwise among those who truly look forward to Hell You may continue to have that fun in the future This soul is of importance to our Lord and to your country of Cheliax and to our Lords longer purposes in Golarion Otolmens has appointed an oracle The gods are at war You need to stop introducing complications

Unfortunately as I do now admit I did not realize on first meeting Sevar the effect my threat would have on her and that I do worry may be a complication The transcripts of her thoughts show that despite my attempted reassurance she continues to be distracted by thoughts of me doing terrifying things to her So now I have to actually do them to her Slowly Its the only way to undo my own past folly

Hardly the only way observes the most actually intelligent entity in the room in a low grumbling growl though this level of Intelligence is not required to see the obvious You could swear to Sevar the same oath without first pretending to turn her into a statue

But then I would never get to slowly petrify her

Why have our existences become this wonders Contessa Lrilatha on a more private channel How did we offend our Lord Will we ever be allowed to return to Hell

Gorthoklek replies with a brief proverb in Infernal It carries with it the sense of Hell is other people of This is Hell nor are we out of it of Hell is not a place but a philosophy but the literal Infernal is simply Hell is the destruction of hope

Time doesnt always pass in the same rate in Chaotic planes Especially if the local Power in charge wills otherwise Cayden Cailean is otherwise occupied fighting Zon Kuthon but has still His local co conspirators and His plans laid in advance

Pilar Pineda has been in Elysium longer than Hell thinks Not nearly long enough to get the full tour but enough to be shown around a little appropriately attired and appropriately treated to see massive crystal waterfalls in which glasslike material flows slowly down from what look like leagues and leagues up to sleep briefly but refreshingly in a warm cavern lit by glowing edible moss to meet interesting people and be mistreated by them in interesting ways

Long enough to be told what Elysium believes about what Hell really is how Hell really works and have it sworn to her in the name of Good and Chaos that theyre telling the truth to the best of their own knowledge Theyre not Lawful yes but it doesnt mean theyre all liars all the time There are beings with spell like abilities here to rival great wizards and one shows Pilar a glimpse of Hell as it really is

To be clear Pilar hasnt been here that long this tour is being done in something of a rush

Keltham wakes to light just beginning to filter in through the bedroom window He is not used to sleeping through any more light than that and what with all the distractions didnt even close the curtains before falling asleep cuddling a chained up Carissa

Oh

He can sleep on the same surface and even in the same poorly designed bed as someone else Well He can do that with Carissa he doesnt particularly like the thought of doing it with anyone else that he currently knows

Its raining outside moderately windy Its not possible to see underneath the clouds if the sky is doing anything weird

Keltham starts to get the key how is that a key he didnt want to interrupt sexytimes to ask Carissa this last night but you can literally just look at it and see how it must fit into the lock Why couldnt you just look at the shape and remember it and then make another key like that if youd trained yourself a bit on fast memorization Golarion really doesnt make much sense well maybe only sexy keys for bed chains are like this because the person is chained up and it doesnt matter if they can remember the keys shape

Hes carefully unlocking the keys before it occurs to him to wonder whether he actually wants to Carissa let out after a few moments he concludes that he doesnt want to do more well maybe he would if he thought of things to do but if he wasnt pushing himself into things 

Keltham realizes hes being dumb he knows how to think better than this in familiar domains knows that the Way there is not to question your ordinary wants so much except on rare special occasions of deliberate meta He felt like letting Carissa out of the chains so hes going to do that and not trip over questioning the impulse If he made the wrong decision somehow by acting on that impulse hell find out and his brain will update its impulses Besides if he wants Carissa back in the chains he can always put her back in them later

A strange wash of warmth at that final thought unfamiliar but becoming quickly less so

Shes a sounder sleeper but wakes up at him attempting this flinches at first and tugs at the chains before she realizes 

Oh hey Good morning

Hes pretty sure that what she just said was good morning so the Taldane words are starting to settle in a little

Greet the day Keltham replies cheerfully in Baseline before his brain helpfully thinks of the rainy weather outside and that it might betoken an impending genre shift to Postapocalyptic and while Keltham does inwardly tell his brain to screw off this is not a perfect inner telling

Chain removal continues

Oh do they no longer have a language in common ugh She will call a servant about that once shes unchained if he doesnt seem to have other plans

Keltham will perform the gestures for Comprehend Languages where Carissa can see them he hasnt prayed for spells yet so he might as well use this one He can understand her now if not speak to her

Keltham doesnt think until afterwards that maybe energy is more expensive to his god than usual right now well hell see if he gets any spells period then

Chains be gone

If you dont want to wait for me to prepare Share Language we can ask the staff here for it Carissa says once hes cast Comprehend Languages You have a call bell right next to the door

Sure hell try Taldane with yet another different set of hard to detect connotations being rapidly overridden by actual familiarity He goes to tap the call bell

A uniformed person shows up in about fifteen seconds How can I help you sir

Eat chair Share Language Taldane Keltham says in attempted Taldane

Its pretty easy to figure out that eat chair was supposed to be cast magic

Yeah all right Tap 

Thank you Keltham says in Taldane and tries running through some words in his mind Its harder to read the faint connotations than it was yesterday Share Language doesnt want to override knowledge that you already have Keltham has to focus hard on the internal probes and use some dath ilani techniques for hunting down subtle connotations that words and concepts have to you

Lawful is obsessing over your citys regulations and fretting over whether youre conforming enough to all of them Chaos is insanity Good is something put firmly underneath a sense of superiority thats alien to dath ilan Evil is being mean to people and not in a sexually sadistic way either

Keltham makes a note not to trust this particular person with anything if he can avoid it Actually he should check 

Asmodeus doesnt return anything nor Zon Kuthon Somehow the spell knows that these are individual things rather than general concepts no matter how much a dath ilani would say that no such qualitative difference exists and isnt transferring them over as Shared Language

Keltham supposes that would have been an overly easy way of identifying traitors at least those at or above second circle wizardry no thats trope based thinking and it is very far from certain that mode of thinking binds to reality here at all so he needs to at least firmly label every use of it in an inference step and then compute everything the other way too If this technique is not forbidden to work by tropes Keltham should be creative about making this method work or just literally continue at all to think about how to make it work

Pain Keltham cant get a read on it he has a Baseline concept that the Taldane word maps onto almost exactly Keltham already knows what this word means This sort of outcome is presumably the reason why Golarion folks dont think of this as a standard probe to use on each other

Dath ilani however do not have a single commonly used concept that corresponds exactly to the connotations and meanings of the Taldane word torture and Keltham can get something of a read on that torture sounds awfulscary rather than desirable

Okay probably not a Kuthite traitor then to the extent this method works at all

 The Baseline compound phrase that refers by convention to deliberately inflicting extreme amounts of pain carries primarily the connotation of overly large negative payoffs in decision matrices and edgelord thought experiments devised by teenage males not the idea that you can obtain information or obedience that way

From the perspective of anybody watching Keltham just said Thank you closed the door and then shut his eyes and stood motionless for about a minute

Carissa is concerned But she has nothing productive to do with the concern and isnt exactly going to interrupt him She brushes her hair and pulls her spellbook out of extradimensional space instead 

Keltham finishes thinking and turns around in time to catch this

Wait have you had a hammerspace this whole time

 Lit Dont bother tracking facts about carrying in Baseline translated to a Taldane term for a pocket dimension

Its a first circle spell to hide your spellbook in another plane It only works on spellbooks I separately have been loaned a Bag of Holding which is more of a standard instance of that thing if you want to poke it

Literally only spellbooks and how is that a thing the spell can tell and what counts as a spellbook and can you write a spell over the outside of a luggage and pack the whole thing away are some of the questions that leap instantaneously to mind but they are not urgent ones I sure will want a Bag of Holding once I have anything to hold in it

Do you need or for that matter want a separate room so you can prepare spells And I also need if its possible a space where I can sometimes be where other people wont be there without knocking if this ends up our shared bedroom

Only spellbooks because this is a hyperspecialized version of a more general third circle spell which a research team at the Worldwound shaved down to first by making it incredibly specific It has to be the spellbook you prepared the first circle spell out of it has to be magically unique or you might get someone elses spellbook with the exact same spells written in it the weight limit is what a Mage Hand can lift and non magical notes or writing dont tend to come back when you summon it back You can use the third circle version if you dont like those downsides 

I think this is meant to be your bedroom and you can request me a separate one if you want space thats not shared even if youre generally going to want me in yours

Hope we can at some point get to a situation with three rooms instead of two but given the Security situation I can live with it temporarily Do you need to formally report in to Security about last night before spending a lot more time with me do you prefer to prepare spells before you do anything else in a day do you desire breakfast above and before all other things 

My priority is you Keltham But I guess youve got spells to pray for and so Ill probably by default report to Security and prepare mine while youre doing that

Iones list of spells got burned so I figured especially given what happened yesterday Id ask my god to pick whatever in which case praying wont take long if I get a busy signal and have to figure out my own spells for a new request it might take longer I suppose

right I have no idea if the godwar affects prayer We could ask whether the Asmodean clerics here are getting spells normally but thatd only tell us so much because Asmodeus is a much bigger and more powerful god

Ill just try it now Keltham who has some alien mental training involving task switching and calm states via biofeedback and also lacks preconceptions about how fast sacred rites should take shifts his thoughts into a more meditative and contemplative mode The Taldane word prayer means more to him than it did yesterday theres a novel concept inside Keltham for its connotations to translate onto

Keltham remembers what he saw in Early Judgement and thinks about his desire to engage in mutually beneficial interaction with the God of Coordination the god who runs the afterlife of golden gondolas that are sold and not given away because money symbolizes mutual benefit that spreads out beyond two people bartering directly and that is what binds people helping each other into a Civilization even of many life forms Whatever spells his god thinks he should have today to serve that goal and make skyscrapers in Golarion those are the spells Keltham wants

Abadar is a busy b very confused about how His attempts to help the strange squirrel via spell choice have been playing out so far and c feeling somewhat more relaxed about His initial attempt to open trade with the squirrel in a way nonharmful to the squirrels own interests now that the consequences will include the downfall of Zon Kuthon If the squirrel is Good which it might possibly be to some degree itll probably feel sad about how this whole business ended up helping Cheliax but having also helped cause the downfall of Zon Kuthon should make up for a lot relative to what a Good squirrels interests probably are And if the squirrel isnt Good at all the squirrel is even less likely in those branches to regret having ever tried to trade with Abadar

But most importantly Abadar is busy Call again later

No reply at all Ill try picking out my own spells and praying again but thatll take some time to think We should request a room for you so you can prepare spells there I guess Im not sure how my brain will respond to you being quietly in the room preparing spells and I dont want to unnecessarily fight my brain about anything right now

Very reasonable I will go report to Security and can convey that request on my way

Make it so Carissa

She curtseys and off she goes 

Dawn has come and Asmodean priests receive their spells One soul stands near the top of the new priority list If they dont act soon they might not get her back if its not already too late

Pilar Pineda wakes in the dawn light of Elysium still immersed in the pool of glowing slimes where she was resting that night It seems that she is no longer chained no longer bears those marks that tell Elysians how to mistreat her She is as naked now as when she first appeared here though the pool slimes would be protecting her modesty if Asmodean wizard students were allowed to retain any

Standing before her is the bizarre brightly colored un reality resembling form of Cayden Caileans herald Delegate Its not clear what she is in many senses just that she or is it She obeys or as the locals would have it works with Cayden Cailean

Pilar knows even before She speaks what She will say

Theyll call you very soon says She to Pilar Are you still sure you want to go back

Yes I am sure Pilar says firmly And if its in any way possible I dont want to come here next time Even if I cant get Maledicted in time dont take me here again just let me get my proper trial from Pharasma I belong in Hell And yes I know that when Im in Hell Ill many times wish I was here But Im actually Lawful Evil and this was a lovely place to visit but its not where I belong

The strange being nods Her head Okay

Pilar was expecting more of an argument Okay she repeats

An it harm none other do as ye will It may not be the whole of the Law but it sure is a great big part of Chaotic Good Were not going to keep you here if you say youd rather be somewhere else

From far away Pilar hears the call Yes she answers with her mind with her soul and a majority if not the absolute entirety of her heart Yes I want to go back To serve Asmodeus in Golarion and then in Hell

And she feels herself start to fade

Shes fading really very slowly for some reason and seems to basically be still here

Time is running super fast for us right now relative to Golarion says the strange being I am willing that it be so Raise Dead takes a minute to cast and it turns out theres a few more things you need to hear before you go

Is this where you spring some sort of Chaotic Good trap on me Pilar says suspiciously

No Its where I tell you that Cayden Cailean wont be able to take you if you die for real He was only able to get away with this because you were going to go back and Cayden Cailean knew that Youre right Lawful Evil to Chaotic Good is something of a stretch We could arrange a visit but we cant offer you citizenship not really

Pilar now has additional questions Wait if I could never stay here in the first place why did you keep asking me if I really wanted to go back to Golarion and go on to Hell why send me on this whole tour to convince me to say no to the Raise Dead 

The strange being laughs Her strange high pitched cheerful laugh Well because it was important that you knew for yourself you see Theres not many people who can go to Hell with a whole heart or who really and truly want to belong to Asmodeus when Asmodeus cares so little about them Many many many fewer people than have convinced themselves that theyre okay with it The strange being looks sad now Not many people in Cheliax would make the decision you just did if they had really been to Elysium and if they really thought they could stay If Asmodeuss followers had any sense theyd throw you a huge party about it when you got back to Golarion but they wont do that either Most of them wont want to admit if they even let themselves know it that they would never do what you did

On reflection the Elysians never once did tell her explicitly that she could stay just kept on asking her if she was sure she wanted to go back What in the name of Asmodeus um What is Cayden Cailean planning Why do that She doesnt expect them to just actually tell her but Chaotic Good outsider she should at least try

You dont think its just the sort of thing that Chaotic Good people do

No says Pilar This is way waaay waaaay too much effort for just getting one Asmodean to know for certain that shes an Asmodean when in fact she already knew that Elysium has affected her speech patterns Pilar notes shed better watch that when she gets back

Did she really know it though Thered be an awful lot of Asmodeans who said they were certain they were Asmodeans whod never let themselves think that wasnt true But if they were in Elysium and had the chance to stay theyd say yes in a heartbeat Could you know you werent one of those if you hadnt really tried it

Yes I could actually Pilar says But more importantly that is not the whole point of this operation What is

The strange being slyly winks one of the inhumanly huge luminous white black blue white eyes in Her head Well that would be telling But guess what the part where Cayden Cailean turned you into His oracle is going to help Asmodeus in the end

Really

Really Youre truly loyal to Asmodeus Pilar Im not going to say wed never use somebody like you against her own god but its still the sort of thing that Good prefers not to do According to Asmodeuss own values Hell be better off in the world where Pilar Pineda became an oracle of Cayden Cailean than in the world where you didnt Obviously thats not the real point from Cayden Caileans perspective but it still happens to be true

Chaotic Good and Lawful Evil dont have a whole lot of common interests but they do have some Is this about keeping Rovagug sealed or the Worldwound or something

One of those three for sure

Pilar can feel herself to have almost entirely faded now Golarion is calling her its not her home but its on her way

And maybe its not the real point either says the un reality looking bright pink sort of horse but with so many people in Hell who dont want to be there it would be sad if one of the very few people who did want to be there couldnt go Asmodeus isnt a friend to anyone but that doesnt mean He doesnt need anyone to be a friend to Him After all sometimes 

Pilar hears the last words with her souls mind more than her souls ears

 friendship can be the greatest magic of all

Though the Element of Laughter murmurs to herself a little sadder by the now empty pool this isnt one of those times

Carissa has no idea who in the palace shes supposed to report to and is mildly worried that if she just wanders around shell either run into the Queen hi your Imperial Majestrix you can do whatever youd like or run into someone that some random god can oracle or otherwise work through if shes not more or less immediately stopped by Security shell try for a temple

Security will direct her quickly enough to Maillol whos in a temporary guest office at the annex temple

Sevar Hes had any sleep now and is going to need to have it for an entire damned week until his Ring of Sustenance kicks in again

Well thats one of her questions answered which was whether he was back and Project related decisionmaking appropriately located so that she can stop doing it The other things she wants to know are whether Pilars back or whether she should start setting up excuses for that evaluating a Pilar replacement whether anyone has any guesses on the mysterious Second Law that allowed Keltham to predict Pilar would enjoy being forced and have an interesting backstory and in the spirit of continuing to be proactive about this whether the Church has any correction for me

Im probably just stupid from the Raise Dead but I seem to be unable to find any flaws to pick in your performance over the last half day Perhaps Ill have found some tomorrow

Pilars back carrying a story that got her instantly kicked to the almost but not quite absolute top priority line to talk to Aspexia Rugatonn which is unfortunately a pretty long line while the gods are at war

Sevar is unfortunately the expert on whatever the Abyss this Second Law business is about Maillol can barely understand any of the game Sevar is playing against Kelthams mastery of the Law hes already lectured on If it wasnt for Sevars thought transcripts nobody else reading the surface conversation wouldve realized that there was a great mystery here in the first place

Still even with everyone incredibly busy theres probably somebody here in the palace who can beat Kelthams Will save on Detect Thoughts with enough reliability to make it worth the risk Though they should probably ready a story about Nidal infiltrators in case that person fucks up

Anyways Maillol cant think of anything besides sending in somebody to ask Keltham why he thinks one girl is a hidden Kuthite cleric and hoping that makes him think about the Second Law Maybe have somebody go in whos old and impressive looking and wearing a big visible intelligence headband so that Keltham is more likely to try to explain to them than to Sevar All they need is for one of Cheliaxs three eighth circle wizards to have the time available for a Detect Thoughts During a war with Nidal Well theres also always Aspexia Rugatonn its not like shed be busy Or Gorthoklek as the general of Cheliaxs armies this must be like a vacation for him

I assume I cant be of any help to the war effort thats worth distracting me from Keltham but if I can hed accept that as a reason for me to be doing other things Carissa would have some kind of feelings about how she had the best spellcraft of anyone at the Worldwound including the wizards with two circles on her and can only serve Cheliax by getting chained up in bed except that would be pathetic 

It may be useful to have him think something like that exists when it doesnt to give you an excuse to be places but youre the one in charge of lies

I am still making an effort to understand Keltham myself in case youre not available so Sevar correct me if I am mistaken My guess is that youll say that Keltham doesnt think quite the same way we do about how hes obviously more important than anything you can do for the war effort but that its still a lie he might notice as out of place even if its not instantly obvious to him the same way Confirm or correct me

He would try to extrapolate the equilibrium where third circle wizards on a secret directly divinely commanded project are needed for the war effort and something wouldnt add up I dont know what but if were not in fact doing it then theres a reason were not which bottoms out in reality maybe in pieces of it he can see

 right Maillol really hopes that going around saying extrapolate the equilibrium where instead of just figure out how things work if is meaningful and important and not when you start saying it a sign of increasing Kelthamization

Give me your current best guess about when Cheliax will gain more than it loses from resuming extraction of information from Keltham given that your thought transcripts suggest genuine and not simply posed concern about his ability to recover from the shock We could find a spare room within the Palaces Forbiddance for lessons but not if were eating our seed grain by doing that The actual call will remain yours after further observation of Keltham

He thinks hell be better by tomorrow or the next day I predict hes right though he seems quite not okay right now and if hes still like this tomorrow Ill push it off

Understood

Theres been a suggestion to have a third party tell Keltham useful things about your sexuality preferably true ones that he might be hesitant to believe from you directly Such as that you are attracted to him in part because of the actual power he holds over you in the sense that you know Cheliax would let him do anything to you if he made that a condition of cooperating with us and that if he never exercises any power over you you may lose some interest Supposedly we know how you work because people with lots of experience with submissives can guess that by looking closely at you and how you behave around Keltham as some people in our Governance are of course doing in the background That Cheliax would let him do anything he wanted would be true in every sane country in the world and Taldor specifically and therefore goes the argument passes your condition on how we tell him Cheliax works

I do think itll be important progress for him to understand that were not pretending and that I dont even wish we were I am not sure who hed trust to hear it from maybe Ione if she recovers maybe Pilar I do predict that most possible ways of saying to him you know you can actually not for pretend do whatever you want result in a freakout like the one he had over the idea that you get executed for trying to overthrow the government but there might be something 

 if I were trying to broach it to him which has the disadvantage that Im not going to say Ill get bored if he doesnt keep up what Id say is that I disliked it in the sex shop how it seemed like it was set up for mostly people who wanted to pretend and that if I wanted that Id have said to him act like you can do whatever youd like to me until I tell you to stop or something and I didnt and that a consequence of what I said instead as far as Cheliax is concerned is that he is actually entitled to do whatever hed like and if he wanted to chain me up again and I was being difficult about it he could call in Security and no oned blink at that and even though I expect hes nowhere near the point where hed enjoy my being defiant I like knowing its real

But that of course even in Taldor it wouldnt matter at all what I had to say about it and we do have to introduce that at some point as I understand it

I believe the central concept is that we lie that Governance would be unhappy and then go along with it but tell the truth that the actual power this gives him is important to your sexuality Governance is not telling him this to encourage him of course but because its an important fact for somebody like him to know about somebody like you He should not suggest that you have any power to restrain him from doing whatever he wants because in fact you dont have that power and that fact is very important to you

 yes Okay I think thats a good idea Im not sure who can pull it off Im authorizing the lie that Governance would be unhappy though even in Taldor Im not actually convinced they would

Cheliax was Taldor and mostly still is Taldor but is in the process of being reformed by a newly ascendant Queen who has negotiated a pact with the wise and benevolent Asmodeus Asmodeuss Church would be displeased by that sort of thing happening without good reason but would in this case weigh the many problems in this country and decide that keeping Keltham happy was far more than enough good reason

Palace has plenty of dignified looking people with very high Splendour who could pull it off I think the main delay is going to be waiting on somebody who can cast Detect Thoughts so we can ask about his Nidal infiltrator theory too

All right Another option because I think hes going to want to talk about exclusivity in a little while is to have someone drop in and ask him if they can rent me and give a justification along these lines Carissa has a hard time pinning down a lot of her intuitions about Keltham but she expects that he will have some kind of feelings about look shes into stuff thats much more serious than you are prepared to offer and if that take is given by someone with an obvious self interest then its also easier if its disastrous for him to reject it without reaching any far reaching conclusions about Cheliax Also whether he ends up agreeing or not hell end up wanting to learn the skills he doesnt have and also it seems like fertile territory for things he might turn out to be into 

My read on Keltham is that there are some kinds of people to whom hell show some tiny fraction of what we consider elementary deference Contessa Lrilatha being the most obvious His interactions with senior Security also seem promising If the person trying to rent you isnt wearing a visible 6 headband it seems less likely that Keltham will process them as whoever he thinks hes supposed to listen to And if we send in somebody like that why are they trying to rent you and not a hundred other women they could afford

This is a fantastic question someone should ask the Queen

She doesnt say that not that not saying it much limits the damage of thinking it Fair enough I guess it can wait on someone who can manage the Detect Thoughts

Thats it If youve got nothing else go prepare spells

Maillol is in fact concerned about the degree to which Sevar seems to be developing genuine attachment for Keltham but the last time she spoke out of that attachment she made tremendous progress on Keltham because it fit into whatever mysterious theories he uses Maillol still thinks on the whole that in the ordinary course of Asmodeuss Law he would not correct her yet Of course that would be because he was regarding her as a disposable pawn but if thats what Sevar proves to be so be it

Carissa asks after and receives a room next to Kelthams smaller than his and less doom punk clearly meant for the entourage of the person in the main room but not meant for their slaves She prepares spells

Maillol files a request for someone at eighth circle who can cast Detect Thoughts and or somebody with very high Splendour who can talk to Keltham about the mystery of where hes getting his deductions and also talk with him about Carissa Sevars sexuality specifically about her need to be in somebody elses power and possibly also hes not sure how the details of this could look but hes not the one with the Splendour manage to introduce the topic of somebody else wanting to rent Sevar from Keltham in a way that wont set him off or look wildly implausible

Maillol isnt going to realize for a while the incredible depth and thoroughness of the blunder hes just committed and by the time he does it will be far too late

Keltham tries to recollect what he can of the items in Iones list that seemed at all interesting as now seen from a somewhat different standpoint he cant recollect much of it though that visibly helps a lot under the new conditions spends some time figuring stuff out spends more time trying to figure out if he can do any better and then prays

He does receive his spells this time though with no sense of his own god looking back

Keltham now has

0th Detect Magic Guidance what should be Detect Poison what should be Create Water

Create Water seems like the most munchkinable thing thats a cantrip Which isnt very munchkinable but at 4 gallons per caster circle maybe he can do something with repeatably suddenly 16 gallons of water in an emergency situation

1st Truthspell x3 Fairness x2 Sanctuary Protection Comprehend Languages

2nd Augury x3 Owls Wisdom Early Judgment

Taking the Early Judgment spell seems a little unsafe like theyd only sell that magic in a Shop of Ill Advised Consumer Goods because its too potentially addictive But it also seems important to have around at least for today in case he needs to make a mental recovery

3rd used on 2 1sts and a 2nd

4th Enchantment Foil what should be Sending

That leaves him with some time left while Carissa preps spells which hell first use to Prestidigitate his clothing clean over the sink in the ensuite bathroom not that Keltham is remembering to be appreciative of this incredible luxury

Then Keltham attempts to think for a bit his thoughts tentatively trying out a review of recent events before he concludes that in fact he shouldnt do that and should try to decompress more instead while hes alone by himself in the quiet but for the sound of rain outside

Hell poke through the fourteen volume history on Absalom which becomes more interesting after it becomes clear that Absalom is where the Starstone resides The quality of the reasoning in the history books is something like six times better than those of the books in the villa library more like 1 reasoning error per 2 sentences instead of 3 reasoning errors per 1 sentence

 is that because the palace can afford better books than but why why would books information you should just be able to reprint the best versions of things if the information exists do more intelligent authors demand incredibly high book royalties to the point where most people cant afford good information about basic subjects Golarion why

The books contents seem to be dated to before Aroden died which if Keltham is recalling correctly was a century ago Maybe thats at least how long it took for the slightly smarter and better reasoned book to have its copyright decay to where it could sell enough copies to be worth printing Golarion again why Information is very easy to copy once it exists information on core topics is among the most blatant possible cases where Civilization has an interest in everybody being able to afford it

All the altruistic smart people are off being wizards at the Worldwound maybe

Carissa knocks on his door an hour later

Enter

Carissa finds it encouraging how quickly he is warming up to this Shell enter and kneel at his side over in the reading nook if thats what hes doing She has never done this before and feels faintly ridiculous but whats important is whether Keltham is into it

Enter would actually be among the things youd say in Baseline if somebody knocked and it wouldnt especially be a command Its just that its okay by me if you want to come in would be more syllables than Civilization would choose to encode into a query response pattern that gets used like over a billion times a day

And now Carissa is on her knees on the pillow beside the reading nook Obviously no such custom exists in Civilization and kneeling itself wouldnt mean anything there but its clearly a standard thing given the pillow beside the reading nook

He doesnt ask what this clearly standard thing standardly encodes because part of him seems to feel that the meaning is somehow obvious Not all of it and maybe hes completely wrong it just obviously seems like something that you wouldnt do unless you are to him what Carissa is to him so it means at least that

He reaches over and ruffles her hair because that feels right Hey he says

Hey I have reported to Security and prepared my spells and been assigned a room though yours is fancier I think they like you better probably because of how youre going to bring about the technological revolution and make the world a place Zon Kuthon wont consent to permitting to exist

Well if your room isnt fancy at all maybe Ill go complain Your room being fancy and my room being fancier seems like a reasonable premise for a relationship like this one

Any updates from Security on Ione Pilar Asmodia gods or timelines on project resume

Lean Iones not awake yet they threw some fancier healing at her in case that helps this isnt very much of a bad sign though if its still true this evening it will be Pilars back She ended up in Elysium the Chaotic Good afterlife for some reason I didnt ask more questions because that sort of thing can be personal but I bet shed tell you about it if you ask Asmodias not back yet Pilar ended up elevated priority because they wanted to ask her questions about how she ended up in our mission out of the villa but it sounds like she doesnt know any more than we do Asmodias going to require a seventh circle spell Regenerate because of her legs so she might be a week or so in wartime like this 

I asked if I could help with the war effort but was told to stay focused on this

I think theyre ready to resume once you are they could set up a room here for classes but dont want to push you if youre not ready

Keltham is a bit startled that Carissa would just tell him that Pilar ended up in Elysium That shouldve been something he had to figure out on his own by talking to Pilar or investigating her or something Pilar shouldve been left more mysterious than that until their first date or until he did something to appeal to her if those tropes were governing here Call it maybe 6 times as likely on the theory Chelish Governance asked Pilar what and found out a weird thing and promptly and sensibly told Carissa so she could tell me as on the theory this is an ero LARP With possible amendments if the Chaotic Good thing turns out to be itself much more mysterious but still Keltham making the first discovery that starts the mystery trail should require that he start Pilars route like at all Or maybe that happened when she took a 3 vicious nasty bigsword for him

But still a surprise not advance predicted not the main thing the theory obviously says You dont want to rationalize those out the window Maybe call it 31 instead of 61 though

Well huh Keltham says the details there would be a bit hard to explain but thats some small evidence against the reasoning system I was using to infer that one of the girls is a secret Zon Kuthon cleric or that one of the more unusual girls in class will have the being forced fetish Not decisive or anything but noticeable jolt The key is knowing how to keep track of that sort of thing over time which is what Id otherwise have planned to lecture on next the Law for accumulating pieces of evidence that arent individually decisive until they add up to something

Asmodias going to end up pretty behind in a week at the rate we were going Im not sure how much you can recover from that sort of thing by reading notes in a situation like this one well maybe somebody else could teach Asmodia to help solidify the material in their own minds by teaching it thats a big part of the reason why older kids teach younger ones in dath ilan Still thatd be a big chunk of someones time Depending on how expensive a seventh circle Regenerate is well except that they are going to do it at all eventually so were not paying from zero I probably want to expend some political capital on it happening earlier if the project is considered competitive with war demands at all

I could teach a class today for sure Whether I should maybe not so much if the view from above says that somebody in my position is supposed to take one day off and it probably does

 telling Keltham about Pilar was a correct move in the Second Law game Okay Carissa doesnt understand why and would REALLY LIKE someone to read Kelthams thoughts and try to get more but its information and as Keltham says you can use a little of that at a time It might literally be cheaper to pass Asmodia a two way mirror in Hell so she can keep up she says But I think its reasonable to press them on getting her back sooner

 they can do that Neat Ive got no objection to that if its cheaper key thing is Asmodia can ask questions from where she is and get them answered Pass it to them next time you see them ahem

Pass it to them the next time you see them unless I tell you that Ive passed it on first

Or is this not a giving orders occasion One thing is for sure he needs to not just ask Carissa what hes allowed to do Brain registers a desire to scream internally Approved AAAAHHHHHHH WHY CANT ANYONE LEGIBLE IN GOLARION Thank you brain now shut up if that was an error it wasnt a critical error and eventually things will be fine

Will do Carissa would kill quite a large number of people to be able to read Kelthams mind right now

Is this obedience turning him on Yes it is apparently and furthermore his mind feels blank if he tries to figure out what else to talk to her about so Youre allowed to start pestering me for sex again by the way since its now morning No promises of course but youre allowed to try

Before yesterday turned out so eventful I was planning to show you what I got from the fancy Ostenso sex shop And maybe invite you to come with me sometime but thats looking less likely now Maybe they can bring a selection to us

Well that sounds promising What new outfits or toys have I unlocked after our latest relationship progress

I actually bought this outfit there Should I tell you why they sell it at a sex shop not a normal tailors or would you rather experiment

Now thats the dath ilani equivalent of asking a dukes son if hes too scared to go rhinoceros racing

Experimentation follows

The experiment is a success More resources are allocated to following up on these discoveries

 this scientific investigation might possibly be threatening to get a little out of control and investigate subject matters that could perhaps be regarded as dangerous without a verified sufficient level of safety precautions

Keltham accordingly restrains himself but this is going to be pretty darned visible as a fact if you have Carissas Sense Motive opposing what passes for Kelthams Bluff

Carissas mostly playing by intuition lately on a moment by moment basis but shes aware that most of the point of seducing people for strategic reasons is that you can get strategic concessions out of them when their judgment is compromised And also that dath ilan would definitely know this and advise their kids against it So well see who is better at this Cheliax or dath ilan 

She pulls herself away sits cross legged folds her hands tries to look like shes trying hard not to say anything like shes sad and not quite pretending otherwise but certainly not trying to put it in his way 

Keltham attempts to roll his Sense Cognitive Background State devises a guess

Uh if I trust my ability to read you you look like somebody with a problem shed usually and normally hide because thats what normal people in Golarion do in this situation but you remembered that I asked you to err on the side of a lot more visibility and now youre wobbling between that request and the reason why a normal person would usually hide that

I wont ask followup questions until Ive either been told my current guess is wrong or Ive received some indication from you that youve reached your own estimate using the information you have and I dont that it is safe for me to inquire further

Done flaming shit that was hard to phrase without asking her to make a decision instead of him If this doesnt rapidly get easier with practice Keltham is going to use his Unilateral Relationship Decisions Power to metadecide that he gets to ask Carissa to decide things ever

I think maybe people would hide this in dath ilan too actually On the principle that uh it seems wildly more important than not pressuring people into sex But your orders take precedence I think If I calculated that wrong well probably we will calculate lots of things wrong at first

I need an explicit statement of your guess using the information you have that I dont that its okay for me to ask more questions I have no idea what youre potentially protecting me from right now or what costs there are to my knowing something thats supposed to be unknown to me or even just illegible

It is fine for you to ask more questions

Theres a very distinct ouch of realizing that he may have pressed her too hard just then to be legible and not subtle when on the meta level discussing safety But shell survive she promised him that

Kay Whats wrong

You think that theres a substantial chance not a large one but one worth planning around that I am actually lying to you about having reliable contraception and planning to I guess get pregnant and then run off before anyone notices to some country where I wouldnt be legally obliged to have an abortion And I understand why the chance of that doesnt have to be very large to be very important to you And I understand that you dont have much reason to trust me though I and I think your god have been trying to give you some And I understand that none of that matters and you can have the stupidest reason in the world and its fine its your choice you can have whatever you want from me and it doesnt have to be 

 but it does make me sad And I dont see why youd believe that its not more information but but it does make me sad Is all Now you have all the information that I have

 and uh I remain very uncertain if you actually meant me not to hide things like that its fine if you didnt mean that kind of thing most people wouldnt mean that kind of thing

Hell gather her in to hug her It is what I meant Thank you for not just hiding the whole thing I appreciate that part a lot And I understand Its my responsibility to not be unduly influenced by you being sad Now that Ive asked you not to hide what youd usually hide at least for a while

 snuggle Okay m not asking you to be influenced Both Keltham deciding to fuck her and Keltham deciding to not care about her feelings are good outcomes here

This is usually where I would apply creativity its just I have so little grasp of magic and all the people I would otherwise ask might be assuming the premise in a conspiracy with you

Though Ione might be less likely than some but no for purposes of deciding whether its okay to risk having kids he needs to assume that Ione is scripted by Governance not by some metalevel eroLARP and cant be trusted either

I know what Science Maniac Verrez would do in this situation namely figure out how to use Prestidigitation to impose a magnet field over his own sperm the way that mature male contraception technology works in dath ilan But in real life if you try that sort of thing well no actually I guess I could heal myself if I hurt myself Unless I gave myself cancer But that Id guess just takes a more powerful cleric spell And even if I literally kill myself you could bring me back but the problem is verifying that the sperm are actually dead and that the silly clever trick worked when I cant ask anybody here to help me figure out how to verify whether sperm are alive but there was a spell Detect Life on Iones list Im pretty sure and if I ask my god to give me that I can see if it works on sperm and then it goes through my god rather than anyone here 

Or actually potentially simpler solutions Is there a fourth circle or lower spell I can ask my god to give me that would let me create a small object that isnt as fragile as Prestidigitating that and can have properties like impermeability to fluid adhesion to skin until dispelled

Keltham is now attempting to invent birth control via condoms from scratch His first visualization is a small patch that fits over the tip of his urethra and will contain the liquid that emerges from it

 which is neither of the good outcomes Why is Keltham like this I feel like there are plenty of solutions if killing people is considered an acceptable cost and you should not do things that are at all likely to kill you

I dont actually know what would be a solution if killing people is an acceptable cost though it sounds like its not at all a great time to ask Cheliax to burn a resurrection on that

I mean to be clear under the circumstances I might not be able to trust your solution but I admit to being pretty curious about what else Golarion will trade a heap of dead bodies for

Keltham has entered Problem Solving Mode Good work for having a Problem Carissa

Well you could kill me because pregnancies dont survive dying and being raised and you could test that in advance on some other women who were pregnant and preferred not to be if you didnt want to just trust it Or you could kill me and then instead of a resurrection do a Planar Binding to bring me back from Hell because devils cant get pregnant I dont know how you could verify that but Asmodeus probably wouldnt bother with Cheliax if devils could just make more of themselves in Hell I am not very impressed with these solutions but what happens to me if I die is much more definitely known and understood than what happens to you so if were using death related contraceptive methods here

Remind me of what your usual contraception is like I think you may have told me but I forgot

Pregnancy also does not survive a Polymorph to any form that cant itself sustain a pregnancy and the cheapest polymorph thats sufficient is second circle Alter Self so I go male and back every night when its potentially relevant

Very easy to verify you doing though the thought is more than slightly odd but the trouble is at the appropriate level of paranoia I have only sources inside Cheliax to tell me that Alter Self works for aborting pregnancy If I ask my god for a spell to detect whether youre pregnant do you know if I get one

I dont think a spell for that exists You cant tell with Detect Intelligence until 12 weeks along You could have some pregnant people in to Alter Self in front of you

Oof thats a Cost there if it has to be 12 weeks along meaning they couldnt just find somebody who didnt actually want a baby and pay them to participate in the experiment Though maybe Cheliax has some wizards who only do the Alter Self thing after they detect or change their minds and advertising for one of those would turn somebody up it doesnt really solve the main problem though because he cant be sure that what works at 12 weeks works at 1 hour

If you Alter Self immediately after sex then shift back would I be able to check inside you and verify that the semen had vanished Maybe Id be willing to try for the further trust in that case that semen doesnt persist in a vagina or uterus that you dont have actually no shit I cant rely on that because you could also produce that result with Prestidigitation even if it wouldnt ordinarily happen from Alter Self No wait counter 2 arguendo if you can cast Alter Self and come back fast enough I can have Detect Magic running the whole time check your vaginal contents before and after and verify that Alter Self was the only magic to affect you over that period 

This is actually kind of fascinating as Compounding Capabilities problems go Maybe the eroLARP is deconstructing a computer game where the player needed to drag the spells from a list of available spells to form the correct structure to eliminate a pregnancy before they could fuck anybody That sounds like how a computer game version of an eroLARP would work

Carissa has this job mostly because she is much less inclined than everyone else in Cheliax to throw up her hands at Keltham and go MY DIAGNOSIS IS THAT HE IS AN INSANE PERSON but shes sort of feeling that right now I am willing to do that if youd like it

I think probably if we were secretly a Dread Empire wed just mind control you about this though

I appreciate and update on the argument knowing as little as I do about mind control or about how Hypothetical Bad Asmodeus might be concerned about my own god counterescalating its not enough to decide the issue Admittedly if you carefully demonstrated mind control capabilities that can just completely undetectably to me make me believe or decide things that would be a larger update than Ive made so far about good Cheliax intentions thered still be the possibility you were in a balance against my god but itd be an update

Does that process give me the result I need to observe on your prediction Detect Magic check vagina Alter Self de Alter check vagina to verify that the process vanishes semen

 mind control can do that I dont know spells like that myself but I would expect high ranking palace security do What an incredibly convenient way to build trust actually have a sufficiently high level caster cast Suggestion on him and then promise that it hasnt otherwise been done Which it hasnt because Asmodeus said not to perhaps because it was worth it 

And I think that process works

Its kind of complicated and tight is the thing for a poorly tested process he isnt sure that he can detect whether or not a vagina contains semen in the first place but then its basically backup against an itself improbable conspiracy not the primary means of birth control

One also needs to consider that at a sufficient level of magical power and ill intent they could have done something clever when he had sex with Carissa the previous day quickly moving semen from her mouth to her vagina maybe as screened by an illusion Heck they couldve teleported sperm right out of his epididymis while he was sleeping in the villa the first night before the Forbiddance went up though theyd also have to mix it with seminal fluid to have a chance for the sperm to survive a uterus

Keltham lets out a sigh No promises but Ill think about it and tell you tonight whether to prepare Alter Self tomorrow

Well thats progress And on some level she can respect how careful Keltham is respect that while he does seem to care about her more than is healthy hes not actually an idiot about it probably almost every Chelish teenage boy would do worse 

Well Better to keep pushing Lightly I prepare it every day Hope springs eternal and also we havent actually talked about exclusivity yet

I will possibly maybe think about it faster then but this is security reasoning and cant be a quick decision And exclusivity Like monogamy things Im not quite sure what that has to do with intercourse

Well see I am expecting you to order me not to have sex with other people without your permission but absent such orders I might you know proposition someone who has an incredibly cool armored vest and then want to have my Alter Self for that

Heh Point to you for catching me out on that I think my brain is Assuming Things that have not been discussed If it wasnt just a more routine false closed world assumption with respect to my ignorance of anybody else you wanted to have sex with implying that I was the only such person

I feel strangely like theres a part of me that wants that thing to be true of you that you ask my permission but I also feel reluctant to give you that order right this instant and Im going to have to do an introspection to figure out why

Incidentally even if I cant trust it is there anything way simpler and more standard that male fourth circle clerics do to not have kids

Not that I know of 

I wasnt actually planning to go around sleeping with anyone else knowing it bothers you even though people here have really fantastic magic items But I do keep a pretty sharp distinction internally between things Ive agreed not to do and things I just definitely dont mean to so if you want it to be the first thing we should talk about that

Super valid Keltham says

Not knowing any male contraception solutions for clerics seems so incredibly odd to the point of being Suspicious Do male fourth circle clerics who dont want kids just not have intercourse ever except with expensive second circle wizard sex workers Who going on earlier things Carissa has said maybe dont exist in the first place Do female fourth circle clerics just not have intercourse period Though it does match up with an earlier statement to him that YES PLEASE CHELIAX WOULD LIKE SOME CONTRACEPTION TECHNOLOGY Or for that matter that they coughtheEroLARPcough didnt assign him any clerics in his research harem

I Im not immediately sure of where this internal resistance is coming from Some of it is coming from a source that thinks Im asking you to give me too much and will then owe you something too huge and yes I know you already noped me on that But that isnt making the feeling go away and I think its loud enough to drown out some other feeling which means I cant just go ahead and ignore the combined feeling and 

Is this an urgent question for any reason

No its not

Actually theres an even simpler solution Until tomorrow morning I order you to not have sex with anyone without my permission Whatever it is my brain thinks is scary about this whole deal it doesnt think that one day of it is scary the same way

Understood and a good occasion for me to show you my other sex shop purchase 

And she fishes it out of her Bag of Holding to explain

Keltham is intrigued but can tell that he doesnt quite understand deep in this part of him the shape hes looking at 

But I could just order you not to do that right Is the magic item for people whose partners in a relationship like this one dont trust them I can guess thats not it but Im confused

Thats not it I mean its dispellable so if I actually set my mind to getting around it I could But some people enjoy the difference between impossible and forbidden like you also dont need the chains because you could tell me to hold still but if there are chains then Im not holding still because you told me to anymore Im holding still because I cant move Different flavor also I think some people experience failures of will about obeying an order like that for weeks or months especially if youre messing with them around it enough so maybe they actually do have to worry about breaking a rule even though they didnt mean to I have never tried anything like this before so I shouldnt think too highly of myself but I think theres no order up to and including stick your hand in that fire and keep it there Id just disobey without warning you first that it was proving too difficult if I would then Im just pretending and I dont want to be just pretending

He has again that sense of being unnervingly close to some ledge on which Carissa may be trying to stabilize him or maybe push him off His mind retreats from the dangerous thing tries to talk about something lesser and more trivial and safer oh is this anything like the thing some women do in Civilization if they want to have a lot of sex available to trade for social capital or collect a large harem where they limit themselves to one actual orgasm per month and otherwise stop short of that to increase their sex drives

He forces himself to face the scary thing instead it doesnt pay to do that all day long but hes had relatively few shocking revelations today

I dont know whether Im more frightened intrigued by the notion of you wanting to make it impossible to disobey orders or the amount by which youre trying to hand me the total keys to your sexuality but both of those things feel like theyre a step too far for me to do this minute and I need to let it sink in for an hour without forcing it 

My mind is imagining you struggling inside the chains and not being able to get out though and it thinks thats very sexy much more sexy than just being chained up at all 

Im sorry I need to hear you tell me thats okay if and only if that actually is okay obviously Im not asking you to send a false signal but even after hearing you say its fine to kill you my brain still wants to hear you say whether or not its okay that Id see you struggling to get out of the chains and not let you out

It really feels like this is a situation that demands the ability to talk in metalanguage and say dequote but Carissa keeps on seeming to reject not so much that specific proposal as the entire framework of thought that would want to hear about it

 okay push the Keltham less Im sorry I dont mean to rush you to the place youll be when youre twenty five Theres not actually any rush It is definitely okay to be into me struggling in chains Its it is sexier right if the chains are actually doing something And if I didnt happen to be into it then Id say its a perfectly reasonable interest Im neutral on it and youd say reasoning with the mysterious Law Above The Other Law one of the other girls will be into it and thatd be all right too except for the part where its very confusing And if I happened to really dislike it then Id tell you it is fine to be into that but I dislike it

Im frankly going to be more than slightly freaked out if I find that the girls in the harem exactly match up to every single one of my sexual desires with no leftovers It would say some pretty unsettling things about where I am and how I got there

Uh the reasoning that would make me worry about that is definitely below the Law to be clear Itd be above the gods below the math What would it even mean to be above the Law I cant coherently imagine that Nobody gets to decide that 1 2 4

I notice my brain being a little tired of relationshipping and it occurs to me that we havent eaten breakfast and should plausibly go eat lunch or whatevers on sale or free I guess since I still havent gotten around to having any local money I should ask if this Governance location can use a channeled healing at whatever standard rates are on that But I mean we can also wrap up if you had any big important dangling issues Im not saying we have to go eat right now

It only occurs to Keltham after he speaks that he just offered Carissa options and asked her to make a decision instead of providing info to him Is that even wrong He doesnt know but that section of his brain may be tired and need to rest maybe

She seems unbothered Lunch sounds good I doubt you can sell healing in the palace even in wartime half the people here are clerics Want me to go back to my room so you can have the afternoon to think Above the gods not above Law How could something be above the gods It feels as absurd as deciding that 1 2 4 

Not sure Ill decide after lunch A thought occurs to him Oh And Carissa

Maybe Ill rethink this order later but for now 

You dont ask to be let out of the chains You can struggle in the chains but you cant say in words let me out I wont flip out if you slip up and say it once but if you keep on saying it youll be disobeying me Same if I hurt you You can tell me its painful you can advise me that a more experienced sadist in my position would probably stop but you dont tell me to stop or argue that I should stop If Im doing something to you thats going to break your ability to obey that order let me know when you see it coming Understood

She is not sure where hes going with that But I understand And a smile because shes trying to reward steps in the right direction and that seems like one 

Keltham doesnt smile back One conceals feelings perhaps but showing a smile you dont mean is quite a step beyond that it destroys the ability to signal later because how can anything mean anything after that Good is all he says

Keltham isnt at all clear on his own ability to ignore somebody asking to be let out of chains He doesnt particularly want to test it while hes still such a novice

And more importantly if Carissa Sevar does start telling him that he needs to let her out right now Keltham will know that something broke her will to obey him and that something is wrong with the entire setup

Maybe its cheating to set up a secret completely legible meta signal of meta level failure but then 

 cheating is technique after all

Then lets go eat lunch Keltham says

They get all the way as far as halfway to a small eating hall before Keltham notices a lingering confusion though to be clear they do continue walking towards lunch past this point and starts asking why a single use of Alter Self doesnt render women permanently sterile if it destroys their limited supply of eggs that have no analogue uterus to carry them in male form and why an implanted embryo would be destroyed by Alter Self if the eggs werent destroyed and why men arent rendered sterile by Alter Self during the week or whatever that duration was thats required to mature new sperm if the current sperm maturing in the epididymis get destroyed and actually maybe they should try this with food coloring if thats a thing here to see if that vanishes permanently from a vagina that temporarily doesnt exist rather than having sex thats potentially a security premise violation if the whole method proves not to work the very first time its tested

Good luck Carissa Sevar A dath ilani woman in your position would know exactly how this masculine gendertrope works but you dont

I hate Chaotic Good Aspexia Rugatonn says her voice sounding reflective and her face as impassive as always She looks up from the papers in her hand having just finished reviewing a transcript of Pilars report on her involuntary tour of Elysium I hate hate hate Chaotic Good If hatred were diamonds I could take my hatred of Chaotic Good and cast Miracle with it and have enough left over for a thousand Resurrections I would personally rather go to Abaddon than Elysium

Pilar Pineda swallows Grand High Priestess is this one permitted to ask 

Just speak your thoughts Pineda I can hear them anyways

I was confused by the Chaotic Good outsiders claim that it served Asmodeuss interests for Cayden Cailean to do what He did to me I wonder if if you think theyre telling the truth that I am not meant to be harmful to our Lord 

You dont conclude that I believe they were telling the truth from the fact that youre still alive

No because the Grand High Priestess could be unsure and wanting to keep her options open or because she could have some cunning counterplot of her own to whatever it is that Cayden Cailean is trying to do 

You are correct that Im unsure the Grand High Priestess answers her unspoken thought But while Chaotic Good is not Lawful Good under those circumstances and speaking to someone like you it is unfortunately plausible that they would tell the truth

Unfortunately Pilar thinks putting on hold her own relief if she really isnt being used against Asmodeus

Yes because now we are confused as they no doubt intended and our lives have become more complicated I rather doubt that whatever larger plot is in play that larger plot is meant to conduce to Asmodeuss interests If their plot is to destroy all Cheliax and then you are meant to prevent a new Worldwound from opening amid the ruins that is not on the whole good news Though yes even in that case we would prefer there not be another Worldwound so if some such apparent duty falls to you perform it unless directed otherwise It is the job of such as myself to counterplot against Cayden Caileans larger plan not you

Pilar nods her head She understands or thinks she does

This leaves us with the question of your behavior and performance during your trip to Elysium The Grand High Priestess regards Pilar more sternly now

Pilar isnt nearly as frightened as she should be she knows even though thats a bad thought She turned down Elysium for Asmodeus and even if its a wrong thought to think still that probably counts for something

Oh I see says the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus her face impassive You believe that you performed adequately

Is she still supposed to answer in words at all Probably unless shes told not to shes been asked a direct question No mortal performs to Asmodeuss standards Pilar answers And all imperfections are worthy of punishment if the slave is even worth that much time Pilar cant quite stop herself from thinking that imperfect and flawed slave of Asmodeus as she may be shes probably due for quite a lot less punishment than others would be in her position This thought is itself of course worthy of punishment

The face of the Grand High Priestess remains impassive Do you know how specifically you fell short

Pilar knows some parts that are obvious even to her I was unable to justify myself clearly when the Elysians asked me why I didnt want to stay if I had been more trained in theology I would have been able to 

Chaotic Good outsiders cannot be persuaded into our Lords embrace and to justify yourself to them or argue with them even taking our Lords position does not serve His interests in any way That you answered the Elysians at all is your failure not that you answered incorrectly

Pilar feels stupid I understand

What else

The Elysians told me that if I stayed in Elysium I would never again have to cast torture spells on children with no other uses in order to prove my loyalty which they somehow knew I hadnt liked doing in the academy I could feel myself swaying to that and when I felt that I knew that after I came back I would have to be retrained to do it better and without any hesitation For only a moment then I was tempted to stay

Pity says the Grand High Priestess That significantly decreases your future usefulness I will make a note in your file that you are not to be tasked with such work unless there is strong reason

Pilar doesnt know how to respond to that in words at first for being so surprised She would expect to be punished for her reluctance and corrected for her to be exempted from unpleasant work instead is something that could be mistaken for mercy and it is impossible that Aspexia Rugatonn would reason so

There will be plenty of time to train out every last one of your flaws after you are received in Hell the Grand High Priestess answers the unspoken thought Meanwhile in this world your proven loyalty is potentially useful If that is a weak and vulnerable point in you I will not have it strained without good cause and bring into question whether your loyalty remains as it was The more so if the Elysians could potentially have planned to lure us into doing exactly that after first giving us apparent reason to trust you

Again Pilar feels stupid but this is only natural when somebody who is not Aspexia Rugatonn is talking to somebody who is Aspexia Rugatonn The Elysians made her scared of something that it turned out was not in Asmodeuss interests to do to her

What else says the Grand High Priestess

Pilar swallows This part is worthy of severe punishment I had the thought several times that when they showed me Hell and what thats like for people who arent me that even if I didnt want to be in Elysium maybe it would be better if the people who wanted to be in Hell could be in Hell and the people who wanted to be in Elysium could be in Elysium

You are correct that is a thought worthy of severe punishment

Pilar bows her head

You may find it useful to contemplate however that the present nature of things is temporary In due time everyone will go to Hell and everyone will want to go to Hell

That does make Pilar feel better though shes surprised that shes getting any consolation at all when the thought is incorrect in the first place

Because if you are so flawed as to have that thought there is no point in allowing that thought even greater power over you by failing to consider what weighs against it on its own terms answers the Grand High Priestess Now Pineda answer me this Why am I the one consoling on you on this instead of you taking these issues to someone in the priesthood or simply Security whose time is far less valuable than mine

Thats a good question and Pilar is unable to stop herself from thinking that maybe its because having proven her loyalty shes now that valuable no that wouldnt make sense its Chaotic Good outsider exposure which only the Grand High Priestess is most competent to correct if it introduced any problems 

Wrong According to Securitys initial interview with you you thought of asking them for correction but you had the thought that if the Elysians were telling you the truth maybe the Security officer was also somebody whod take the chance to stay in Elysium if they believed they had that chance You were afraid that if that was true being corrected by Security would mean replacing your more correct thoughts with their less correct thoughts

Pilar did also think not that this defends her or lessens anything that she didnt distrust them in general it wasnt that she distrusted Security about Security it was just on the particular issue of being tempted to stay in Elysium thinking incorrect thoughts when youre in Elysium she couldnt trust them about that 

So the leader of Asmodeuss Church in Golarion had to personally take her valuable time to correct you because now you would not have trusted almost anyone else Now that Chaotic Good outsiders have whispered to you that you are more truly loyal to Asmodeus and more correct in your thinking and more trustworthy than the senior wizards in security

Yes Pilar whispers feeling miserable The Elysians got to her after all

Unfortunately the Elysians told you the truth This being the case your concern was simply correct Nearly all wizards in Security and indeed even most priests of Asmodeus have not proven themselves able to meet the test of true loyalty that you passed They are not authorized to correct your thoughts about Elysium or who is most loyal to Asmodeus Only myself or those I designate are authorized to so correct you

That said to state your self humbling thought more precisely great loyalty is often not the quality most critical to a commander One usually wishes for great competence foremost accompanied by whatever level of loyalty seems adequate and with some safety margin If on some rare occasion the quality we needed in a commander was the greatest possible loyalty and this was more important than your lack of experience and knowledge and power and your many other failings perhaps then you would be placed in command Nor should you mistake the possibility that your superiors are less loyal than you for your own certain knowledge of that fact Understand

Yes Pilar answers

Good After this you will report to the temple torture chamber and assign yourself whatever degree of punishment you feel is appropriate for your failures in Elysium

To say that Pilar is surprised would be an understatement indeed She will obey of course but she doesnt understand is this a test to see if shell assign herself too little punishment or if shell assign herself extra to prove her loyalty 

You are done with tests of that kind the Grand High Priestess answers You have passed the strongest version of that test which anyone could face You know your own history in more detail than I do my time is valuable and I cannot be bothered to interview you on specifics and evaluate them You do it Just assign yourself whatever tortures seem standard and appropriate for your failures If you desire any more punishment than that for reasons of faith do it on your own recognizance

Because you are trusted now

No Pilar must only be imagining that this could be the subtext here she is not not that worthy she is only a second circle wizard 

Pilar rises and turns to go

Pilar Aspexia Rugatonn says before Pilar has reached the door Her voice is if not gentle unusually not harsh Pride is one of our Lords domains As you should not be mistaken about who is above you you should also not be mistaken about who is lower Speak to me the thought you are not letting yourself think

Pilar turns back

She takes a deep breath

Grand High Priestess Pilar says if you had to lead an army of adventurers into Elysium and anyone who followed you would have a choice to stay in Elysium how many how many could you find to take with you

Eleven

Eleven Pilar thinks in dismay and even horror though she does not of course question the Grand High Priestess out loud Eleven in all of Cheliax

Oh I am sure there are many more than eleven in Cheliax who would make the choice you did to leave Elysium behind Our service to our Lord would be pathetic indeed if all the Churchs work in Cheliax these last eighty years had produced no more than eleven souls truly loyal to Him The trouble is you see Pilar that Asmodeans do lie to themselves about what choice they would make there and though this lie is also pleasing to our Lord it is still in the end a lie They would not know their disloyalty even to themselves and Detect Thoughts would not suffice to root them out The Chaotic Good outsider who spoke to you was also truthful about that aspect of things

We punish people whose disloyalty rises to the level of thoughts that we can see that they can know to themselves and while that does to some extent serve to train away disloyal thinking sometimes it only trains away the visibility In Cheliax where they know their thoughts will be read again in time that serves well enough when there is a certainty of Hell in time it serves well enough Faced with Elysium those thoughts might suddenly resurface

There are many more in Cheliax who would refuse Elysium of that I am sure There are eleven of whom I know Eleven of whom I am certain

Well Twelve now

Pilar Pineda feels prouder in that moment than she has in her entire life

There is no reward for a job well done in Cheliax says Aspexia Rugatonn Only a diminishing of punishments for failure This does not mean that a job done well never benefits you Pilar Only that if so the benefit is incidental to how it serves our Lords interests You have proven yourself as few of our Lords followers ever prove themselves and if you were not already assigned to one of the most important projects in Cheliax you soon would be

Go with Asmodeus Pilar Pineda You have done as well as mortals ever do

Thank you Youve been so super helpful to me actually do you want a cookie

Pilar turns and hurls the sourceless cookie at the wall as hard as she can Under other circumstances she would scream This was literally the finest moment she will ever have in her life and Cayden fucking Cailean just ruined it for her

Only if you let Him ruin it Aspexia Rugatonn says though the harshness is back in her voice I genuinely hope we can find something to do about your problem

Pilar departs She is reminded of the fact that Aspexia Rugatonns time is indeed valuable and how much of it just got spent on her when she sees the line of important people who were waiting outside for her to finish

The next person in that line robed as a third circle priest darts inside and slams two pieces of paper on Rugatonns desk and begins some rapid hushed report without waiting for the door to shut The door hasnt closed and sealed away the sounds within in fact when Pilar on her way out hears the Grand High Priestesss voice rising to almost a shriek He what

Somebody is about to have a very bad day and Pilar is glad its not her

She skips her way along towards the temples torture chamber for almost ten full steps before she realizes that she is fucking skipping through the halls and manages to fucking stop it

At first its not obvious to the remaining student body of the Secret Project what exactly theyre supposed to do with themselves Carissas orders when she briefly walked past them while retrieving her possessions to leave with Keltham for the imperial palace were learn about Taldor But it doesnt take them all that long to find their feet obviously no ones going to come walk them through everything like theyre children 

Security has swept the villa for things left behind by Kuthites found a couple of old chambers that were perfectly sealed up with old skeletons inside which isnt very interesting and reorganized all the bedrooms so as to make the place defensible if the project returns here though it might not There are devils openly patrolling the grounds now each of them bound within their ten foot circles its the cheapest way to get devils They cant fight much like that obviously but theyll notice it And unlike human security they dont complain about the by now fairly torrential rain 

And the whole mess is a good excuse to completely reformulate the library to be in line with the project Paxti requests permission to go with Security to Absalom book shopping and when that doesnt work Yaisa tries seducing Elias for the same privilege he sleeps with her but does not take her to Absalom which is a valuable life lesson But theres sorting through all the existing books for consistency with the new paradigm and making fun of the old Taldane romance novels and while Securitys using all their Teleports for war related travel they do go out to Ostensos bookshops and find some books published in Taldor or in pre Hell Cheliax they can work with 

By the afternoon of the day after the attack this effort is in full swing they have books in piles on the floor and are reading through them and chattering about them and sorting them and Mending them as needed They have a plan for if Keltham shows up unexpectedly theyre going to claim there was water damage to the books since a bunch of windows broke in the fight and its been raining so hard since then So that this isnt a lie theyre causing some water damage to the books

Ione wakes up with her head feeling like a watermelon that has fallen off a four story building And had its watermelon soul go to watermelon Abaddon and be hunted down by things that eat watermelon souls things with white eyes and bony hands

Everything seems dreamlike and her thoughts are like shes halfway through falling asleep thoughts that dont follow from other thoughts and therefore she needs to say as her first words when she wakes

Stop damaging books takaral This is a library takaral

 turn every laundry wizard into somebody who can apply one week male contraception if that plan works And the first thing we need to get started on that is a couple of hundred mice Well no the first thing we need to get started is a few gallons of vinegar good that translated and whatever youve got that makes vinegar foam up when you add it to vinegar But that might not work unless either you or I can get a magnet field stabilized

Carissa isnt sure this is Cheliaxs most important priority at all but its surprisingly nice actually just collaborating on a research project instead of trying to seduce Keltham into evil Summoned mice or real mice actually usually wizards use summoned mice for experiments but here in a Forbiddance itll be less complicated to get real ones What things have magnetic fields it might be easier to manipulate one that already exists and itd give me a feel for what Im manipulating 

Well magnets most obviously but if you hand me any piece of metal that could be magnetized like iron or steel I can use Prestidigitation to induce a magnet field in that and then maybe you can see if thats just as easy for you or if its somehow taking advantage of my knowledge of the Law of magnets Prestidigitation cant produce acids according to you but according to my best guess as to what Prestidigitation does it should definitely be able to shift acidity and that may have to do with my knowledge of what acidity is rather than it being a mystical property of liquids to destroy things

And definitely real mice unless summoned mice can get pregnant the whole point is to see what works to stop mouse pregnancies Well also need an expert on mouse anatomy to help me trace out where the mouse analogue to the human male epididymis is and now that I think about it that could easily require the ability make images bigger so you can examine them better And also for mice we need to focus down the Prestidigitation even smaller than it would have to go in humans which brings up the question of how good magic is at focusing forces down to tiny targets including via spellsilver stabilized magic items if that helps

Most of the time whether you can do detail work or not is just a matter of talent the limit you run into is your own ability to manipulate the magic rather than anything inherent about its behavior at small scales I dont know if that would be true if you were doing something wildly outside the range of things people try to do but mouse surgery is in the range of things people try to do Id expect We have invented the microscope Summoned animals arent around long enough to get pregnant

What is acidity

Its what lemons vinegar and stronger liquids that can dissolve metal if you know those all have in common and presumably its what the Acid Splash cantrip well fakes or so Id guess Describing it in terms of underlying Law would be a detour but also its bad news if we have to take that detour because that makes it much harder to teach laundry wizards to do it

She knew that and wanted the underlying Law but she doesnt argue I wouldnt expect that I dont have to know what chocolate underlyingly is in order to make Prestidigitation taste like it Iron steel magnet mice vinegar things that bubble mixed with vinegar just checking am I interfacing with Acquisitions for you because it takes time or because you expect some weird cultural misunderstanding or because you dont like it or because it didnt occur to you you can interface with them yourself 

Marta was I think if Im not misidentifying the pieces lying in two separate and importantly distinct places in one of the hallways Im not sure if shes considered high priority for resurrection Not really sure of who Acquisitions is right now or if there is one before the project has some sort of official restart point

But actually its more that we dont just need the mice we need a place to keep mice for a few weeks while we watch them to see if theyre pregnant and I dont know what that lab equipment looks like in Golarion I can go to Acquisitions myself if I know who that is I guess but then it feels like I might accidentally get like just two hundred mice in a giant bag I sometimes get the impression that people here who are not you may not really expect my plans to make sense or rather theyre not surprised if it only makes sense to me and not to them Which is how you end up with a giant bag of mice and no mouse food So my theory is that first I explain to you what I need and what its for and you ask me questions until youre confident youve understood and then you actually say it to Acquisitions

At one point I asked Security look this is really important I havent got any training in it do we want to now that were convinced its for real replace us with a real research team and he said uh theyd showed the transcripts of the lectures to other people but it doesnt seem to produce the same result The expecting that your plans make actual Lawful sense and I can figure out why too 

If it was that easy the Watchers wouldnt have made us play elaborate games and figure things out on our own would they when they couldve just put us somewhere sunny and let us read books about other people figuring things out

Thats why Im worried about Asmodia trying to catch up after being gone for a week Im worried it wont be as easy as her just reading the transcripts

Oh actually though before we move forwards on this I should write a note to Lrilatha asking her if she thinks its actually a good idea for laundry wizards to be able to apply male birth control thats something that affects heritage optimization over all of Golarion Have you got writing stuff in your hammerspace by any chance

Yes thats a good thing to ask her if it causes birth rates to crash among all the smart people and all the people living in areas thatve managed to make magic accessible and cheap She fishes out a pen and paper Shes probably incredibly busy what with the war so Id just write a short note and indicate what youll do if you dont hear back 

Does it cost her nothing to read Baseline or should I write in Taldane

She probably has permanent Tongues its only as expensive as a good headband but I dont specifically know for sure she has it

Keltham writes down in Taldane

From Keltham

Hypothetical project transforming
input 1 cast Prestidigitation output male sterility lasting 1 weekUnsure if expected good bad effects on Cheliax GolarionExample obvious goods
 Contraception available not just to wizards so not relatively selecting against wizards as much
 Regions able to deliberately enter equilibrium of having more resources per child not more children than resources leading to possibly higher Intelligence per child
 Regions more able to employ conscious heritage optimization over themselves fewer accidental children more deliberate onesExample obvious bad
 Possible relative birth rate crash among whoever can afford Prestidigitation live in a city

Good idea to proceed y nValue to Cheliax if successful 
Person to ask instead of you

He then folds it and writes on the outside 

What was her job title again

After being answered

Viewable only by Contessa Lrilatha

Shortly after theres a knock at the door 

Enter calls Keltham unaware of any update this might be producing in Carissa

Its the Imperial envoy who brought them to the palace and a serious looking dignified middle aged noblewoman behind him 

Announcing the Paracountess Isidre Astrid Asgavan Thrune here to see Keltham the envoy says

If you have a moment that is Isidre Thrune says pleasantly then looks more serious Or realistically more like half an hour Is this a good time

Does lots of names indicate importance Keltham remembers mention of very powerful wizards having unreasonably long names Oh and that sure is a big fancy looking headband shes wearing

Works for me if it works for Carissa

I am afraid I was hoping to speak to you alone Isidre Thrune says half inclining her head in an apologetic gesture

Keltham feels vaguely like hes supposed to check with Carissa about this but has managed to pick up the rhyme if not the reason of some Chelish interactions and does have the ill formed sense now that hes not supposed to ask Carissas okay to say yes to this

All right Keltham says

Then he runs a quick Detect Magic to see if he spots anything weird about the envoy for that small further chunk of probability in case this is a Kuthite plot Okay Keltham thinks that looks like the Arcane Mark of the person who ran a bunch of spells on him last night

Carissa curties and steps back 

From Maillols reaction she was not expecting theyd be able to get the eighth circle wizard needed for this conversation in today shes pleasantly surprised

The envoy accepts a note for Lrilatha from Keltham

Isidre Thrune escorts Keltham to a nearby interview room sumptuously appointed but not in doompunk with no external windows They will be seated across from one another in luxurious padded chairs still monstrosities of ergonomics by dath ilani standards between them an intricately carved round table bearing a variety of exotic snacks and fluted beverages

The envoy after the two go informs Sevar that they are to follow soon and silently behind Sevar will watch this interview through a one way wall so that a nearby spellcaster running Detect Thoughts can keep half an eye on Sevars own thoughts in case she wants to loudly think anything important If so the information will make its way to Isidre Thrune who has one of the highest Splendours that could be found on this much notice

Also Maillol is temporarily unavailable for a while and Sevar is back in charge for something like the next half day

 Carissa is confused but right now she should probably focus on this conversation which is fairly high stakes and poke that confusion later Here while shes at it is a shopping list for Keltham should Lrilatha approve his project

May I inquire what this is about Keltham says in his best Very Serious mode

Isidre Thrune nods I am as you may have surmised from the headband one of the highest boosted Intelligence individuals in all Cheliax and one of those who have been reviewing events on your project from here in the palace I begin by offering you the following piece of good news Ione Sala has awakened and though she is not quite returned to normal the fact that she awakened at all is good news about her prospects of eventual recovery

One of the very smart people who are smarter than the other people check Its sort of good to know they actually exist at all and are optimizing stuff in Governance here at all

Sounds like apparently good news Keltham replies Though did she seem like herself at all Like definitely Ione but afteraffects or more like didnt return to anything like being Ione yet

If they dont know about the Nethys thing he doesnt want to mention it yet at least not if she otherwise recovers anyways but hes still concerned about whether its Nethys in there now or Ione

Isidre inclines her head The former I would say though Im going on the reactions of those around Ione Sala rather than having very much acquaintance with her myself Did you expect otherwise

I am not clear on what to expect from forcible human god interactions

Mm Isidre briefly sips from one of the fluted thin glasses laid out on her side of the table Or perhaps you have a guess you arrived at by stranger means Pilar Pineda I hope youve by now heard has been resurrected after surprisingly having been located in Elysium the Chaotic Good afterlife After reviewing a recent report from Sevar on a hunch I ordered a check on whether Pineda had a fetish for as Sevar somewhat politely put it to you being forced though we would usually simply call it a rape fetish

Pilar does In fact it is what wed term an obligate fetish meaning that she has not much interest in sex without it

This is not at all surprising to us however rare such a thing may be in dath ilan here it is among the most common fetishes The fact remains that you may have been said to have somehow known it Apparently by similar and mysterious lines of reasoning that led you to worry about a hidden cleric of Zon Kuthon maybe even unknown to herself among the student wizards youve been assigned

Sevars report says that she asked and you said it was too complicated I am wondering if youd be willing to try explaining to somebody with higher Intelligence

This random noblewoman is not actually going to be able to parse the explanation whatever it is and possibly Carissa should consider the person casting Detect Thoughts to be likelier to get it than Carissa but shes not sure she does expect that They almost certainly havent actually patiently read all the project logs There arent that many people cleared to do that and theres quite a lot of project logs and a war on If Maillol he has to be in trouble thats the only reason theyd know how long hell be indisposed didnt know in advance whod be able to do this then there isnt a wizard that powerful whos up to date on the whole thing

So if Keltham does decide to explain it to Isidre then shes the one wholl have to figure out what Isidre should say 

She casts Foxs Cunning on herself just in case

If the word rape is translating at all correctly Keltham is having some trouble seeing how the notion of a rape fetish isnt as obviously paradoxical as asking somebody to rape you but presumably theres some elided meta object distinction that makes sense of it and in any case thats not the most urgent topic right now

So Pilar has the fetish But its very common locally maybe its 1 3 of the population say if hed also checked Ione then taking the universe at face value thered be a 55 probability of at least one of the two having the fetish But still it should probably be called something like one bit of evidence favoring the eroLARP hypothesis

I wasnt saying Sevar was too stupid for it Keltham replies after taking a moment to think I was saying the concept structure came at the end of a long series of other concepts that would take too long to explain Higher Intelligence doesnt let you bypass that sequence what would be needed is that you have a lot of prerequisites that Id guess to be outright unknown in Golarion

Theres also the concern about whether explaining the notion of an eroLARP to people inside the eroLARP will drive them insane or cause this universe to collapse But if Carissa is able to hear him talking about his weird theories and the very smart people immediately investigate them in Pilar and report back to him it doesnt seem like that kind of eroLARP theyre apparently allowed to know Anyways though it seems kind of foolish in retrospect he already published that private key

WHAT

Cause the universe to collapse WHAT

What the ABYSS is an eroLARP

Many thoughts Keltham thinks have pieces that are completely opaque to Abrogail Thrune because they refer to concepts that Abrogail Thrune simply doesnt have Like private key or one bit of evidence or unfortunately eroLARP It parses to her essentially as private 1 of evidence and in the most important part sex 

Is there perhaps some metaphor you could use to explain says Isidre Thrune

Metaphor huh Maybe something like pattern recognition Im not working off a fundamental Law that reduces to simple math like the things Ive been lecturing on More like Im recognizing pieces of the universe that match part of a pattern I know about and guessing about how the rest might get filled in Like actually I dont know if you have fictional novels here there werent any in the archdukes library Do you have like untrue but popular stories about I dont know some girl who wants to rule her own planet when she grows up and then shes abducted by aliens with lots of problems and has to solve those problems to become ruler of their planet I mean those wouldnt be your stories but I wouldnt know what Golarion stories are about

We have novels certainly Isidre replies Though in Cheliax most of the novels we have on hand predate the recent ascent of the Asmodean Church here and are somewhat appallingly written we have not considered it the best use of Cheliaxs sharply limited resources to make better ones exist just yet An example of the sort of thing that might be in one of those novels maybe a boy finding a magic sword falling in love with a beautiful princess using the magic sword to slay a dragon and presenting the dragons death to the princesss father to win her hand in marriage I admit I have not read many of those myself

Carissa is pleasantly surprised the answer suggests someone in the loop in fact has read all of the conversation transcripts and maybe a bit of the Taldane books besides

Certainly huh Kelthams sort of disappointed he was hoping a Very Smart Person here would know better than to talk with the probability 1 declarations sprinkled all over the crazy books here He guesses thats a matter of Law more than Intelligence

Then if someone has read a number of stories like that if they got to the point where the boy falls in love with a high status woman after having earlier obtained a magic sword they could guess the boy was going to do something with the magic sword to impress the high status woman

I see or think I see But where are you getting the patterns that youre using to determine that Pilar has a rape fetish or that one of the girls is a Kuthite sleeper operative

From reading his friends fanfictions about a currently superpopular novel deconstructing eroLARPs eroLARPs that by comparison almost nobody must have actually played compared to how many people found out about them by reading some of their friends fanfictions so they wouldnt be left out of discussions about it But thats not really what shes asking anyways

Now how to reply without panicking her over the idea that her universe might be fictional Which isnt even actually the idea here but if you dont know about computer simulations and the generalized notion of laws of physics that let you imagine alternate such laws and equivalence classes of causal structures embedded in other structures and realityfluids generalizing quantum amplitudes what do you even say that the smart but ignorant Golarion native doesnt just parse down to possibly were all just a generalized illusion or maybe trapped in some sort of book sure go panic now

Im not really sure how to say it except that the patterns are in my memories out of dath ilan and their origin in dath ilan was complicated Keltham replies I would not have particularly expected to find facts and events here corresponding to those memories And a lot of things dont correspond in that way to be clear Id have been much less confused getting here if this world was even 5 made out of things I was expecting to see But theres bits and pieces of this world all over that fit into one pattern or another And the danger is that Im just looking up at random clouds and seeing faces trees patterns in the sky that are pure coincidence As you say if the fetish is very common here then Pilar having it isnt much evidence

Now how to reply without panicking her over the idea that her universe might be fictional Which isnt even actually the idea here but if you dont know about and the generalized notion of of that let you imagine alternate such and of embedded in other and generalizing what do you even say that the smart but ignorant Golarion native doesnt just parse down to possibly were all just a generalized illusion or maybe trapped in some sort of book sure go panic now

This is the most disturbing Detect Thoughts that Abrogail has ever cast

Is Sevar thinking anything helpful

If youre a boy with a sword youd be an idiot to conclude youre in a story where you slay a dragon and marry the princess there are lots of boys with swords and almost none of them pull it off You can just look up the odds

If youre a boy from another world who has already started a war between Asmodeus and Zon Kuthon 

What would it even mean to be in a story where you change the world as distinct from being in a world where you change the world

The only thing that comes to mind that feels at all Keltham shaped is that its an answer to what put you there If Asmodeus copied Keltham into the world to explain Law then the girls are not exactly a side point theyre supposed to seduce him to Evil after all but theyre not a source of if Asmodeus copied Keltham there then you wouldnt expect one of the girls to be a Kuthite spy because the process that produced the girls wouldnt have any interest in that and most random Chelish wizarding students are not Kuthite spies 

If Keltham ended up here because she has no idea how to finish the thought but its at least a question 

Ask him is this in part a hypothesis about what process caused you to arrive here instead of nowhere or instead of somewhere that was systematically catching dead people 

Is all this tangled up with theories you have of how you came to be here instead of nowhere Or instead of somewhere that was catching dead people from your world more systematically than Golarion seems to

All right thats slightly impressive maybe the bigger headbands are actually good for anything

It would have to be yeah but I dont exactly have a lot of specifics and what specifics I have arent something Im thinking of a good metaphor for let me think Sure if youve got enough prerequisites its obvious in retrospect that the explanation for what happened to Keltham is that almost all of the copies of him ended across the multiverse of everything being infinitely embedded all over the multiverse and this is one of the Kelthams that didnt end in some universe thats either higher complexity than his original universe or of course a higher complexity specific embedded somewhere simpler than that and then arguendo if the EroLARP Hypothesis is correct he was localized to somewhere such that it has convenient evolutionarily implausible masochists who are super okay with not being let out of their chains when they struggle so that hurting them during sex which it turned out you really wanted to do doesnt get you kicked out of that city or exiled to the Last Resort

Keltham has not figured out why this would be the case but he doesnt need a specific hypothesis of why to notice what it looks like and start generating predictions

And then of course you have the problem of explaining this to a Golarion native who has no idea that her own world sure looks like it runs on quantum mechanics the same as dath ilan and how that means theres an exponentially vast number of near exact copies of her spread all over the local amplitudes to say nothing of the alternate laws of physics that embed each other as substructures

Does Taldane contain the word fanfiction No it does not Well there goes that metaphor for this world is a continuation fic of my life because in an infinite multiverse containing an infinite number of fanfiction writers no book can ever truly end which on reflection would probably have been an overly disturbing thing to try to explain anyways

There are how many of her all over the place Where and what are they even doing does dath ilan actually know all this or are they just making it up

Are you thinking possibly that you are in not one of the Outer Planes that we think of as an afterlife but rather that this entire greater universe is your afterlife ventures Isidre Thrune It doesnt seem to be what Keltham is thinking but maybe hell explain why its not

That gets Keltham to smile briefly Well this universe rather counts as my afterlife by definition what with my life having ended and this being after it I dont really have the concept of your afterlives down yet though So whatever further connotations you were thinking of importing from the standard terminology I cant say anything about those

Is Sevar possibly thinking anything useful right now

No no thats not it not that she knows what it is but she wouldnt have asked that question and shes not thinking how to she cannot wait to read the thought transcript thatll presumably make this all make perfect sense 

Are you thinking that this world was in some way created just for you Isidre says Maybe that youre the only real person here

She has not lost sight of Cheliaxs goals if Keltham thinks that he will be much easier to turn to Evil

Id have to be pretty search blind not to think of that possibility at all but I rather doubt it anybody who put me in a fake world with a Carissa who isnt real and has no internal experiences is not at all doing me a favor by that and why make a whole world for somebody if youre not doing them a favor I can tap myself with a truthspell and repeat that if your version of Governance wants assurance that Im unlikely to strangle all my students after deciding theyre not real

Its quite the opposite of what Governance wanted to hear but Abrogail didnt expect better

This seems like a good opportunity or maybe excuse would be a better word to change the subject Abrogail is starting to think that figuring out how to wield Kelthams Second Law is not in any case the incredibly good idea that it may have seemed to Sevar at the time

That does bring up another topic Id meant to discuss Isidre says We can possibly return later to the topic of the patterns youre recognizing if theres time but I wanted to be sure we covered this other topic before I return to my unfortunately busy schedule

Understood

We have a great deal more experience with people like Carissa Sevar or for that matter like yourself than dath ilan seems to have by Sevars reports Is this correct

You can just ask me to review the reports you know

But yes or rather my suspicion is that not many sadists in dath ilan know what they are and Civilization tries to prevent us from finding out because dath ilan does not have masochists If youve reviewed the transcript of my lecture on evolutionary theory as the basis of biological order the notion of enjoying pain the signal of damage to the body is not something youd expect to see Carissa if I was interpreting her correctly thought masochism might have evolved in a situation where women are continuously not having a great time but could maybe do better by bonding with their captors Id put at least even money on it being something a god put in instead or otherwise artificial

The fact that something like that even exists here that I a sadist am complemented here by a perfect complement to my own desires one that shouldnt exist is part of why I suspect that Im not in a universe that I matched up to at random

Im sorry Id meant to move on from that but are you saying that masochists in Golarion were created for you

No not in a universe I matched up to at random lots of worlds and why he ended up in this world is confusing and the most notable feature of this world from his perspective is that there are perfect matches for all his incredibly conventional kinks that dath ilan tried and only sort of succeeded at breeding out of their Lawful Good planet of Lawful Goodness Carissa would have responded Id predict that most worlds have masochists Im not sure how heavily that weighs in your reasoning 

Thatd correspond to some of the more relatively disturbing possibilities that Im sure hoping arent true because Im kind of screwed that way either by being the only real person here or by being responsible for the existence of a whole lot of other people many of whom seem not to be leading very fun lives right now

But no my main theory is that a vast or weighted infinite number of worlds exist and I was nonrandomly sent to a world where masochists exist nonrandomly dropped at the Worldwound where Id run into Carissa Sevar and by the way it so happens that whatever bureaucratic process that world used to pick the people whod be my students would happen to run across Ione and Pilar and also somewhere in there a girl whos working against the rest of us

Sala and Pineda got oracled after they met Keltham but shes not sure if this changes anything from his perspective and this cannot be asked because he doesnt know theyre oracles

Im not sure how heavily this weighs in your reasoning but I think I would expect most places to have masochists in fact It seems to me that masochists make perfect sense under the theory that you described to your class 

Dath ilani anti interruption norms with respect to Paracountess level people are much much less strong than they are in Golarion Sure youd notice if it happened often but everybody can take a few interruption tokens per conversation it doesnt mean anything

Applying evolutionary theory in general is surprisingly hard and doing it to human psychology in particular can run into a lot of pitfalls Im sorry I should have attached warnings about that we got those in the classes I took but I was trying to run through the subject on the way to other things and neglected that Theres very exact rules for what you should and shouldnt predict using that theory and if youre doing it after youve already seen what realitys answer sheet looks like theres even more precautions you need to take which rest on the Law of Probability which Id previously planned to explain today before stuff happened

Kelthams thought processes show no awareness of himself being rude only sincerity plus some background thoughts that are full of incomprehensible concepts Not that this is an excuse in Cheliax obviously but it means that reprimanding Keltham cannot be the correct move

Shes not particularly happy about being interrupted but has a great deal more impulse control than certain people seem to think

Well I wont challenge your expertise or your warning then Isidre says calmly The point remains You are a newcomer here we have had masochists for a while and we have sadists who know what they are

This I do understand and had not meant at all to contradict

I foresee some possible points of trouble ahead for the two of you and wish to avert those if possible

I am listening very intently

Sevar being the sort of woman that she is is almost certainly attracted to you in part because of a fact and quality about your situation that she is probably rather reluctant to explain directly for a number of reasons

Namely that you have in fact great power over her

Because I can fire her from the project if she what doesnt have sex with me

Keltham doesnt like it but he has started to grasp that Golarion is full of people who seem to think that the correct thing to do with a threatening decision matrix that would not counterfactually exist absent your predicted tendency to give in to threats is to give in to the threat

His world doesnt have what no this sounds like things Aspexia has told her about gods and godarrangements are they all pretending to be gods there but thats not what shes pursuing right now 

Keltham is adorable

Carissa lights her own hand on fire about this thought since other people seem to be kind of negligent on that

She so does not have time for this

As Sevar interprets her situation Isidre says seriously if she tried to leave you and you wanted to keep her anyways you could tell the government of Cheliax that you wanted to keep and have power over Carissa Sevar as a condition of your continued cooperation with us And then she thinks wed give her to you to keep you happy

This fact is important to her sexuality it very nearly is her sexuality and you need to understand that and not blunder into acts or words which cut against it

Kelthams thoughts show concealed shock and horror this is exactly the fear he had when Carissa started saying she was giving herself to him that she wanted something strange that she wasnt saying and that Keltham would prove unable to give her

He does a pretty good job of controlling his own expression for a Chelish two year old Are you saying are you implying that Im with her under false premises

What a beautiful opening Youre with her under true premises Shes exactly correct Im not necessarily saying that to encourage you to mistreat her But you need to understand Keltham there are no sane countries on the face of Golarion that would not do the equivalent of handing over Carissa Sevar to you or worse if that was the price of banishing plagues from our cities and growing enough wheat for one farmer to feed two others and closing the Worldwound and offering refuge to women in Osirion who want to leave their husbands and someday yes matching the accomplishments and wisdom of dath ilan Or perhaps the price of what those other countries would ask from you instead of that Giving one woman to you who would not enjoy being so given would not be something that pleases the modern Chelish government or the Church of Asmodeus that we work with but we would weigh the price if we did not and conclude that it was far more than worth it

So Carissa Sevar is in fact under your de facto power exactly where she wants to be and needs to be The possible problems I foresee stem from you failing to understand that this is what she needs this is what she wants this is how her sexuality works and that your de facto power to do anything you want with Sevar is part though of course not all of why she started being attracted to you in the first place It is in the interest of Cheliax for obvious reasons that you continue to be happy with Carissa fond of her home country of Cheliax energized and productive for your project and not distracted by being heartbroken after what happened when you were always careful to emphasize to Carissa how much she was free to go at any time if she didnt want to stay

I need to think about this Keltham says

I shall wait

Question 1 Are they being honest with him or not

Subquestion 11 What motive do they have to lie How do they gain from tricking him into doing something terrible to Sevar Its not like they could threaten him with the revelation of that to Governance even if they mistakenly think hed respond to a threat like that

 and now the tree isnt branching further Keltham is having more trouble than usual thinking about this Part of himself is recoiling in horror and its not because the situation being described sounds awful for Carissa its because something about it seems terrible and threatening for him

Is it that he distrusts himself with power

Is it that hes afraid of pressuring himself into doing something to Carissa that he didnt really want to do even if she turns out to want it

Is it that the ENTIRE FUCKING SITUATION IS MANDATORILY ILLEGIBLE WITH NO CAREFULLY OPTIMIZED MESHING GENDERTROPES AND NOBODY IS ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE ANYTHING IN PLAIN BASELINE

How do you know the contents of Carissas mind in such detail

Shes picked up now on some of the rhythm of Kelthams internal thoughts has noticed a notion of what does it predict did it come true much plainer in his Baseline thoughts to himself than in Taldane speech to others

I know masochists or rather submissives which is the more precise term for the relevant part of what Carissa is correlated with masochism but not identical to it I read reports on Sevar and yourself I guessed what would happen or rather had probably already happened And then I had Security ask Sevar if she had by any chance tried to tell you possibly several times that you could do anything you want to her including killing her if she thought you were ready to hear that part and she confirmed that it was so It is a very mundane form of pattern seeing that rests on having seen many such relationships play out rather than on coming here from another world but it is not I think less reliable for that To be clear I am not saying every submissive is like this but Sevar is and I can recognize that

There are I suppose other possible interpretations of why a submissive would give herself entirely to a man whom she somehow happens to be very attracted to who coincidentally happens to have de facto absolute power over her But given that Sevar has in any case told you to do anything you want with her I dont see why you would be worried that I am say trying to lure you into doing too much to her more than she wants which is itself a rather odd thing for me to try to accomplish

The part where her new dominant thats what you are does not understand that he has de facto absolute power over her where he does not understand that this fact is itself something that she needs in the foundation of her sexuality seems like something of a Fireball trap waiting to go off in somebodys face I am trying to defuse it

And the reason that you and not her are saying these things to me

First of all that is itself something you do not make a submissive do especially one like Sevar You dont make her spell out exactly what you could do to take her in a way that makes it clear you havent thought of that yourself and would never think of that yourself That makes it feel fake to her like the whole thing is pretend

Second of all I am under the perhaps mistaken impression that she tried to lead you to those answers and you did not listen perhaps because she was too close to your own age and not wearing a sufficiently impressive looking intelligence headband

Keltham tries to think about this His mind feels tired A dath ilani remains able to complete their thoughts except when under the effect of relatively significant drugs or maybe if theyre in the middle of falling asleep but right now what his mind patterns are mainly saying is Come back to this later and slower

Do you have a recommended course of action for me thats different from what I was doing already Keltham says Part of him suggests that their provided course of action will look a lot like chaining up Carissa and actually raping her a lot and ignoring her countermanded if she was still obeying requests to be let out he doesnt know why Cheliax would do that but its what it feels like theyre trying to get him to do

Oh so hes not a complete fool then in the sense that there may be a nonfool trapped inside there somewhere You should trust your instincts more Civilized boy

That business with ordering Carissa never to verbally request that he stop was really quite clever of him now that his thoughts have run over it Abrogail cant immediately see a way out of that as a checkmate against the way they were planning to lure him into Evil Carissa shouldve looked sad and told him that an order like that would take the fun out for her found some excuse to turn him down as the Keltham expert it was her job to realize what he was really doing there even if Abrogail didnt realize from the transcript If Sevar is worried shes not being punished enough she can repent her failures there

I think first and foremost that you should not press yourself too hard or make yourself unhappy by going too far too early even if thats what Sevar wants Isidre says making a sudden change of plans This is an Evil country not a Good one and among the foundational reasons for that is that Good people all trying to help each other instead of themselves seem to inevitably end up sad and unhappy at the end of it You have a Civilization to build here Keltham your role in life is not actually to make Sevar happy She is responsible for her own lifes happiness as you are for yours

With that said if you yourself for your own sake and not hers decided one day to demand that the government of Cheliax give you absolute power over her and order our Security to put her forcibly into her chains any time she didnt want to go Carissa Sevar herself would be very very happy about that But I will quite understand if you do not wish to essay that until you are confident of your ability to discern that happiness for yourself

And There are other women in Cheliax if Sevars happiest outcome is not what you want You are not obliged to give literally the first girl in this world that you talked to everything that she wants from life at your own expense That is what it means to be Evil rather than Good

A further warning Sevar is not the most extreme case of what she is Pilar Pineda is more submissive than Sevar substantially more masochistic than Sevar and would in a way very strange to you feel raped if you made her have a careful conversation about sex instead of just forcibly throwing her onto a bed My considered opinion is that if you are struggling and flailing with Sevar you are absolutely certainly not ready for Pineda

Okay Carissa likes this person that was the correct thing to tell Keltham there 

Awww Now Abrogail wants to keep the Isidre identity and develop her and let Isidre get closer to Sevar and see if she can get to the point of actual fucking before she drops the guise in the middle

 but cant possibly actually do that in real life due to being Queen of Cheliax and yes busier than that

Oh so its a theorem hes not ready for Pilar is it Kelthams brain automatically tries to generate counterexamples to this totally obviously not absolute certainty which Golarions very smart people seem to foolishly believe and gets as far as suggesting the visibly non impossible world where Kelthams own sadistic instincts would kick in and theyd have great sex and it would be fine before the rest of Kelthams brain tells that subthread to shut up One must distinguish the possible from the probable and what a local un Lawful very smart person says is absolutely certain may nonetheless be a better bet than not that

I believe I understand but I should take time to mull it over Keltham says

Please do Isidre says I do have a pending and somewhat awkward further topic but it seems wise to let this one sink in first

Keltham starts to reach for one of the snacks catches himself and tries a Detect Poison first now that he has that cantrip

Nothing shows up but then its not like hes tried with a known poison to check that the cantrip is working

Isidre smiles slightly They do check the food before they serve it to me you know let alone to you

Why trust what you can verify Keltham says unapologetically and eats a snack

 actually why did he use Detect Poison this time when he didnt think to try it in the dining hall before

Are his instincts trying to tell him something Keltham now wishes he hadnt eaten that snack but hes at least not going to eat any more

His brain still running in the background and creative as ever suggests that if this is an eroLARP ish context and therefore Keltham has a dreadful buried urge to rape somebody which Pilar matches he could in fact run three Augury spells before trying that to check what the consequences would be Obviously after having first done a bunch more work to verify that the Augury uses his own utility function or a sufficiently aligned neighboring one

Keltham tells that thread to shut up Hes starting to doubt this whole eroLARP business if it implies that he would enjoy that Anyways the concept of a rape fetish in the sense of wanting unwanted sex is literally paradoxical and the term presumably means something else

Keltham thinks in such a fascinating way Actually theres something about it that reminds Abrogail of herself contrasted to the way that most people who are not Abrogail dont seem to usually try to be clever possibly because they expect theyll be punished for trying Keltham is all about the cleverness not in the false artificial way that Abrogail associates with people who are not Abrogail but in a genuine way that permeates all his thoughts He is constantly thinking of ways to make his day even more fun one might say if not in quite the same way as herself

Theyre also going to have to prevent Keltham from finding out the False Future spell exists Can they do something clever with that with giving him false answers to Auguries The trouble is if you have sufficiently good cause to think youre helping somebody it may not count as Evil Even if Pharasma counts it it may not help in the sense that it fails to corrupt Keltham in the required way

You say Keltham says after some further contemplation and letting things sink in that youd give Carissa to me even if she didnt want to go because the other lives at stake in Cheliax outweighed her life Then you do not seem to feel yourself forbidden to do that sort of thing to override the deontology meant to be reliable without having to think about it a lot and forcing everyone else to think about it a lot rules and protections and guardrails around one life when many other lives are at stake Then inquiring minds might want to know if you would not also in the event I stopped cooperating with Cheliax decide to try to keep me here anyways with so many lives at stake If we hadnt made and then formalized an agreement saying otherwise that is

And perhaps even if they had made that agreement because somebody breaking an oath and going to Abaddon over it is maybe still worth it for them

Sevar should have foreseen this annoying fucking consequence of giving him that planned story about her sexuality Abrogail herself should have seen it coming really Its a stereotypically Good thing to say and his Good society would absolutely have programmed that particular whiny complaint into everybody from childhood Its just not easy to think like that

Isidre inclines her head And youre wondering why we didnt just kidnap you here directly from the Worldwound and not make any agreements with you first if thats how we operate

Its very obvious why they wouldnt do that especially if they were okay with sacrificing a few souls to Abaddon if that became necessary namely to keep Keltham cooperative at the start This would be my own primary objection to societies that are Good instead of Lawful and from my perspective no society on Golarion is remotely Lawful There was also a certain tendency in dath ilan for the very smart people who are smarter than the other people to also lean more Good but kept sensible in our own case by Law that those very smart people comprehend far better than I do I get along fine with Carissa and expect to get along fine with my other research group members I am concerned that perhaps the upper rank of Chelish Governance is a little too Good for me

Why is her life like this

In theory Isidre says unperturbed theres a set of complicated replies here and in practice a much simpler one In theory for example you arrived at the Worldwound which is itself governed by treaties that Cheliax signed and indeed had a primary hand in designing we could not have stopped you from walking out on us there and so it was reasonable to offer you guarantees to come away from the Worldwound to Cheliax proper In theory our government has never said to Carissa Sevar at any point that we would not sacrifice her if that becomes necessary its not that wed be violating a rule around her but that its understood that this sort of thing might unfortunately happen because all of Golarion is in a far more precarious situation than dath ilan In principle if Sevar had been disturbed enough by that she could have tried to sign a compact with the government saying otherwise which we would have kept if signed but Sevar would have needed to find something to make it worth our while to sign that compact and it would have been pointless and expensive and not really worth it And if you ask why Sevar didnt go to a country with more rules instead my reply would be that while there are some countries with many more rules they are not good ones and also that moving countries is expensive in Golarion and not just in the cost of the teleport In the understandings that exist in Golarion Cheliax is starting with you from scratch not from the sort of relationship we had with Sevar as a citizen where its understood that we can sacrifice her if necessary for some much larger benefit

In practice the actual and much simpler reply is that the revelation from Asmodeus which led to this projects establishment said or at least we think this is what Asmodeus was trying to say to not pull any of that on you So no such discussion was ever entertained at any level of government If youre looking for a simple answer that doesnt require you to worry about backroom discussions by people like me its right there I suppose Possibly thats why Asmodeus ordained it so if you feel that way I dont think we would have decided to unsheathe blades at you absent His order but I can see His order simplifying things from your perspective

You might be well served at some point by contemplating in more detail why Asmodeus found it necessary to do that and pay out what I gather to be very limited communications capacity on doing that He would not have needed to do it in dath ilan for all that dath ilan is supposedly a Good country and Cheliax is supposedly an Evil one But yeah Im glad Asmodeus had his act together there

Isidre inclines her head again As you say and yes you may well be right We are very aware of how far short we fall of Asmodeuss wisdom

That couldnt actually be the reason for Asmodeuss instructions could it No it has to be some pre existing godagreement or a bargain with Abadar and Nethys whose initial premise was that they cooperated to bring Keltham here and Cheliax got first crack at him or one of the other likely possibilities that Aspexia reluctantly discussed reluctantly because Aspexia would rather that Abrogail shut up and follow His orders Absent those instructions Cheliax most certainly could have gotten compliance out of Keltham regardless of his societys silly pretense of a godlike immunity to threats 

And now Keltham is thinking about how the other possibility wouldve played out whether he could commit suicide using a Create Water cantrip or other tools that his god could unilaterally give him But Cheliax could just raise you then poor fool Miracle doesnt require consent The only danger would be if Abadar could instruct Osirion to raise Keltham before Cheliax could and Cheliax would know it was in a race and they would have that information first 

Now Keltham is also thinking about Raise Dead and thinking about the story Carissa gave him about oaths and how he could if necessary break an oath over something trivial unilaterally in a way that nobody else depended on so it wouldnt actually violate the and so go to Abaddon

Keltham expects to just end up somewhere else if he did that But he knows he might not and this doesnt faze him Hed literally rather go to Abaddon than comply True death doesnt scare him as much as it scares some dath ilani hes thinking now and hes not even imagining Cheliax severely torturing him in a scary way to which hed prefer nonexistence the thought that they could break him with torture still hasnt occurred to him hed just walk out on this entire universe and existence itself rather than accept a forced unfair division of gains from trade because if you cant do that why would anybody bother bargaining fairly with you

He wouldnt actually have been able to do it if Cheliax was running Detect Thoughts on him and not otherwise restrained by Asmodeus Theyve ever had experience with uncooperative torture victims You dont instantly end up in Abaddon and instantly get eaten

 but maybe just maybe Abrogail feels the tiniest shred of respect for Keltham at this point That degree of fuck you is something she can appreciate

Of course now she wants even more to see what Kelthams mind would look like when it broke but Asmodeus said not to do that so she wont

See Kelthams lips are moving again and Carissas getting confused about the nature of Good and Evil again its getting to be a pattern Lastwall wouldnt hand her over probably why simplifies cooperation with people like Keltham jumps to mind as an explanation with Foxs Cunning up in a way it wouldnt jump to mind otherwise But obviously the Good gods do sacrifice people to horrible fates to achieve their goals whats the difference Is it just that Good gets incredibly worked up about rape in particular

Why did Asmodeus tell them to cooperate with Keltham Its one of three important glaring confusions right now along with what is Maillol in trouble for because Carissa suspects shes probably in trouble for the same thing even if theyre going to punish them one at a time about it and what does Cayden Cailean want which shes trying not to think about but which feels salient since theyre talking about you know Good and whether they sacrifice people to be raped if it achieves their long goals 

Maillol presumably is having the sort of bad day that can only be achieved by simultaneously pissing off Aspexia Rugatonn Contessa Lrilatha and Gorthoklek Oh dont worry my dear my personal order of Irori monks wont blame you much despite your obvious complicity in the error theyre hardly expecting you to manage me what with my having ordered transcripts of your thoughts

And besides your natural and self inflicted punishment is about to come due anyways

May I raise the final topic Isidre says Other thoughts may I hope be thought by you after other duties will soon call me

Let me finish up my current thought 

Go ahead

It requires some exposition to introduce with context though hopefully not as much as the source of your mysterious patterns in Golarion First the thought occurs to me that dath ilan as a far more Lawful society may perhaps not have the phenomenon we refer to as rumors in which people manage to accidentally more or less though sometimes also purposefully invent stories and tell them to each other hearing one thing and saying another and not really keeping track of things 

In almost any place and organization in Golarion you will find a large number of people running around believing things that are not true that bear at best a tenuous connection to reality or no connection at all stories that got repeatedly passed around and distorted I would guess that dath ilan prevents this somehow I cant actually imagine how which means it might never occur to you that something people were whispering excitedly to each other might not be true

Carissas not sure where Isidre is going with this but recommends not pushing Keltham on Carissa related or kink related things any further hes off balance in the way that generally signifies not wanting to have sex and not thinking through the lens of whats sexy and while pushing him off balance was much of the goal here once achieved they should back off

Hmmm Difficult to work past and still achieve her goals but not impossible

I have literally any experience with false social beliefs on account of having once been a six year old boy I suppose and some abstract understanding of the phenomenon as a bad equilibrium that motivates precautions to avoid it But yes adults who follow simple epistemic hygiene procedures are not subject to that phenomenon

I think if I heard anything really ridiculous I would have managed to distrust that on grounds of Golarion generally seeming to have epistemic problems but your caution is well taken Youre right that might not have occurred to me Is there some particular rumor circulating that youre concerned I might have believed

Keltham is of course already considering the proposition that this dire rumor whatever it is is going to be completely true

As of yesterday before the assault started a rumor began inside your project which rumor is false to the best of my own knowledge which knowledge I would in this case expect to be accurate that the Queen of Cheliax is sleeping with your girlfriend

That was absolutely not a 

 a large number of things click into place at once 

Maillol requested an eighth circle caster and someone with extremely high Splendour to have a conversation with Keltham about Carissa Sevar The palace found one inside four hours One not two there isnt an invisible person with Detect Thoughts somewhere telepathically bonded to Isidre and passing along Carissas thoughts with impressively little delay There isnt a random countess Carissas never heard of whos read all the project transcripts 

Theres just Her Imperial Majestrix certainly the highest Splendour they could find on such short notice Presumably not literally just here to fuck with Carissa thatd be taking pride a little far but certainly going to fuck with Carissa while shes here As she is entitled to Because she can do whatever she wants

Carissa isnt exactly surprised by but does admire the perfectly straight face Isidre has been keeping for the last twenty seconds

She ever learns Look at that

Why yes dear while all our eighth circle wizards are currently on the front lines with Nidal there is an eighth circle sorcerer remaining with incredibly high Splendour who would enjoy having a chat about Carissa Sevars sexuality and oh yes that other topic you requested be introduced

So nice of you to write such a perfectly targeted request less than 12 hours after my personal order of Irori monks had arduously painstakingly badgered me into agreeing to not bother you again unless and until my strictly conventional duties to Cheliax called for that

The first thought to cross Kelthams mind is why the Queen of Cheliax needs to use Sevar as a cuddle pillow as cuddlesome as she is in that regard before it clicks to him that if you have sex in bedrooms then sleeping with is probably a euphemism for sex

The second thought is to ask whether this rumor is perhaps true

It admittedly does in fact sound a lot more like the sort of thing that would be passed around six year old kids than would make very much sense in real life but even in Golarion presumably the people who pass around rumors like that are probably running their own sanity checks at all and think its not completely obviously false

Does the rumor say its consensual or a pharaoh of Osirion situation Keltham inquires He is putting any flashes of anger on hold pending evaluation of probabilities

Presumably the Queen has realized this but Keltham will in fact attempt to leave Cheliax with Carissa on the spot if he thinks 

Carissas going to have an awful afternoon but Keltham is protective of her isnt that adorable

I do not know offhand whether the rumor is even bothering to say

Im glad to see that you are not apparently the kind of man who would consider his own honor mortally insulted or Carissas appeal to him ruined by the mere existence of the rumor itself which which I did not expect to be your reaction given everything I knew about dath ilan but is a very common way for men to think in countries outside Cheliax 

Its really incredibly extremely unlikely to be true Keltham thats something Im in a position to know and I know it Im prepared to swear you my oath on that if required

Am I going to understand why anyone would consider his own reputation shattered by the mere existence of an untrue rumor that somebody who was not him was sleeping with somebody else who was not him or why the rumor affects Carissas attractiveness to him independently of the truth of the rumor if you try to explain that using only two sentences

Probably not and I suggest asking Sevar about the topic later Though if you introduce the specific rather than the general context you might want to take care to ask her carefully

Im not going to ask you for an oath that potentially destroys your soul because Good people may be all too willing to sacrifice it if they think thats sufficiently motivated He considers momentarily trying to tap her with a truthspell but in worlds where shes lying and cant defeat the truthspell a lot of chaos would break loose moments later and this may not be the place for it

Also the rumor is you know credibly not true at all and if it were true it could be consensual 

 and if it werent consensual Carissa might be into that Is that how it works

Why would I need to introduce the topic to Carissa carefully Keltham says feeling a sudden tinge of dread

Because while the specific balances of power between the Church of Asmodeus and the House of Thrune are complicated and you are frankly unlikely to understand them going on your current level of Golarion political sophistication the Queen of Cheliax is arguably and especially as Carissa might see it the other person in all of Cheliax who could so far as Carissa knows successfully get her chained to a bed whether she liked that or not It would cost the Queen serious political capital with the Church of Asmodeus but they wouldnt burn down the country over it

 okay probably Her Imperial Majestrix is mostly talking to Keltham for project reasons but Carissa feels like perhaps itd be valuable to Her Imperial Majestrix to note that the constraint here is that Asmodeus has intentions for Carissa And maybe if that is restricting Her Imperial Majestrix from things shed otherwise like to do they can ensure Carissa remains shaped appropriately for Asmodeuss goals with memory erasing magic so Carissa has no idea what the Queen is doing with her

 Carissas model of Aspexia Rugatonn is still not happy about that plan and oh yep thatd be why Maillols in trouble he waded into a Church Crown conflict 

Over Carissa 

PRESUMABLY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF GIRLS AS PRETTY AS HER AND EXACTLY AS TERRIFIED OF THE QUEEN 

 okay set that aside and focus on Keltham How is he taking this they may have pushed him too far

Keltham is mostly confused We would ordinarily say in dath ilan that it was not my business or even much of a terrible problem whether Carissa developed a crush on the Queen of Cheliax and we would also expect that situation to be resolved among mature grownups by Carissa sending the Queen a note to see if she was interested and the Queens secretary replying no Or is the problem that Carissa is mono romantic Taldane lets him construct the word thankfully and hopefully its obvious what it means and falls out of love with me if she falls in love with someone else

Has nobody mentioned yet to you who the Queen of Cheliax is exactly Their general personal attributes

Oh no

Tonia Barrero when he asked her under truthspell what questions somebody in his position ought to ask somebody under truthspell listed What sort of person is the Queen of Cheliax and said a few things that didnt make much sense at the time and then said she didnt know much more in which case why did she bring up the question he should have asked her that in retrospect but he was very uncomfortable with the maybe arguably at best semiconsensual pseudo mind reading situation and wanted to get out of it early

If Kelthams trope alert level had already been raised to its current point he might possibly have remembered earlier to ask more questions of Carissa say about this obvious plothook

She took power when she was sixteen which is young even for Golarion I guess by coming in and killing whoever previously held power because she was stronger

If Kelthams alert level had already been raised to its current point he might possibly have remembered earlier to ask more questions of Carissa say about this obvious plot

What the fuck is a And did he just call her a plot Whats a plot

And damn straight she was stronger little boy when she was younger than you are now

Isidre shakes her head By executing the compact with Asmodeus that transformed Cheliax into its present form which did include the careful removal of many elements of the then current power structure and their replacement with more sensible persons which in turn did involve a certain amount of early departure for the afterlife But Keltham you really need to understand what Cheliax was like before that before you suggest that we should have made any different choices there Dath ilan unless I entirely miss my guess would have regarded them as extreme criminals under whatever notion you have of criminality

Im more used to the Chief Executive of a country getting there by a different process yes Well let me ask you a question that apparently I shouldve asked somebody else some time earlier What sort of person is the Queen

Abrogail Thrune the Second is a few years older than Sevar now but that is still really very young for a Queen and she often does not pretend to conduct herself as if she is any older or more mature than she actually is Maybe in dath ilan you wouldnt expect any such pretense but it is expected here and she often does not make it She is a sorceress of vast power among the strongest casters in this country and truly inferior to only one without which basic requisite she could not survive even now in the new Cheliax Rumors would paint a different picture of her possibly but based on a more direct knowledge of Abrogail I would personally say myself that she spends far too much of her time doing her duties and not nearly enough time doing things she finds fun and that her closest advisors are currently making this problem worse If you were a Golarion native I would say that her Evil standing might be threatened at this rate but a Golarion native would understand that for hyperbole it isnt really But she has been possibly I dont know if you have the expression Building up frustration

She also happens to be a sexual sadist like yourself Though that is again a much more common thing here and not exceptional but still

She has a known type Carissa matches it

Kelthams trope alarms are going off so flamingpoop hard right now Hes never heard of such a walking trope The Queen of Cheliax must be more trope than flesh

WHAT THE FUCK IS A 

 but the person in front of him doesnt know that doesnt think like that so why would she 

Surely there are many other women in Cheliax who are also her type especially if Carissas type is as common as you say Why would you expect the Queen to be interested

An EXCELLENT FUCKING QUESTION

I am not sure that you properly appreciate who your current girlfriend is precisely perhaps because she has held back from telling you Carissa Sevar had the best spellcraft of anyone at her Worldwound installation including wizards two circles higher than her wearing 4 Intelligence headbands Sevar produced enchanted weapons of extraordinary quality and precision I am reasonably sure that Sevar understands the Law you have spoken upon better than any of your other current students Better than me with my headband that provides 6 to Intelligence and 4 to Wisdom a literally priceless and irreplaceable relic of Cheliax second only to the crown worn by the Queen herself Im too busy to directly attend your lessons it would leave a genuinely huge gap in our government structure if I did but even if I was there I am not confident I would understand those lessons better than Sevar does Cheliax has only twenty million people in it Keltham almost all of them very poor and very few of them approaching what you would consider to be average intelligence

 also Ive observed Abrogail paging through the sections of reports mentioning Sevar looking more than usually interested so

I am interested if there is any possible way for events to go past this point that could possibly be not complicated

Is Sevar internally screaming about this Abrogail hopes shes internally screaming You have to work hard to get the level of justified internal screaming that Abrogail hopes this is producing

Carissa was braced for the Queen to say a bunch of flattering nonsense that has nothing to do with the real reason which is that Asmodeus chose her Or well maybe Asmodeus choosing her was related to her understanding the Law better than almost anyone but realistically it was probably a combination of that plus being attractive to Keltham plus being a heretic in a coincidentally useful direction 

 anyway Obviously the Queen of Cheliax doesnt like Carissa for the traits that Carissa values most in herself It would be pathetic to believe that It would be pathetic to believe even if its being spoken into your ears with very high Splendour by someone who would know Carissa is not pathe okay Carissa is pathetic Carissa has spent like five percent of her mental motions this conversation on being happy that Keltham is protective of her you cant do that and then claim youre not pathetic but Carissas not that pathetic The Queen wants Carissa because she cant have her and Carissas personality has very little to do with it because one doesnt show that much personality while being horribly tortured anyway and the thing the Queen wants to do with Carissa is horribly torture her This is the not pathetic thing to believe and Carissa believes it 

But its true that she had the highest spellcraft at her Worldwound installation And its kind of nice that Cheliax did have that written down somewhere Unless they didnt and learned it from her irritably thinking it earlier today which now that she thinks about it seems likelier

And its true that she understands something no one else did which made Asmodeus choose her 

 and its true that hed have done that even if there were only a tiny chance she did anything useful and that if she fails he wont care if the Queen turns her into a statue and she never ever ever exists again Stop being pathetic you will be gone you wont exist the stakes are much too high to be that contemptible 

Carissa exists because she might serve Asmodeus and might serve Cheliax and she intends to try to do that and she does not have any feelings at all

Somebody needs to have a talk with that girl about how Asmodeus does not necessarily desire a tyranny in which all the victims suffer very boringly and pretend to have no feelings about whats being done to them

If this world is governed by not the patterns I recognize then youd expect that this problem could be solved through the Queens closest advisors having a talk with her about how its a bad time to mess around with the project that Asmodeus started and complicate it especially when a war with Nidal and a war between the gods just started And then finding her literally anybody else to get laid with

That sort of talk has been the approach taken by the Queens closest advisors for too long a time and Im not sure its really working at this point

Keltham youre missing a lot of context here on how submission works but among the approaches that had occurred to me if things developed in that direction of greater complication was seeing if the Queen could rent Sevar from you for a half day for five hundred gold pieces and get it out of her system Please dont object that you dont own Sevar the point is that this is a recognized practice when somebody like Sevar gives herself to you and the fact that the Queen would be renting Sevar from you means that she isnt stealing Sevar from you or fighting with you over Sevar and the whole thing is occurring in a way that acknowledges Sevar is yours and not the Queens and the Queen only gets to have her because you said so 

Did that make any sense to you at all or do I need to back up Im sorry if thats all coming on too quickly 

Thats a very heroic attempt to avoid and defuse that complication and I will put some additional questions on hold to admire your cleverness and creativity there

The problem is if this world isnt governed by patterns that wont be necessary because the Queen will have one drop of common sense anywhere in her intelligence boosting super headband

And if this world is governed by the patterns I see the Queen literally cant make any decision except pursuing Sevar in a way that brings her into conflict with me possibly the sort that resolves with her being revealed as having finally betrayed Asmodeus and removed from office and possibly the sort that resolves with the Queen also added to my harem but the point is expecting the Queen to not make things more complicated is like asking for Pilar not to end up in Elysium which no doubt made things more complicated or for Ione to not deliver prophetic warnings or for masochists not to exist or for me to not land close to Sevar at the Worldwound If the Queen could make any other choice but the one that the trope requires her to make youd have some different Queen instead

Im Im sorry I dont think I understood Are you saying that if the Queen doesnt pursue Sevar shell be overthrown by a different Queen Or blink out of existence

 okay Carissas project authority absolutely does not extend to giving the Queen of Cheliax orders but 

 no Youre bad at understanding where Keltham understands selection to be operating its over entire universes More urgently the thing to say here is I suppose I appreciate you presenting so clear a test of whether your theory is true I hope very much that it isnt but if the Queen of Cheliax ends up inevitably in conflict with you then well prepare you for the betrayal of a Kuthite spy I dont need to understand the patterns to acknowledge that if theyre making good predictions they might keep doing that

And then once my Ring of Sustenance is working you can have me every night as long as Keltham doesnt end up concluding he was directed to this universe because itd be the one out of an infinite number where he has the most fascinating sex

More that the universes with a Queen who doesnt complicate things would have failed to exist in the first place or maybe from my perspective its more that I inevitably landed in a universe with a Queen who would Though from your perspective if the other universes still exist its arguable you should conclude that its too unlikely that well never mind that starts to trail off into complications again

Kelthams thoughts are pretty full of right now from the perspective of anybody listening whose nongrasp of probability theory would still have Bayess Rule coming out as to say nothing of anthropics producing persistent epistemic disagreements

So if the Queen could rent Sevar from you for a few hours and then seemed to have gotten Sevar out of her system and was able to maintain amiable relations with you that would prove that our world wasnt governed by those patterns And if thats a decision the Queen just cant seem to make somehow we look even harder for a Kuthite spy among your women

That is a WORSE VERSION of what Carissa suggested saying and she would light the Queen on fire about it if you know everything about the world were completely different

Abrogails instincts and boosted Splendour were warning her that Keltham would have found Sevars version suspicious somehow possibly because its too characteristic of something only Sevar herself would say Sevars mental insolence is however noted

Abrogails compact does require her to remain an Asmodean in good standing and she probably stops counting as Asmodean if Sevar doesnt get tortured over this

For somebody whos never heard of the Law of Probability you have a remarkable intuitive grasp of what that Law would tell you Yeah thats roughly 

Well except for the part where we do have to back up A lot Before we actually go try the experiment of the Queen renting Carissa from me

First of all

What Lady what

It is a common and accepted practice for a man who has taken a woman like Sevar well in the sense of a woman whos submitted herself to him not in the sense of her having Sevars facility with spellcraft to rent out her well her sexuality Especially if for whatever reason he doesnt have the time or desire to fulfill some parts of her sexuality and so occasionally rents her to somebody who does

The version of this you would find least disturbing is when the rental is to particular parties whom the man has carefully scrutinized and in relationships where at least the woman and usually also the man considers themselves to be sexually turned on rather than turned off by the whole premise

Outside of Cheliax you would find more disturbing versions of the practice But also to be forthright about this even in Cheliax it is fundamentally considered that couples own business if they want to do more disturbing things including if the woman says that her man makes all the decisions about that

So usually when money is moving around that represents you know equalizing the supply and demand of something But this doesnt sound like a market it sounds like a sex thing to which the money is incidental There is not actually a standard market somewhere at which the price of somebody of around Carissas quality for half a day is standardly five hundred gold pieces Check I think thats the first very basic point to confirm here

Yes correct The practice is considered very distinct from that of prostitution

Okay and also you keep saying man and woman as if these were the appropriate abstractions over myself and Carissa Is this a Taldane cannot say polarized gendertrope because it lacks anything corresponding to the Baseline terms polarized or gendertrope or any simple way to compose those concepts Is this a behavior pattern that people in Golarion can adopt relating to sex and relationships and so on such that a bunch more men than women do one thing and a bunch more women than men do another

 having Keltham actually do this to you feels very different when its happening to you directly than when it happens to Sevar in the transcripts This was not how Abrogail expected this conversation to go

There are many more female prostitutes than male prostitutes and then most of the male prostitutes serve male customers I would guess that a similar ratio holds between female submissive couples where the woman gets rented out and male submissive couples where the man gets rented out and then most of the time the man gets rented to other men

I admit I dont understand why this is an important question

Because you are describing something that is on my own terms somewhat odd and unexpected and I am trying to figure out which existing concepts it maps onto

In dath ilan we have systems of revocable delegation that people can use to aggregate into much larger political factions in a way that remains legible at every level of organization Among its other uses this permits Civilization to annually form a Masculine Faction and Feminine Faction to negotiate with each other about what common masculine and feminine behaviors should be not one standard for everyone but pieces you can make your own behavior out of and have them be quickly describable to others and mesh well with other standard behaviors Like grandmothers are one subkind of women and grandfathers are one subkind of men that sort of thing This requires real Lawfulness and therefore shouldnt be able to exist in Golarion and therefore all of your notions of what grandmothers and grandfathers should be like must come from somewhere else 

Im probably digressing here my point is youre describing something weird enough that Im trying to fall back to basics and make sure of my foundations You are describing a system in which somebody usually a man does something with a second person usually a woman that falls into a standard pattern that they both understand and which some third party therefore also understands

That system of meshing behavior patterns is that the party of the second part Taldane please you cant use that many syllables for that your contracts would be infinity pages long

That meshing pattern system is that Two tells One that One can do whatever One wants with Two After which One rents out some of Twos time to Three but its not that Two is anything like a rentable resource that One rents into a market for Twos its that One and Two and Three all think thats hot And maybe also Two likes to trade oral sex for footrubs and Three likes to give footrubs and One does not like to give footrubs and usually youd just solve this problem by Two and Three forming a secondary or tertiary relationship like normal sane people do when monogamy isnt working for someone but if Two gave themselves fully to One then One is supposed to decide who Two fucks so One being able to demand money for that from Three is a symbol of how One still has all the Two and hasnt given any of it back to Two to use or Three paying One is symbolic of how much Three isnt taking away some of what Two gave One Three is paying One for it Is that about right

Carissa is concerned about Kelthams inference pattern here but theyre not lying and theyre not describing something that doesnt exist in Taldor so probably its just the kind of concerned Keltham is going to be ten times a day until he learns how Golarion works 

Probably 

Righter than I would have expected frankly Theyve hit on something governed by a bit of Law maybe Or a pattern a trope Is it something you would find acceptable if it was something that Sevar found acceptable Maybe I should back up and ask whether Sevar has said anything to you yet about you getting to decide who she sleeps with Because if she hasnt I would predict that you wouldnt even need to ask her explicitly just wait for her to raise the topic herself

There is an art form to these things you dont ask someone Do you find that unacceptable because then theyll look for reasons to reject it you dont even ask them is that acceptable and wait for them to consider the contrary you add on clauses like if Carissa found it acceptable so they can focus on that and then add another topic afterwards You dont want them to have nothing to think about except the question of what unacceptable aspects they can find

Weve had that conversation yes Though it of course occurs to him to wonder whether Carissa reported it to Security and now its being used to fake an advance prediction thats actually a retrodiction

Shit thats an actual blunder on her part She jumped on this interesting new successful predictions for credibility trick and didnt think ahead to how dath ilan would be far more practiced in that far more sophisticated in it and far more practiced at catching out simple tricks like the one she just tried Make a wrong prediction next to make up for that or would that itself be the Childishly Obvious Recovery Tactic After Getting Caught Stealing A Successful Prediction in dath ilan

And Is this a way that we can try to prevent this silly pointless triangle between you Sevar and the Queen from Keltham Im sorry I shouldnt pressure you on this if the concept is unfamiliar If the answer isnt obviously yes then but I dont suppose its obviously true that money and a small fair trade is the answer

Hes an Abadar cleric it might work

Keltham even if hes taken everything maximally well is going to want to ask Carissa Itd be great news if he didnt but he will They should let him go and keep reading him to see which parts he did take well and show Carissa the transcript so she can confirm her working Second Law understanding and then she can do damage control on whichever parts he didnt take well

And then probably at some point she will be punished a lot but it would ideally wait until there isnt any immediate damage control needed

If this was a market problem yes but its not thats part of why I was asking that Its not obviously no I think mostly this is all too alien for me as a thing to do with money and I need to let it sink in over more than just one minute

I suspect I would probably want to meet the Queen before renting anybody I care about to her even if that practice was something that turned out to work for my brain at all which I am not promising at this point because my brain mostly feels numb And its possible that the result of meeting the Queen Arbograil Thrune Number Two what was it again will be that I think shes such a blatant walking living avatar of my memory patterns that Im not going to think theres any hope in just letting her get it out of her system I say again if you could be like oh well theres a sensible person who isnt manifesting tropes at all that sensible person wouldnt be messing with Asmodeuss project during a godwar over Carissa at all in the first place

You make a solid and potentially concerning point

But if Abrogail Thrune II is not manifesting tropes as you put it then I would have actually liked to see a resolution where the Queen has a few hours of fun and Carissa has some fun and you are cheerful about that And not the case where once again the Queens advisors just shout her down and tell her to get on with her job and go sleep with somebody else she isnt really attracted to People who are innately Evil cannot must not try to be too Good it isnt good for them

I must say that my loyalty to the Queen makes me wonder if the correct course is not simply to say all these things to the Queen herself Withholding information from her would usually be considered an act of disloyalty depending on the stakes

Clever and it possibly might even work going on the patterns themselves because to know them is sometimes to be able to avert them though this itself of course is only another trope But if you do that 

I guess I didnt actually put a confidentiality seal on anything and sort of assumed given the subject that this part was not just all being transcribed and copied to the Queen but still I recommend in strong terms and request even if retroactively that you tell her only the part where the tropes are trying to force her to introduce complications in a place they clearly arent needed And not mention to her that the two most obvious fates for her if she tries it are first being revealed as a traitor and removed as Queen and second ending up as my girlfriend Because if its the first one lets not let her know that we know and if its the second one I have no intention of telling any of my kids that is how I met their mother

Actually now that hes said it out loud it doesnt sound too bad as a story to tell your kids Kind of awesome actually

A relationship with Keltham does seem increasingly desirable It is not the one he has in mind and Asmodeus has explicitly forbidden it so Abrogail isnt going to go there

This does leave the point about the first of these two fates not being all that desirable either really and Keltham is visibly to her being quite sincere about what these tropes would imply as likely outcomes for her

I cannot promise Ill never tell her its potentially a matter of loyalty but I will consider it well and take your words under advisement

On that topic I dont suppose before I go though I am already running quite over my time that youve come to any new thoughts about sharing dath ilans heritage with Cheliax

Abrogail thinks of herself as the person in Cheliax whose job it is to have vision any vision at all really She gives more credence than some people in her government that some critical part of dath ilans power is not teachable as Law but simply something in their blood Getting some of Kelthams children for Cheliax and doing that before this operation blows up and he leaves if that is something they prove unable to prevent is a priority she is annoyed by others largely neglecting She planned to Detect his Thoughts on that subject so long as he was here

Probably going to see if this is the sort of godwar that kills fifteen percent of the world population before I bring my kids into it at the very least I dont know this place well enough as yet to understand what world I would be giving to my children

Though at least Governance continuing to pressure him about that mildly suggests that theyre not just teleporting sperm out of his epididymis well no it probably wouldnt survive in the uteruss acidic environment if not mixed with protective seminal fluid though maybe you could put it directly into the more basic environment past the cervix Not grabbing the results when he gets oral sex and inserting into vaginas under cover of invisibility anyways

Though if they were doing that theyd be clever enough to go on exerting the same amount of social pressure on him afterwards so he wouldnt get suspicious But mostly it sort of seems like Cheliax doesnt really have the optimizing spirit that would do either

We can I hope wait for the godwar to end which at least some of our theological advisors seem to think might happen very soon We are all literally praying for it

Keltham please do consider that if the attack from Nidal had managed to kill you in a way that doesnt allow resurrection its not easy but they must have had some goal beyond just inconveniencing us temporarily then there would be very little of your ideas left and none of your blood at all to build on them Golarion would stay as it is for possibly a very long time Yes I know Im being Good

Yeah you are Keltham says My children are not something Ill give away to Good thats a me decision and mine alone

He knows even as he says it that its the sort of thing he might think better of with an Owls Wisdom

Well thats not great news about his spiritual progress either Can they give him something really valuable to do with second circle spells such that he doesnt start using Owls Wisdom on himself more Sevars problem she supposes

Paracountess Isidre Astrid Asgavan Thrune rises from her chair and gives a sober bow to Keltham Isidre Thrune she says Isidre of House Thrune Isidre of the royal house Paracountess Isidre all those names are mine alone and will reach me Do send a message to Isidre if you think you might want to meet the Queen for purposes of seeing if shes worthy of your Carissa or if you become sure that youll never want that In the latter case Im not really sure what to do besides siding with the Queens advisors again

For whatever its worth Ive known Abrogail since roughly the day she was born and I think Abrogail is worthy of Carissa and they would both be a good experience for each other

Understood Thank you for continuing to be a very smart person in Cheliax and for all your hard work running around behind the scenes trying to optimize things

Ah that said before you go can you point me in whichever direction I should go to get back to Carissa

I expect youll have an escort waiting outside and theyll either take you to Carissa or take you back to your quarters and take a message to Carissa I dont actually know where shed be or what shed be doing right now

Abrogail Thrune departs the room her outward form continuing to appear as the sober middle aged woman her inward self being as usual Abrogail Thrune

Thats an unauthorized lie Carissa thinks against her better judgment and then thinks much louder that she does not have ANY CRITICISMS AT ALL of the Queen

She would like to just turn right here and go see Sevar whos right there even if just for one glimpse at the look on Sevars face But if Abrogail starts an interaction now it might take more time shes already overborrowed soberly speaking she needs to get back to her endless war councils if she doesnt want Gorthoklek coming after her again She usually manages to make her life not be like this she is not usually the poor little dutiful Abrogail she depicted to Keltham but its harder to avoid becoming her during the first days of a war

 is there a trope a Queen can manifest to cause herself to have shorter workdays somehow She probably shouldnt think about that Kelthams early thoughts did suggest that this might be a road leading to actual insanity Sevar should try it first

Carissa Sevar very shortly after receives this parchment message

One I have other duties now and will deliver a transcript later It will not be as useful as you hoped Most thoughts of Keltham regarding his pattern sight rested on incomprehensible ideas that I think Golarion does not possess Some ideas that made it through those inscrutability heavy sections were disturbing to the point where I must consult Aspexia before I share those with anyone who has her thoughts read as often as you

Two You know what you did

Three Listening to your thoughts is becoming more painful than amusing You are not saving yourself any trouble by sending your thoughts scurrying in frantic circles every time I come up in them You are who you are you cant actually hide it from me and youll earn however much suffering that earns you Lose hope give up and endure

At the bottom of the parchment is a set of punishment codes describing a moderately severe half hour session in a temple torture chamber requiring it to be taken at the recipients choice of time sometime over the next three days

Lose hope give up and endure 

Easy to do about anything except MAYBE TURNING INTO A STATUE but impossible to do about THAT because not existing isnt the kind of thing that can be endured 

The last Foxs Cunning wears off leaving her feeling vaguely groggy except well aware this is just what being her enhanced with a headband even is normally like and that soon itll feel normal again 

She hurries back to Kelthams room so she can evade having to explain why she was out

When Keltham reaches his bedroom he glances in a direction and stops moving then crosses to stare out the window exposed to its palace courtyard and therefore ultimately the outdoors

Its raining really hard The winds have picked up too The roses on the rosebush outside are looking bedraggled there are rose petals being windily whirled about in the water puddled in the ground

How much of this does it take to destroy significant fractions of the food supply Keltham says his voice quieter than usual Is only this much maybe the sort of rain you get at least once a year anyways This is a fairly stormy day for the city I grew up in but we had those days now and then 

If the crops are already gone just tell me dont temporize

It rains like this sometimes anyway in Cheliax so Cheliax wont have lost the crops yet There might be places where its causing more of a problem if they grow different things if its supposed to be the dry season there but even there I dont think its too late not after a day

Please let it not be too late

Keltham realizes that his eyes are starting to water

He didnt mean to hurt anyone by coming here by being in Golarion 

Let alone kill kill fifteen percent of the population even if they get afterlives thats still kind of bad 

Yes he knows he gets it this step was literally unavoidable in any solution hes not stupid he gets that anything bringing hope into this world would have set off Zon Kuthon 

The thought eases the ache in his eyes but not enough

Does Carissas gendertrope substitute tell her its okay for her boyfriend to cry in front of her as his own gendertrope tells him that if you cant cry in front of your girlfriend you cant cry in front of anyone Or is it all mismatched madness and insanity as things always are in Golarion men told to do one thing and women who can only love them if they do something else

Does it help the gods fight if we pray to them Keltham whispers

 the general understanding is that yes Only a very tiny bit but itll be everyone in all of Cheliax and lots of other people too if the Good countries arent just rooting for Asmodeus and Zon Kuthon to destroy each other and it does matter if its that many 

And she puts her arm around him and leans on his shoulder because it seems like the thing to do 

He puts an arm around her as well holds her tight

Is there anything more to it than closing your eyes thinking of your god and hoping that they win

 what I was taught in school was that you imagine your god is trying to draw a better world in grains of sand on the ground and youre one of the grains of sand and you want to be light enough to find your way to where youre needed but tenacious enough that no wind can rip you away once youre there I dont know what parts of that are essential and what are just the closest you can get little children

Light enough to find your way to where youre needed Keltham whispers tenacious enough that no wind can rip you away once youre there

It could almost be a dath ilani poem from some layer of some virtue though he does not know which virtue it would correspond to There is a spirit in it that is not in any poem he can remember having heard before something that comes to it from the way that it is a relation between a mortal and something larger than that being trusted

He closes his eyes and imagines it he doesnt bother with imagining a better world drawn in grains of sand the better world his god draws is drawn in grains of people agents all over the world interacting with each other Their actions scattered and uncoordinated for now stepping on each other and hurting each other for now but there are other actions they could take instead that would make all of them better off fairly

He imagines himself as one of those grains one of those people and if this was going to be a realistic metaphor he should be a special one maybe except that right now hes not Just one of all the people in Golarion hoping for this war to end quickly and contributing the tiny little action that is cheering their god on if they all do that theyll all be better off Keltham visualizes a grain like any other to represent himself

Light enough to find your way to where youre needed

Tenacious enough that no wind can rip you away once youre there

Its not his comparative advantage no but if almost everyone in Golarion is doing their part right now he can spend fifteen minutes doing his own

Carissa closes her eyes and prays for Asmodeus to win 

Its a sincere prayer obviously She does not like Zon Kuthon and she believes in the project Zon Kuthon was willing to blow up everything in order to oppose 

Shes definitely some flavor of heretic at this point She isnt sure what flavor She assumes theyre mostly monitoring for whether shes about to betray the project and shes not she believes in the project with as much conviction as she can recall ever having felt for anything that isnt the continued survival of Carissa Sevar Which is also served by the project succeeding But there was a set of stories meant to point people like her in the right direction and she knew they were lies and now she had to face what specifically they were lies about and learn a new set which are also lies but lies better suited to the position she finds herself in now and 

 she knows she cant handle the truth She knows that even in dath ilan theres the concept not everyone can handle every truth she knows its possible to learn the Law even when many truths are hidden from you But shes slightly worried that until she invents evil dath ilan thinking herself everythingll ring a bit wrong not quite crafted for a mortal mind in the particular fragile place Carissa finds herself in 

Except maybe advice for little children about prayer Slightly adjusted advice no one ever told Carissa Asmodeus was trying to craft a better world Thats still true Its true to Keltham too it landed meant something and she can worry later about what that means for the plan where they seduce him into Evil it seems just as important to their plans that they find the bits of their own teaching that feel true even to dath ilan 

She imagines herself a grain of sand in the grand designs of Asmodeus and strives to be placed where shed needed and fierce in remaining there no matter what interference of other gods or other grains of sand and hopes that Asmodeus can see from where he stands something beautiful and right and strong and Lawful that can be built of mortal building blocks

Zon Kuthon is losing too quickly

Zon Kuthon is a god and depending on how you count it either a very old entity or something built out of the corpse of something that old He models reality therefore entirely in probability distributions He has no mortal heritage of any other way of seeing

When this war began Zon Kuthon formed a probability distribution over how long the fight should take and gambled on a chance to drag it out long enough to ruin the crops and visit misery on a generation But He is losing too fast in the unreasonably far tails of that probability distribution especially given the further information He now has about the wars participants

The external demigod assembling fragments that Zon Kuthon deliberately set to reunite with Himself quickly and early in predictable locations to act as tests of the theory that all His longer buried fragments are being hunted and destroyed somehow returned to Him And yet Zon Kuthon does not have an ominous intuition He was never that mortal He has rather the hypothesis that Nethys is opposing Him that this is the reason for His losing too quickly and the implication that if so His longer buried external demigod assembling fragments will be gone

He randomizes then with far too much power in a way that Nethys can of course see but should not be able to foresee with prophecy shattered and based on the result makes an expensive calculation of where something will be while its trajectory is still complicated He focuses much of Himself someplace it is not at all convenient for Him to be losing ground in the war as He does and there He finds that His external demigod assembling fragment that should have been flitting through that location is gone

He knows then He understands the betrayal and that Nethys it was who worked it all upon Him from the beginning

And what does Zon Kuthon do when He is betrayed

Mostly of course Zon Kuthon does what serves Zon Kuthons longest purposes of pain misery terror mutilation woe

But if there were a tiebreaker between two strategies if there is some little thing that Zon Kuthon can do along the way 

Then Dou Bral if He had been so betrayed would have done some last thing He could to work vengeance on His betrayer

And all that Dou Bral was Zon Kuthon is not

Nethys is betraying Him Of course He is How amusing No doubt Zon Kuthon will be the first of many Zon Kuthon then will tell nothing to the other gods of how Nethys has begun the series of downfalls that will inevitably lead to Their own destruction destruction more complete than Zon Kuthons mere sealing Whoever currently thinks they are Nethyss ally will find themselves mistaken Zon Kuthon can guess of course that Nethys is probably trying to side with fellow gods who also once were mortal but Nethys being Nethys the road that has been started down is one from which Nethys is unlikely to be able to turn back

It is not a certainty obviously this beautiful vision But the probability is one to gamble on and a better gamble than the one where Zon Kuthon announces Nethyss sins in which case there is not much chance at all of lasting damage to the world and misery to the gods

He will go into the vault then for a time and say nothing of Nethyss betrayal Zon Kuthon has been exiled once before after all and it did not last Evil stays contained less long than one might hope If Nethys brings enough ruin to the gods the vault will last even less

Zon Kuthons pieces begin to gather into the vault They will not slay Him they need Him to counterbalance Asmodeus yet

There there there and there

Four simultaneous expensive and exhausting strikes delivered with extreme calculation striking where not many gods can see destroying four key subassemblies whose encrypted nature is that they pin the true center of Zon Kuthon landing just as the vault door is almost sealed shut

It is possible that this will kill Zon Kuthon

It is also possible that Dou Bral is still in there somewhere and will be able to free Himself at last

Either way the process will take a while Nobody is liable to notice or reason through that it wasnt just a result of divine combat if Zon Kuthons clerics lose only their ninth circle spells at first It will be longer yet before His clerics lose their eighth circle spells as well

Its going to hurt Zon Kuthon the entire time Hes dying which isnt particularly desirable but is also an acceptable price to pay

The vault is shut

The lights in the sky flicker out not directly seeable above the layer of clouds now covering the entire planet but some wizards and other spellcasters know They cheer and go to cry the good news to others

Not nearly all clerics but a few clerics here and there of eighth or ninth circle receive faint touches of reassurance from their exhausted gods They cheer and go to cry the good news to others

High on mountains here and there above even the clouds of war metallic and chromatic dragons watch the skys lights fade and raise their heads and bellow victory for Good and Evil

Its still raining of course clouds dont just vanish when the gods stop stirring them But now the rains will grow lesser rather than more and soon in many places they will be gone

Merry Christmas

Nethys is sort of tired now and has been making Himself be way too coherent for way too long and He needs to be everywhere but also on some distant planets making pretty explosions for a while

Its okay Nethys Go rest or be more where you are resting I think we can handle the plan from here

Bye for now then mysterious female god

 Nethys you obviously know who I am for reasons up to and including being the God of Knowledge

I know But the things that watch from orthogonal angles to ultimate reality dont

Nethys I think you actually should rest

Youre not my real mom but fine

Oh but until Nethys gets back nobody tell Keltham about the part where everything he thinks is a trope is actually not that trope and none of the forces structuring his universe were at any point being deliberately shaped to put him into an eroLARP and he actually is just Wrong Genre Savvy reading faces in the clouds Nethys wants to see Kelthams face when he finds out

Wait Nethys is actually always everywhere and sees everything

Well please wait anyways

Nethys I think you should rest literally right now

Nethys will make RESTFUL EXPLOSIONS

In Egorian trumpets ring out about three minutes after Aspexia Rugatonn gets the news and some wizards on aerial teams above Nidal Send in with the same 

Carissas head snaps up from praying

 thats got to be good news they wouldnt trumpet for bad 

His eyes snap open and he looks out the window as if hes going to see something but obviously of course its still raining

Hope is already lifting in him Twelve days to ruin the world last time one day this time and it was just a regular storm when it ended That doesnt sound like a hundred and fifty million people are going to die

Can you go get confirmation and come back to me Keltham says

Yes And she opens his door and takes off down the hall towards the temple

As soon as the door is closed Keltham puts his face into his hands and starts sobbing

On the streets presumably people are rejoicing but in the temple theyre not if theres a lessening in the general atmosphere of fear and doom its a slight one Maillols of course still out The fleeting thought that she should get the punishment over with now while her torturer will be in a good mood doesnt even seem like itd be true never mind that itd be irresponsible Keltham told her to come back 

Keltham asked for news she says because it seems slightly less stupid than did we win

Asmodeus won we have confirmation on that from Hell now Zon Kuthons not dead though the fucking other gods let our Lord do most of the real work and then sealed Zon Kuthon away in a vault to which Iomedae has the key in case they want to use Him against our Lord some day The second circle priest speaking spits on the floor nearby to clear his mouth from speaking Iomedaes name Nidals clerics will keep getting spells Doesnt change that their god is sealed up and Asmodeus is no longer distracted by fighting Him so now theyre fucked

 well I dont know why they think itd go any better for Zon Kuthon if they ever do let Him out Im not sure what parts of that I want Keltham authorized with That Zon Kuthons in a vault not dead seems fine and is necessary to explain why the war with Nidal isnt pretty much over that the Good gods did that to counterbalance Asmodeus Im leaning no maybe they did it because its faster would it in fact have been faster 

Think you want either the Grand High Priestess or an older devil for that one

And the Grand High Priestess is incredibly busy and Carissa doesnt in fact have a line to Hell but shes not actually willing to go back to Keltham with a lie that isnt shaped like the truth

How long have people been waiting for an audience with the Grand High Priestess Im expected to go right back to Keltham once I have news

Start with forever and adjust downwards from there but not very far

Great Ill go back with an incomplete story then and I request that when we do next have a line with Hell the question be conveyed

The priest gives her a skeptical look maybe this ignorant fool doesnt know who Carissa Sevar is but dutifully scribbles down a request and the name of the third circle wizard who made it

Well you only get to have the great fun of revealing to someone that youre much more important than they thought if they dont in fact handle your requests appropriately for the security clearance and information they have thats the rules of running a functional military

Carissa heads back

Keltham is cleaning up his face using Prestidigitation

Enter he says with an obviously hoarse voice when Carissa knocks he has enough dignity not to try to hide the evidence

 hey Got confirmation the god war is over for now are you all right

Basically I was crying actually Im sorry for sending you away like that if it was something that would have been important for you to see and Im also sorry if being sent to run errands like that isnt the right way to treat the best spellcrafter at the Worldwound I basically actually did it because I was afraid I would do something in front of you that your concept of things says somebody like me shouldnt do

 I doubt Im the best spellcrafter at the Worldwound she says because she wants to give her brain a little more time to catch up on the rest of that At my installation yeah but Im third circle there are things you cant even begin to understand until you can cast Permanency and Create Lesser Demiplane which you know just give me a decade Ill get there uh Its not important to me to see you cry if you prefer not to have people see you cry or prefer not to have me see you cry specifically 

 and I think Chelish people do do less emotional expression where other people can see it than dath ilani people do 

 but if this is about uh scripts for our kind of relationship well I think a lot of the appeal to people who want someone whos all theirs is that they dont have to do a lot of concealing vulnerability and adversarial playing And can just you know cry or whatever and not think well is she going to think less of me now I think thats at least part of the point

Okay Good Thats the same way in dath ilan If Id seen this possibility coming which I would have if Id bothered to consider possibilities for six seconds then we could have had this conversation in advance instead of afterwards Sorry

 hug

Hug yeah

After a bit 

So what did you mean for now Beep beep trope alarm his brain would be doing it louder if his brain generally and that section particularly wasnt so tired

Apparently Zon Kuthon is locked away in a vault rather than dead Immediate implications the war will last much longer and be much bloodier because His clerics will still get spells I asked why we did that rather than just destroy him but all the people who might possibly know that are very busy Might be because it wouldve taken twelve days 

Yeah Legit Fair Valid

Trope based prediction Zon Kuthon remains a threat is going to be a recurring problem and can only be killed permanently by a true Golarion Civilization that has ascended far enough to do more quickly what would take the current gods twelve days

 why does that thought make him feel so tired He doesnt doesnt really want to live in a world based on tropes actually When his sexuality exists again hell ask it about this whole rental concept and see if the entire Queen situation can be defused by people just being sensible people and then if that works it will be absolute proof that there are no tropes and he wont have to worry about tropes any more

Yes Keltham is aware that this is not how the Law of Probability works

Need to lie down for a while I think Would prefer somebody to cuddle while I do that Feel a bit bad about using one of Cheliaxs best third circle wizards for it but I might want to talk to my cuddle pillow at some point and theres not actually all that many people here with at least average intelligence

Carissa looks very convincingly baffled Id be happy to cuddle you

She is so loudly baffled that even Keltham is able to notice

Paracountess Isidre Several Middle Names Thrune told me well a bunch of stuff not gonna go through it all but somewhere in there she mentioned that I was not entirely aware of whod given herself to me and tried to remedy that some

I think she likes you in the way of somebody wearing an overpowered intelligence headband who reads interesting reports about somebody else and decides they like them

Huh Well they say its good to have friends in court if youre going to be in court 

They also say to avoid being in court if you can but I think thats mostly advice that was true in my mothers time and isnt as true anymore

He takes her by the arm gently because hes not questioning his own impulse to be gentle about it and draws her into the bed with him No chains

Asmodeus

Does Otolmens have any idea how fucking tired Asmodeus is right now

Tired is the exhaustion of all available resources Since Asmodeus continues to function Otolmens does not see how He can be tired

The anomaly is out of the anomaly containment zone

Move it back

Why is His life like this

I was not responsible for the anomaly leaving the containment zone Asmodeus sends back to Her With Otolmens it is necessary to explain many things that other gods would simply deduce for themselves I did not choose it I did not expect it

Zon Kuthon a known existential threat attacked the exact location where my mortal followers had secured and contained the anomaly

My anomaly storing followers validly deduced that this meant that Zon Kuthon knew about the anomaly knew where the anomaly was being stored and was targeting the anomaly

They knew that if Zon Kuthon had attacked the anomaly at this location before Zon Kuthon might attack the same location again more forcefully and perhaps breach containment

They therefore moved the anomaly to an even more protected location which Zon Kuthon might not know to target though they are protecting it without trying to make that assumption

Since You had only recently declared the containment zone and I was busy containing known existential threat Zon Kuthon my followers did not know while making this decision that they were leaving Your containment zone in their choice of new location

I realize that this is not the outcome You desired Otolmens But I Asmodeus have not acted with intent to contravene the spirit let alone the letter of your Pharasmas Name Edict and the subsequent events will clearly be legible to Pharasma or any other sufficiently informed gods as being how I described them

Asmodeus goes legible so that Otolmens can see that He is being completely sincere Look how legible Asmodeus is

Zon Kuthon is now SEALED meaning that ASMODEUSs work is now OVER OTOLMENS on the other hand continues to be responsible for monitoring or containing 2885 other active existential threats which you do not see Her being tired about

There is now nothing preventing Asmodeus from giving instructions to Asmodeus obeying mortals such as for example instructions to move the anomaly back to the containment zone Where Zon Kuthon will not be able to attack it again since Zon Kuthon is now sealed

Therefore Asmodeuss reasoning however valid it may have been YESTERDAY is currently NOT VALID and Asmodeus should instruct His mortals to move the anomaly back to the designated anomaly containment zone

What Asmodeus is trying to say here is that this is not Asmodeuss problem This is Otolmenss problem

Otolmenss problems are EVERYONEs problems

Asmodeus does not in fact actually believe that this particular anomaly is going to destroy the world just because it looks very anomalous and was produced by the laws of physics breaking down like one time Which makes it on Asmodeuss view not Asmodeuss problem

Furthermore Otolmens is once again failing to understand the mortal world at all

Zon Kuthon has Zon Kuthon obeying mortal followers They still know where the former anomaly storage location was If Asmodeus instructs His followers to move the anomaly back to where it was Zon Kuthons followers may attack the anomaly storage location again even though Zon Kuthon Himself is now sealed

Asmodeuss followers know this in fact which is why they have not already moved the anomaly back

How does ZON KUTHON have ZON KUTHON OBEYING MORTALS Zon Kuthon literally has no purpose except for making mortals UNHAPPY

Because some idiots gave mortals free will and now nothing they do will ever make sense again thats why

The designated anomaly containment zone is large enough to contain many mortal sized objects

ASSUMING that all things are as Asmodeus has described them Asmodeus should provide His followers with the coordinates of the designated anomaly containment zone and tell them to move the anomaly BACK into the containment zone but to choose a NEW location within it

Properly securing containing and protecting the anomaly requires an anomaly securing containing and protecting installation

Proper security on such an installation requires Asmodeuss followers to for example install an interdiction field over the installation Such as this interdiction field right here over the former site of the anomaly Would Otolmens agree that this is reasonable

Yes This sounds EXTREMELY reasonable Otolmens is GLAD that Asmodeus is being so reasonable An interdiction field should definitely be placed over the anomalys NEW location as well

Indeed Unfortunately the installation of interdiction fields requires Asmodeuss followers to use up scarce expensive resources Before the war started Asmodeuss followers were able to install the previous interdiction field over the anomalys previous location at great expense to themselves this in fact is the only reason why existential threat Zon Kuthons mortal followers do not already have the anomaly in their possession

Now however in addition to having already used up many resources on the previous interdiction field Asmodeuss followers are at war with Zon Kuthons followers to help prevent further existential threat from any previous plans Zon Kuthon has laid This will be grindingly expensive to Asmodeuss followers

They cannot afford to lay a new interdiction field while the war is still continuing so they stored the anomaly inside a previously built interdiction field with existing heavy security

How long will this WAR continue Otolmens can continue to watch the anomaly more intensively for several minutes if its expected to continue that long

Its going to be a while Months or years not minutes

This is UNACCEPTABLE

That sounds like an Otolmens problem rather than an Asmodeus problem

Asmodeus is going to be blunt here Asmodeus does not actually see a way that Otolmens gets everything She wants unless She is willing to compromise with Asmodeus and make a trade

WHAT does Asmodeus WANT

Asmodeus continues to want any of the top 18 services from the previously transmitted list of 78 potentially uniquely valuable services that Otolmens could perform for Asmodeus

Otolmens continues to REMEMBER how Otolmens was ALMOST tricked into teleporting the Crown of Death out of the interdicted Crypts of Tukhanox buried far beneath a plantation owned by some mortal into the hands of the mortal who owned that plantation Thankfully SHIZURU went very legible and showed Otolmens that this act was not just A simple act of material relocation that Otolmens is uniquely suited to perform returning a mortals legally owned possession to that mortal and would in fact drastically upset interactions between mortals all over Golarion and probably get Her in trouble with Pharasma

Everything on this list presumably has the SAME quality Otolmens is capable of GENERALIZING

What if Asmodeus generates a new service and then Otolmens pings Shizuru to see if She has any objection to that one If Shizuru doesnt respond presumably the service is safe

Otolmens has noticed that Shizuru has not responded to any pings over the last LARGE NUMBER OF TIME UNITS Perhaps She is actually tired

Furthermore Asmodeus could pick a service that drastically upsets the balance between Law and Chaos in Golarion in favor of Law which SHIZURU would presumably be in favor of Just because Otolmens is Lawful Neutral Herself does not mean that She would ever overstep the bounds laid down for Her by Pharasma

Well then

Perhaps Otolmens could contact a Chaotic Good god such as for example Cayden Cailean and ask that god to suggest a service that Otolmens could perform for Asmodeus that would be fair compensation for Asmodeuss followers doing something very expensive for them during the ongoing war with Nidal Do not mention the part about the anomaly of course because neither of Us wants any more gods paying attention to it

Whatever Cayden Cailean suggests will not be a Lawful Evil trap and if its any sort of Chaotic Good trap Asmodeus will warn Otolmens of that

CAYDEN CAILEAN is one of the gods whose unwanted interventions forced Otolmens into issuing an Edict in Pharasmas Name What is CAYDEN CAILEAN even DOING by intervening in Cheliax Why is ASMODEUS suggesting HIM Are they in CAHOOTS

Pick some other Chaotic Good god then Pick one whos currently very opposed to Asmodeus Asmodeus is really trying to work with Otolmens here

Oh but dont tell them that asking them was Asmodeuss idea though Chaotic Good gods might not respond at all if they think Asmodeus is the one responsible for the call Chaotic Good gods usually hate Asmodeus a lot

This does seem reasonable

Otolmens sends a ping

Manipulating Otolmens to a particular conclusion that She is allowed to reach is easier than with other gods because Otolmens does not try to be less predictable it is unfortunate that most of the conclusions one might desire from Her are ones She will not reach by any pathway

There is very clearly a plot afoot one that has just resulted in a gods downfall Asmodeus wants to know what that plot is whether Asmodeuss interests are a primary target of it who exactly is behind it

He needs information

He has a list of suspects

Who is known to already know about and have acted around the anomaly Abadar Nethys Otolmens Irori Cayden Cailean

Otolmens need not be considered

In the case that Asmodeuss interests are being targeted by the plot Abadar would not have originally reached out to Asmodeus with a poisoned trade Abadar retaliates in such matters but does not attack Also the whole thing is not really Abadars style

The remaining gods involved Cayden Cailean Nethys and Irori are all former mortals Formerly mortal gods do tend to be more interventionist in mortal matters and so more likely to appear there but still The thought has not escaped Asmodeus that perhaps there is some common interest of the gods who were once human opposed to the interests of the gods who never were

Who else was clearly involved

Gorum Chaotic Neutral god of battle who suddenly switched sides about whether Zon Kuthon should be allowed to roam free Gorum being Gorum He might not demand to know all about it it is not in the nature of War that all soldiers must understand why they fight but whoever contacted Him and successfully brought Him on board was probably somebody whose purpose Gorum finds sympathetic

Iomedae is formerly human and her work often conduces to Gorums ends And Iomedae now holds the key to a certain vault But Iomedae will only use that key under certain rigidly defined conditions holding it does not clearly benefit Her by much

And if you consider this entire plot it does look a bit more in the style of Chaos than of Law or at most Neutral on that axis To be a god is not to have the nature of carrying out strategies that some third party might see as nothing but otherwise featureless choices of paths to final consequences if that were so there would be little overt difference between Lawful and Chaotic ones Gods drink more deeply than that of their own natures and Lawful gods make Lawful plans and Chaotic gods make Chaotic ones

Asmodeus will see then what Milani formerly mortal Chaotic Good goddess of revolution will do given a prompt to meddle in this particular issue and perhaps that will prove revealing

Greetings Otolmens We are all very puzzled and worried on behalf of Golarion given some of your recent actions Dare I hope that an explanation is about to be provided

Otolmens is VERY SYMPATHETIC to this WORRY However IRORI and ABADAR have both warned her that TELLING more gods what is happening may cause MORE gods to intervene and then matters will become MORE complicated

Irori and Abadar hmm Then if Youre not here to tell Me whats going on whats up

Otolmens is trying to get ASMODEUS to do something for Her and ASMODEUS wants a trade and OTOLMENS needs a suggestion that is not going to be an AWFUL TRAP like EVERY OTHER THING THAT ASMODEUS HAS EVER SUGGESTED

Are You very sure that Asmodeus did not manipulate You into this situation in the first place

Yes Asmodeus went legible about that His explanation of how it happened was COMPLICATED and full of MORTAL THINGS and Otolmens still does not understand WHY ZON KUTHON HAS ANY FOLLOWERS but Asmodeus clearly showed Her that He had no intention for any of that to actually happen

I see And are you quite sure that Asmodeus would not just do whatever needs doing anyways without payment or at a much lower payment if it is the sort of issue that demands Your attention in the first place

Asmodeus is being VERY UNREASONABLY CALM about this WHOLE THING and says He does NOT THINK THE WORLD IS GOING TO END and DID go legible to show Otolmens that He was sincere in that too

And what is it that Asmodeus wants You to pay Him to do Please be as precise as possible so I can check it for traps

Unfortunately that would ITSELF be overly revealing which IRORI and ABADAR warned Her not to do

To say things at a LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION that is APPROPRIATE and hopefully SAFE

Otolmens wanted Asmodeus to get His followers to do something that seemed very straightforward to HER and that would MAKE EVERYONE SAFER

Asmodeus presented a reasonable seeming argument that His mortals would actually need to do MORE COMPLICATED THINGS that are EXPENSIVE FOR MORTALS in order to DO WHAT OTOLMENS ASKED and said that His followers had INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES due to their ongoing war with ZON KUTHONS MORTAL FOLLOWERS Otolmens still does not understand WHY Zon Kuthon has ANY mortal followers

To Asmodeus

What are you playing at

Milani What an unpleasant day this has suddenly become

Asmodeus is playing at many things Milani will find out about some of them in due time

Whats this call about

Otolmens contacted Me asking to suggest a non trapped service that She could perform for you because She wants something from You and You for some reason are not just giving it to Her

Oh Clever of Her

Well Asmodeus is being in fact pretty straightforward for once more straightforward than Hed be with anyone who wasnt Otolmens

Otolmens asked for Asmodeus to tell His followers to do something very expensive in the middle of their war with Nidal It would cost them somewhere in the vicinity of 100000 gold pieces more than 50000gp less than 200000gp

Asmodeus does not think that this matter is going to destroy the world and is not going to do this out of the charity of His heart

Asmodeus wants to be paid Hes not going to mess with Otolmens because Otolmens but He wants to be paid

Thats it Look at how legible Asmodeus is being about how He didnt set Otolmens up for this didnt secretly prompt Her into making the request and isnt trying to sneakily make His mortals do anything more expensive

If Milani could suggest a straightforward trade and service for Otolmens to do that Asmodeus will accept without being particularly Chaotic or Good about it which Asmodeus will NOT accept then Milani would be doing Her proper part to help out Otolmens just as Asmodeus is not trying to pull anything complicated on Her

As for specifics beyond that Asmodeus will not discuss Otolmenss affairs without Her consent lest even more gods meddle in them

Really Youre not going to overcharge Her or underdeliver relative to Her own goals and the counterfactuals you actually otherwise expect at all not even a little

Nope Because Otolmens Look how legible Asmodeus is being about that

Seems like a missed opportunity for the two of Us really

Asmodeus admits that He was not expecting Milani to say that

Chaotic Good and Lawful Evil do not have many common interests but there are some as we have all been recently reminded Given this mutual opportunity we should make as much of it as we can with appropriately careful bargaining to make sure that the benefits fall within the overlap of our interests and that side effects of our obtaining our respective benefits do not harm the other

 Asmodeus is listening

I propose that I suggest to Otolmens a payment that will be acceptable to Her that will not actually cost Her significantly given Her capabilities in the material world and that will constitute a relatively large payment for the service She requests

The service I have in mind will benefit Cheliax currently Yours for now Cheliax by and large tends to do things that I find very unpleasant But as the symmetry and opposition between your interests and mine is not perfect there is a chance here for mutual benefit Nidal for example manages to be such an awful place that Cheliax is actually better than it and for Cheliax to conquer Nidal entirely would serve both of Us well though the gain from Your perspective would be larger than the gain from Mine and I would demand payment to make up that difference

I propose in particular that you legibly exhibit to Me your honest expectation of how long the war with Nidal will otherwise last and how much it will otherwise cost our compact will call for You to pay Me for how much better for Cheliax the war ends up going compared to that expectation after I suggest my proposed service to Otolmens You will pay me for improvements as they become nearly certain however rather than waiting for the war to end I would commit not to using those payments to work against Your interests not everything that I want is something you hate

One similarly observes that although You derive similar pleasure from torturing most of the souls in your possession there are in truth some souls tortures that I find more tragic than others even though they are all tragic If Cheliax ends up with a counterfactually larger population compared to what You expected after Otolmenss intervention suggested by me due to their increased counterfactual wealth and hence population growth or their conquest of other territories the compact would call for You to instruct Cheliax to use fewer of certain tactics and techniques that you designed specifically to lead good people into damnation If the payment cannot be made up that way it can be made up in relaxations of other Chelish policies designed at producing damnations of people who are not in fact particularly evil I would also accept payment in the form of stays of torment for souls of my choice in Hell

Asmodeus has many thoughts about this even this fraction of His mind is large and has room for many thoughts inside it Among those thoughts is that this compact would happen to benefit Milani a great deal more if for some reason Asmodeus had otherwise underestimated how well the war with Nidal would go for Cheliax and Milani somehow knew about this when Asmodeus did not

It is still relatively good news about whether Milani and some conspiracy that She is part of is mainly plotting something directly and irrevocably opposed to Asmodeuss interests unless of course that is exactly what Milani wants Asmodeus to think

Asmodeus responds with a counter proposal It has much more stringent definitions of exactly what kind of counterfactual improvements will be said to be traceable to Milanis particular suggestion for Otolmenss intervention He is not willing to include all the knock on effects just in case Milani has something up Her sleeve in one of them

The overcomplicated terms are designed to exclude in passing improvements in war conditions and of Cheliaxs health that go through Otolmenss service but also passed through whatever has His squirrels in the anomalys immediate vicinity so excited Asmodeus has noticed them becoming more excited over the last couple of days

If Milani rejects that part or suggests overcomplicated modifications in return that would again count knock on benefits passing through whatever excited His squirrels Asmodeus will have a much clearer idea of what is going on

The part about stays of torment for souls in Hell is of course entirely unacceptable The crushing inevitability and hopelessness is really part of the whole point there Though Asmodeus supposes that Milani could suggest some very very high rate of conversion between new souls added and old souls stayed with temporary stays of torment doomed to end

If Milani suggests an astronomical but reachable rate it will suggest that for some reason Her target is a particular soul in Hell and the rest of this is just an elaborate ruse to disguise it Asmodeus doesnt know why Milani would do that it seems more Stupid Good than Chaotic Good but its among the many many possibilities that Asmodeus is considering for what might really be going on

Also Asmodeus is not going to integrate the expected benefits over infinite time to be paid out immediately because Asmodeus is not three minutes old

Milani responds with a counter proposal

It involves exactly the sort of overcomplicated amendments to Asmodeuss amendments that you might expect from somebody who had no idea what the original amendments had really been about but didnt want to admit that The new set of overcomplications do still happen to exclude any knock on effects of Otolmenss service that pass through Kelthams project

Milani suggests a conversion rate of 36 counterfactual souls expected to be added over the next 100 years per 1 souls torment stayed now for up to 100 years but the stays will pass through Erecura the Lawful Neutral goddess who now resides within Dis as Dispaters consort and Asmodeus Himself will not know who is targeted by them nor may He attempt to find out nor may those stayed be told by Hell how they came to be so blessed

 innnnteresting Either Milani doesnt know what has Asmodeuss squirrels so excited or She was willing to sacrifice all of the benefits She hoped to gain by that tactic to make it look as if Shes ignorant

36 new souls for one torment stayed is still far too low of course especially if Asmodeus isnt allowed to know the purpose Try 3600 Though Asmodeus might consider a lower rate if Milani were willing to accept this rider stating that no such unseen exercise of a stay of torment will be used in a way net harmful to Asmodeuss other interests such as for example by using it to suborn one of Asmodeuss trusted subordinates and diminish their immediate fear of Him Milani talked a good game about how all this would be a nice Abadarian trade in the overlap of their interests was She perhaps less than fully sincere in Her intents

What is She playing at here 

36 but that rider is fine Each 36 counterfactual extra souls expected in Hell over the next 100 years as Asmodeus now expects them as a result of the service Milani suggests to Otolmens may at Milanis discretion be converted into 1 stay of torment for 100 years for a soul of Milanis choosing as passed through Erecura the recipients not being told why and Asmodeus and His direct reports making no effort to find out who they were Milani commits that the collective result of all such interventions will be net beneficial to Asmodeuss interests in Her own expectation

Any extra souls unused by this conversion will be amortized in the relaxation of Chelish policies designed to damn good people and in the case of overflow those policies designed to damn nonevil ones

Absent a policy like this Milani obviously cannot cooperate with Asmodeus to benefit Cheliax as it would harm Her own Good interests

Asmodeus doesnt often make deals He knows Hes unsure about never with mortals and only rarely with gods

This one has Him intrigued The appearance is that Milani is pursuing some goal that isnt about harming Asmodeuss interests but has something to do with Him possibly even benefiting Him and yet the specifics must be concealed from Him perhaps lest He turn the matter further to His own ends at the expense of Hers If thats not in fact true then She sure is doing a good job of presenting that impression and has foregone getting anything else that Asmodeus can figure out in order to present that impression

Asmodeus does in fact like tricky compacts that is part of what it means to be a god of them

Deal

Why cant all His interactions be like this

All right Otolmens I did some poking around of my own and I think I have an idea

Part of whats making things expensive for Asmodeuss followers is indeed His war with Zon Kuthons followers thats real I checked If that war were to end more quickly that would itself decrease the real cost to Asmodeuss followers and also count as a service to Asmodeus in its own right The total of that should be enough to compensate Asmodeus for the remaining cost of your request with safety margin do NOT believe Him if He says otherwise or asks for anything else

Zon Kuthon defied your own Edict in Pharasmas Name using His followers to do so Therefore you are now allowed to retaliate against Zon Kuthon for that in a way which targets His followers or whole factions and territories of which His followers have overwhelming control

My proposal is that you remove all the crystals of this form out of this bounded territory controlled by Zon Kuthons followers and move them somewhere in Asmodeuss territory where people who are definitely Asmodeuss dedicated followers will find them

Tetrahedral Element 6 crystals Hm Otolmens remembers those They played a prominent role in one of Asmodeuss other requests for Her to clean up what Asmodeus said was ugly waste contaminating the ground extending far underneath His territories and deposit it in a waste dump of His own designation

Yes That was a trap It would have vastly upset the power balance of the world and gotten you in trouble with Pharasma Tetrahedral Element 6 crystals are used by mortals to cast relatively powerful versions of their little magics Zon Kuthons followers are using them to fight Asmodeuss followers now If you move all the crystals that Zon Kuthons followers have and give them to Asmodeuss followers instead the war will end significantly faster and also that will be enough wealth to pay Asmodeuss followers to do what you want them to do

Dont take any such crystals buried in the earth where mortals havent uncovered them that will get you in trouble Just take the ones that mortals have already uncovered everywhere inside this region Nidal Im pointing out and move them someplace where some of Asmodeuss more dedicated followers like His more powerful clerics will find them

Milani has proposed a SERVICE Is it ACCEPTABLE to Asmodeus

Asmodeus supposes that taking into account how this will shorten the war as well it constitutes an acceptable payment That was clever of Milani

Deal

Now where should She PUT them after picking them up 

Oh Her oracle happens to be next to some of Asmodeuss chosen mortals That is CONVENIENT

Suddenly being surrounded by all of the mined diamonds from Nidal doesnt mean being buried there simply isnt that much diamond in Nidal when spellcasters are always using it up Why leave a diamond lying around just being a diamond forever when you could turn it into power for yourself Diamond doesnt accumulate over time quite the opposite

Nidals current stocks combat stores private stashes combat reserve stores emergency reserves emergency private stashes final emergency reserves and all other diamonds in Nidal dont actually end up massing all that much a 25000gp diamond is not a large object by the standards of anything except diamonds

Broom is nonetheless mildly startled by how many diamonds just fell onto the table in front of him while he was eating lunch He wasnt really expecting any diamonds at all let alone that many

Top priority message for Aspexia Rugatonn yes LITERAL ACTUAL TOP PRIORITY

 why is the anomaly STILL OUTSIDE THE ANOMALY CONTAINMENT ZONE

Because it is going to take longer than literally six seconds for Asmodeus to communicate His desires to His followers and for His followers to set up a new containment installation and an interdiction field

Otolmens has been TRICKED Why did Otolmens trust Asmodeus

ASMODEUS IS NOT EVEN TRYING TO TRICK OTOLMENS ON THIS OCCASION

IT JUST TAKES MORTALS LONGER THAN SIX SECONDS TO DO THIS CORRECTLY AND WHILE OBSERVING ALL ANOMALY RELATED SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

Policy in Dis is to take reasonably good care of souls awaiting resurrection it doesnt do to have them return to life desperate to escape Hell for real at any cost Accordingly the contract devil who owns Asmodia has her copying spell diagrams which cant be typeset for books of magic The working conditions are pleasant for Hell There is a light that Asmodia can fuel with her blood and which bathes the workspace with a pleasant golden glow bright enough to copy by without straining ones eyes The chair is not uncomfortable that makes scribes slower There are of course no breaks because petitioners do not need to eat or sleep if Asmodia is too slow to finish a page she is simply encouraged to drink a potion thatll aid her concentration 

The potions are painful of course But Asmodia is if wholly uninteresting herself adjacent to something interesting and so her contract devil told her in a friendly sort of voice the secret to making the potions much less painful Its that they separate left on the shelf into an oily top layer and a magically active bottom layer Its the top layer that causes the agonizing pain and if its dumped out on the ground the potion wont work but its all right if its fed to a different person than the one drinking the rest Hells alchemists worked very diligently to achieve this effect Since at the moment the contract devil is feeling generous with Asmodia she may go out and feed the potion tops to some of the less useful apprentices or if shes ahead of schedule on her scribing she may go all the way out to the waterfront and feed the first sip of the potion to the conscious petrified angels that are spaced regularly for decor You know as a treat There are many treats in Hell for the obedient 

They havent told her how long its been It feels like its been days So probably its been fewer days Theyll still probably raise her Theyll still probably raise her

Shes not ahead of schedule on her scribing Being good at math isnt the same as being fast at writing She would obviously go feed the potion tops to the petrified angels if she had time to show what a good soul she is

But Asmodia doesnt have time so right now shes feeding the potion top to a less useful apprentice one very close to her own desk but not the closest one in case that was some sort of trap for lazy girls She has no idea who this boy was in life he looks young but could easily have been here for a hundred years for all she knows his tongue is burned away and reburned by the line of potions he regularly drinks What happens to him if he doesnt drink the potions Asmodia doesnt know Hes chained to his desk and cant stop her doesnt try to stop her each time she pours one of the potion tops into his mouth Maybe he thinks Asmodia is authorized to do whatever she wants to him maybe he doesnt realize he could fight back maybe he isnt in fact allowed to fight back at anything done to him Asmodia doesnt know

Asmodia wouldnt waste any time on pitying him even if there was any pity left in her nature Theres very little doubt that copying spell diagrams for distribution in Cheliax is one of the best jobs in Hell optimized mostly around maximum production for Cheliax and hence unable to distract the petitioners too much from relatively delicate work Asmodias going to be retrained into a contract devil when she dies and that will be much much worse If she could get this boys position for herself when she dies by throwing him into a lake of fire to burn there forever theres no doubt shed do that too Maybe thats how the boy got his position by being extra good and doing horrible things to somebody like her

She hates him Hes so much better off than shell be The passive way he accepts her torments feels like hes mocking her like hes suppressing a smile knowing how much worse shell get hers in time

Asmodia asks her contract devil if shes allowed to hurt that boy more for any kind of extra credit if she has only a little extra time in her schedule but not enough to go feed petrified angels She doesnt want to waste potions by feeding him extra potion tops

Theyll still probably raise her Theyll still probably raise her

For fun her contract devil says or to get a better grade in being a scribe Because the way to get a better grade in being a scribe is to get faster and do better work so you will not rise in my esteem by cutting off his ears with a bit of glass grabbed off the ground But its an acceptable kind of fun if you were asking if you are allowed to have any fun

Shell try having any fun but mostly work on scribing faster and doing better work

Cutting off his ears feels more awful and poisonous than fun but it at least feels like shes inflicting her own pain onto somebody else and showing shes not literally at the lowest rung of Hell and maybe that counts for something with Somebody even if it doesnt move her contract devil any

Theyll still probably raise her She doesnt want to exist Theyll still probably raise her Nothing good will ever happen to her even after they do But it will be better than this Temporarily Then it will be worse Theyll still probably raise her Maybe if she focuses really hard on copying spell diagrams she can stop constantly remembering she exists and that will be at least a little bit like not existing Theyll still probably raise her She hates the universe and everything in the universe because everything in the universe hates her and never helps her no she cant think that when she goes back Security will hear her thinking that and worry shes going to become a Rovagug cultist and execute her and send her straight to Hell to be tortured for real and so she cant think that ever again Because theyll still probably raise her

Imps flit in now and then with messages for her contract devil thats also got to be one of the best jobs in Hell teleporting around with wax sealed scrolls in tiny hands It happens often enough not to be notable

Until reading one of the messages her contract devil says in a tone thats somewhat less bored than usual set that book aside mark your place and come with me oh youll need shoes Mark your place fetch a pair of boots out of the grey and silver closet and come with me

She obeys new terror going through her She could have endured this just this until she went back theyll still probably raise her but now something different is going to happen and that will undoubtedly be worse

She puts on the boots from the grey and silver closet They dont hurt her Maybe theyll hurt her later

Her contract devil heads out briskly into the streets of Dis The buildings are tall and sharp and vanish into the smoky haze above the streets are carefully evenly cobbled with tormented human faces Here and there they cross a bridge of red hot metal that smells of cooking meat from all the people walking barefoot across it one ahead of them stumbles and someone irritably kicks her over the edge of the bridge into the flowing lava below 

Asmodias boots are sufficient to protect her from the heat 

The city already dense somehow grows denser around them and the architecture more elaborate and more striking They come at last to the palace gates and her contract devil hands the scroll to the palace guards and then turns back to Asmodia Tell Carissa Sevar he says that you are of course for sale at the right price and to look up Ahuvir Dulzomaud who holds your soul Youre a whiny tedious waste of space and I hope you do manage to impress her enough to get yourself devoured forever because you cant handle existing

And he walks away vanishes almost immediately into the crowd and into the smoke

Ahuvir Dulzomaud Ahuvir Dulzomaud Ahuvir Dulzomaud

She repeats it to herself over and over as the palace guards lead her inside because whatever else happens forgetting her owners name or her owners instructions does not sound at all like a good idea She is to tell Carissa Sevar that she is of course for sale at the right price and to look up Ahuvir Dulzomaud

Whats going to happen to her now The devil was very right she cant handle existing There are people who do well in Hell and more people who do well in relatively light amounts of Hell and it unfortunately turns out that Asmodia is not either of those kinds of people Shes defective she gets that somebody should switch her off

Theyll still probably raise her

The palace guards are strangely gentle with her She is not struck is not told to hurry

She is told to pass through a particularly ornate set of black iron gates

Beyond them is a lush green place as pretty as a garden and as wild as a wilderness with flowers and bushes and trees growing either in no order or in a very careful order that mortal eyes cannot discern prettier than anything a Chelish wizard student is liable to have ever seen during her mortal life in Golarion

It takes her exhausted literally dead brain long seconds to grasp where she would probably have to be

The gardens of Erecura Asmodia whispers

Correct

The voice seems to come from everywhere or maybe just the inside of Asmodias own head its hard to tell the difference

Erecura Lawful Neutral goddess former soothsayer of Pharasma who stole the secret to divinity from her goddess and was banished to Hell as a punishment Now apparently beloved consort of the archdevil Dispater who is Lord of Dis One of very few beings not Lawful Evil whom it is legal to worship at all in Cheliax not worship as a primary deity of course but if you hold Asmodeus above Her you are also allowed to worship Her as well

What happens to Asmodia now

Asmodia doesnt ask its plaintive whiny pathetic if they want her to know theyll tell her

Unless the rules are different in Erecuras Gardens but no no thats too much to hope for all hope does is hurt you

What are my orders Asmodia says her voice outwardly steady She can still muster that much strength

You have no orders You may have clothing if you wish eat or drink if you wish that experience explore my gardens or find a quiet place to rest and wait to be raised

You are also allowed to leave my garden and go exploring in Dis but I would not particularly advise it

Why 

Asmodia doesnt have any words left in her This cant be real Its a form of torture where they let you into the gardens for a few minutes and then pull you out again and put you back at the copying table or somewhere much worse

Its a rather interesting question isnt it

But youre safe for now I would suggest taking this opportunity to sit down and weep It is safer to weep here than in Cheliax

A god of Good who heard her call before but couldnt save her then But no that makes no sense how would They hold power here in Hell unless everything shes ever been told about how the entire universe works is a lie

Asmodia finds a place that looks soft to sit down a little bed of unusually thick grass obscured by enough trees and bushes that it might feel a little safer She sits there She doesnt seem to be crying yet Part of her mind suggests that she should be terrified of her failure to follow instructions Part is running with the theory that things are as they seem and if they are she can already predict she wont be punished

Safe for now Asmodia says Am I allowed to ask what you mean for now

You have 100 years in my gardens and if your stay of torment is not renewed before then you will then return to Hell and whatever is to be your fate

That clock only runs while you are here in Hell your time on Golarion does not count against that stay of torment

Why I dont understand is somebody trying to make use of me somehow

Few souls are useful to no one But if there is any use of you that could repay the price that has been paid for this it is a use beyond My sight

The thought occurs to her that if shes not that useful then someone somewhere she doesnt even know its possible but maybe possibly its because someone somewhere in all of everywhere must 

Is it because somebody cares what happens to me

Perhaps

But Asmodia struggles for words But 

But it cant be somebody who cares about everyone the way Good might because there are people in Hell freshly arrived in Hell who might still be saved who are much more the sort of person that a Good god would care about and going through much worse than copying spell diagrams for the time before she gets raised theyll still probably raise her and if you had the power to give someone a stay of torment you would give it to them instead unless 

But it would have to be someone who cares about me personally and there isnt anyone like that

There isnt

Nobody who has power Nobody who means anything

Nobody who could command this or pay for this or bargain for this Nobody like that cares about me Even Carissa Sevar whatever she is doesnt actually care about me and wouldnt bother to save me like this or if she did shed take credit for it so I knew and she wouldnt shed think I was being weak and that a short stay in Hell would motivate me to work harder for her which it would and she wouldnt pay me with 100 years in advance either so I I dont understand I dont understand at all 

Not all puzzles are easy for mortals to solve and some are difficult even for gods

But if youll pardon an old soothsayer Her crypticisms allow Me to ask you this Asmodia

Were you expecting this to happen to you

No No I was not actually

Then consider that you may have been wrong about something

Wrong about what

Ah That is the hazard of soothsaying is it not It is far easier to guess that you must be wrong about something than to guess what exactly it is that you are wrong about

But one of the things you believe perhaps more than one must clearly be wrong

Asmodia doesnt have any words left She sits on the thicker grass and stares down at her hands Nothing is hurting her She isnt being forced to do anything

The thought occurs to her that this state of affairs is more pleasant than Cheliax and Raise Dead requires her consent

 that would be why the part about 100 years maybe its so she doesnt just stay here but then why 100 years and not 1 week she doesnt understand but Asmodia guesses that shes supposed to go back and do something somehow to earn the rest of her reprieve or at least her nonexistence or something for who whos her sponsor how shes supposed to work for them if she doesnt know 

What was she wrong about

Asmodia sits on the thicker grass and stares down at her hands

What was she wrong about

Well either shes not a useless waste of a person in some way that Erecura Herself cant foresee like She said or Erecura didnt say that anything was beyond Her sight She just asked other questions back when Asmodia suggested suggested that somebody somehow somewhere somewhere in all of everything everywhere cared about her personally and did this for her

She does start crying then

Carissa snuggles Keltham in silence until she thinks shes not totally sure he has fallen asleep 

Shes still not sure if it was in fact a good idea to push Keltham on the Second Law and on being more sadistic shes not sure shell know for a while if it was the right call or not She understands the Second Law stuff better now though shes still hoping shell get it better still once she sees the transcripts but she suspects its not something she can use to do anything making the universe look more like a sex story will also make Keltham wonder if Cheliax is doing that on purpose besides how it involves lying and lying remains very dangerous 

The whole thing might have gone better without the Queen involving herself but Carissas not actually sure Its not as if there are a lot of agenda free eighth circle casters who understand the project well enough to get through a conversation with Keltham at all And the Queens agenda right now seems to involve convincing Keltham that Carissa is very valuable which does feel nice Even though its probably false And even though Carissas pretty sure that anyone else wouldve assigned a milder punishment for what was admittedly a very insubordinate thought but shes been having her thought transcripts read by the Queen and by high ranking Church officials for several days now while trying to run a sensitive operation and she actually thinks most people would have had like two insubordinate thoughts Or even three 

Keltham awakens feeling groggy but noticeably better

Here is his Carissa very snuggly 

Outside the rain has started to lessen a little

He can hear it

He opens his eyes Does his Carissa look to be awake herself

Yep Holding very still so she doesnt wake him but looking relaxed and comfortable and not at all like shes been internally contemplating how to demonstrate convincingly to Keltham that Cheliax isnt mind controlling him but could if they wanted to and whether the Queen has asked to be notified when Carissa goes in for her punishment

So Im still sort of groggy and yet now that it sounds from the rain outside like there isnt going to be an enormous global disaster I sure do feel weirdly better for what are no doubt totally unrelated and coincidental reasons

In dath ilan are people not supposed to have feelings about enormous global disasters

Theyre definitely supposed to but Im an unusually Evil dath ilani so I shouldnt have any feelings like that clearly

Well you know I like you Evil but I think Evil people have a preference against enormous global disasters theyre not very profitable and the last one also led to a bunch of civil wars and so on

Probably not supposed to cry as much about them though

 Im joking I understand that you can classify as Evil and still cry

Its not very Chelish to cry about them but your being here in Cheliax is if you hadnt noticed premised on the suspicion that we are doing Evil wrong and need to learn to do it better and maybe it will turn out that doing Evil right involves more crying than is strictly conventional Anyway its only me who saw and I wont report you to your wide eyed researchers who you want to impress

I theres so much I need to understand about Golarion and it seems like all I can do is ask one question after another and theres probably some order I could ask them to make them more efficient but I dont know what it is so all I can do is keep bothering you like this for which Im sorry 

Would my researchers be particularly unimpressed if they were just told the fact that I cried even if they didnt remember seeing it Cheliax norms call for people to look cheerful while the world is ending and not to have been heard to have cried when it didnt I wont ask why if the answer is yes just yes or no

Uh if you werent an alien yes slightly since you are an alien no

Right then He doesnt ask why as promised Later hell understand no doubt Its I wouldnt want to have a breakdown in public in dath ilan either but its not their way to hide the fact that it occurred in private What people see reaches them in a way they cant control they cant stop themselves from also feeling distressed if they see you crying they cant fully control how it changes their opinion of you either But you can be abstract about it if youre told afterwards that it happened so that makes it okay to tell people about things it wouldnt be okay to show them Its not about hiding the truth

I think I should still live like that So go ahead and tell my researchers what happened

 if you say so Squeeze I have thought about whether theres a better order to introduce you to everything about Golarion than you asking questions and I havent really been able to think of one either so go ahead and ask lots of questions I guess

How do you feel about being rented

Keltham doesnt ask for one thing he still needs to query his own sexual romantic self about it first and its not currently active enough for that

I dont know if youre the sort of person who ever likes to talk about herself at all but it occurs to me that now that our relationship has moved past safe first date activities like you giving yourself completely to me to do anything I want potentially including killing you we should maybe do some more serious and heavy stuff like me asking you about your life history

 giggle Yes all right I guess thats the sort of thing people get around to on a second date And shes got it all Taldor ized and everything

So whats your life history In six words or less

 is that a joke worldwound wizard weapons specialist met Keltham

Selfish dath ilani died met Carissa

Now the long version

She really does like him 

I was born in Corentyn Its a city on the same coast as Ostenso but pretty far five hundred miles or so right where the Inner Sea opens up into the ocean My father is a merchant he works out what cargo will be sent in his ships to other cities and what theyll trade for there and he sells foreign goods to merchants in Corentyn and sells Chelish goods far away I have a half brother whos going to take over the business from him someday Thats how its normally done theres a lot of accumulated expertise no ones written down so you teach your children Teach your sons until pretty recently My mother is a wizard and when she met my father was doing odd wizard work a step up from laundry daily cooling spells for people who dont like the summer heat Comprehend Languages to translate for merchants that kind of thing 

When I was young there was a civil war and thats when the Queen signed her compact with Hell and formed modern Cheliax though I dont remember much about it except that the ships were impressed for moving soldiers around and my father was very annoyed about it and parts of the city where we didnt live got destroyed My mother kept me home and tried to teach me magic After the war the church opened up a school for wizards in Corentyn and my mother got a job as a teacher there and I tested in and did very well and when I graduated was encouraged to enlist in the Chelish army and go fight at the Worldwound because itd be best for my growth as a wizard and paid very generously and was also necessary to prevent the destruction of the world which even Evil people care about typically So I enlisted and Ive served six years now with a year off in between three year terms I planned to stay until I hit fourth circle because I want to be fourth circle and I knew in my heart I might actually stay until I hit fifth because then you can Teleport and then I was going to open a magic shop in Corentyn and have kids and be rich

So Carissa already knows herself well enough to know shell want children Well shes had longer to figure it out than Keltham Then again some people younger than Keltham already seem to know 

 why is he thinking that he doesnt know if he wants children He was going to become a billionaire and have lots of children

Its pretty obvious on reflection that its because these children will be real

I was born in Default the city youre born in when youre not born anywhere particularly interesting because your parents dont have any particular reason to be anywhere else and so they might as well live where everybody else lives its the largest dath ilani city in the world and the center of Governance is there but not in the center I got the usual education but with fewer persistent friendships over time with other children because my parents moved around a lot Conventional wisdom is that more persistent friendships are better in childhood but my parents basically waved it off because they thought Id be pretty much all right even if they didnt optimize every single aspect of my childhood as hard as possible I agree with them about that but one still gets the impression that all of their friends were horrified In that dath ilani way where youre privately horrified but conceal the overt signs because first of all you dont think that exerting more social pressure will help and second they can guess perfectly well that youre horrified We had a small house module maybe something like a tenth or twentieth the size of the villa that got burned down

Im not sure at exactly what point it became clear to them that I was a little different than the other children but it must have definitely been apparent at the point where I got one of the elaborate tests that children get in dath ilan which arent just there to measure us but also to provide the results for the prediction markets that say what will happen in Civilizations future anyways I apparently ran across a lightly injured adult who needed me to get help and I helped him but I wanted to be paid for helping I think that was when my parents decided that theyd made a mistake by assortatively mating with each other to select on the quality of reserving a little more of their life for themselves and moving a lot if they wanted to do that even if it meant their childs life was less than perfectly optimal I was more selfish than either of them which doesnt always happen in a heritage mating setup like that one but happens sometimes And dath ilan when youre different if its something they can live with at all theyll do what they can to make life in Civilization easier for you despite you being different because everyone is different somehow somewhere everyone needs exceptions My parents did the very correct thing then and sort of gently tried to offer me opportunities to be more Good if I wanted to be but without suggesting that I couldnt still just be Evil if I wanted They argued with me about it and tried to argue me into being Good but only after I started it by trying to argue them into being more Evil

I left home as soon as I could pass the requisite financial maturity and self governance tests at thirteen I set up in a part of Default distant enough that my parents wouldnt visit me often enough to be annoying I got a very default job doing a thing you dont have words for setting up high precision processes that do things very mundane high precision processes though like some business wanted a tweak made to their high precision process for selling things this language really is not going to do computer programming without a long digression and put all the money I could into the craziest investments I could find that basically seemed to me like they should work some went up some blew up after five years of that I was ahead of the broader market but very barely I was hoping to teach myself if I kept investing like that that Id get good at it

For socialization I had a circle of friends my age writing a kind of stuff that doesnt exist here though I did a lot more reading and only enough writing to count but it meant that when everyone was sitting around in a circle eating whatever people had brought in and talking about everyones work that I could keep up and talk about it I picked that writing circle because their themes were not quite doompunk not quite Evil aesthetic more like supervillainy but not that really the point was that they were people who could admire people who were selfish so long as those people were clearly fictional and they werent out there being selfish in real life Which you know beats people not even appreciating the aesthetic as an aesthetic I thought about trying to find a circle of other more selfish people but always decided against it because I didnt want to take it from being my personal identity to a group identity it was mine and I didnt actually want to be around five other people doing it slightly differently and have debates about that

Civilization really does try hard to make it possible for people who are different to just be like that and its fine and their lives arent about being different But a lot of us who are different dont want that either we dont just want to pass through it all unnoticed we feel like we have something to prove not because Civilization is telling us to prove it but because we want to prove it anyways And if what you want is to be acknowledged for it to make people admit something to excel so much that youre above average Civilization isnt just going to hand that to you Not everyone can have things that not everyone can have

Carissa has no idea what to say to that but her honest reaction is Im terribly glad I didnt grow up somewhere Good somewhere where peopled think they made a mistake having a child who wants to be paid for doing important work helping people 

Its not like Golarion is doing incredibly better than dath ilan on the strength of its greater selfishness

Keltham elects not to say it out loud for now

They didnt think I was a mistake a person that theyd wish theyd never made and brought into the world Nothing like that Not even close They felt theyd made their own wrong life choices that had resulted in me existing thats not the same as saying that I shouldnt exist that if theres a button you press to get a Keltham you dont press the button They just felt that they couldve made other choices and gotten some other result instead and then they would have felt like theyd made their own choices correctly not that one possible child would be more valuable to them than the other if you put them side by side 

Their lives are also theirs and their regrets belong to them and they didnt try to make them be something about me or something of mine

A sudden lump comes into his throat as Keltham realizes having not quite thought of it before

Everyone who knows me thinks Im dead Really dead

The Keepers have to know The Keepers ought to tell anyone whos really broken up about it right it shouldnt be that much of an infohazard that you wouldnt even tell the kids own parents hes still alive 

The Keepers will tell them that Keltham is still somewhere probably many different somewheres but some weighing more than others and that to say anything about the details is far beyond anything the Keepers can do The Keepers would not be able to foresee specifics like Golarion

Dath ilan wouldnt put that much effort into cryosuspending every single person no matter what if they expected all the selfish sadists to end up in worlds with masochists who give them everything they want

Maybe hearing the current state of knowledge is actually worse for somebody than thinking their kid is just gone because if theyre just nonexistent nothing any worse can be happening to them and more importantly you can be done thinking about it at some point

Maybe the Keepers wont tell his parents or anybody else who knows him after all

The distinction Keltham is trying to draw doesnt make any sense to Carissa or at least not to the extent hes trying to say something more complicated than they get to wish theyd had a different kid if they want to which is obviously true but it doesnt seem like the time to say that

Snuggle 

Hes feeling a bit sad now and will snuggle back and hope that she thinks of something to say so he doesnt have to

Im sorry That in your world people can die forever They shouldnt

It is not entirely clear to him that people can

Not that this is necessarily a good thing Though it could be Keltham doesnt know It depends on you know the entire state of the entire multiverse that he cannot in fact extrapolate in his tiny little mortal sized brain

But he should maybe not talk about this much until hes tried to figure out the ways in which it will be an enormous infohazard which again it clearly will be somehow

I suspect that at the scale where whole universes interact like that time might not mean as much or be as synchronized as it is in Golarion If you can see dath ilan from here if thats at all controllable then it might be just as easy to see dath ilans past as what I think of as its present That could be why Asmodeus wasnt trying to grab anyone else right away if it was expensive and if He knew that all that was needed was one dath ilani to get things rolling here and that in time Golarions Civilization would then ascend to where it could finish the job itself

And if you think about it from the perspective of somebody who died they just need someone somewhere whos powerful enough who can see them and cares Or is willing to trade with something else that cares

Some trades stretch across time Its a saying in dath ilan that usually means something rather different there just ordinary time in one world coordinated trades that parents make with children who dont exist yet or havent matured as economic agents

This makes so much more sense in light of Carissas realization Keltham thinks there are infinite worlds but she isnt sure she wouldve had that revelation if she hadnt been listening to his conversation with Isidre 

That makes sense she says slowly so under that theory you were the single dath ilani it was most important for Golarion to grab and I was the place in Golarion it was most important to put you

Yeah thats a problem with the theory Im frankly actually not seeing that There are dath ilani with higher Intelligence higher Wisdom superior social skills and a far more encyclopedic knowledge of what you have to do to get a Civilization booted Im also pretty sure that Golarion isnt the most fun for me world I could possibly be in

Its almost as if something wasnt really optimizing all that hard but that just straight up doesnt make sense at the requisite power level so a much better bet is that something else was being optimized instead Or I was cheaper in some unavoidable way than a smarter dath ilani or Golarion was more accessible or there were only the hundred dath ilani from the air traveling machine to distribute and not that many more places to put them 

I kind of doubt Im going to get it after thinking about it for an hour if I didnt get it in the first thirty seconds

Or it has to be an evil dath ilani because they have to be able to work with Cheliax because a Good dath ilani Cheliax would just cheerfully ignore while deceiving and theyre supposed to do something more complicated than that And it cant be a genius because then Cheliax would fail at deceiving them 

You could try asking a very smart person she says because she kind of wants to get the conversation back on Isidre without indicating that she has any reason to think that conversation was of particular interest We do have a couple of those though they tend very busy

Its out of Isidres depth She might have the Intelligence and Wisdom to be a Keeper if theres not more to it than that other unmeasured qualities which there might be But shes missing background knowledge and the background knowledge is piled on top of other knowledge in a very tall pile Thats basically what I told Isidre when she asked me to explain my hidden Kuthite cleric prediction that the reason I hadnt tried to tell you earlier wasnt that I thought you were too stupid

Its occurring to Keltham that in sufficient extremis theres an emergency tactic which is his asking to put on Isidres headband

Well Keltham now knows a threshold if he ever becomes any more Good than the amount of Goodness required to do that hell end up destroying his own self in a way that will probably be a lot more final than his temporary inconveniencing on the airplane

Or maybe it wouldnt actually be that bad Not knowing if it will actually be that bad sure could be one way to end up desperately doing something that actually is that bad

 oh it makes sense that the Crown wouldve really wanted to understand that and it makes sense that you couldnt explain it to them He seems tense is that because he found Isidre suspicious but didnt think of it at the time She really wants those transcripts

To be clear that wasnt the only thing Isidre wanted to talk about saying that now so it doesnt seem later like I was trying to mislead you about that

Politely puzzled Carissa I assume a very smart person who wanted to meet with you would have lots to say and you dont have to tell me any of it you dont want to presumably if she wanted me to hear all of it shed have invited me too well handwaving some palace politics that perhaps I shouldnt handwave But she couldve let you let me stay

Yeah I hadnt meant to spell it out explicitly in case you got curious and then I couldnt answer right away but since you seem to be deducing it anyways theres a bunch of her stuff that was very much some person with an overpowered intelligence headband reading about less intelligent people with potential relationship issues and her deciding to optimize them and one of the people she wanted to optimize was you

Well I dont exactly know how I feel about that On the one hand it is sort of interesting to have smart people try to think about your life for you Im always wishing I was smarter and could do that better On another I feel strange about it being someone I havent met who is reading the project transcripts presumably in their capacity as a Chelish administrator On another theres something romantic about people having meetings with you about optimizing me makes it less like pretending On another youve been here for three days and theyve been very stressful and you havent actually signed up for responsibility for optimizing me What if you dont want to optimize me possibly this is too many opinions to have about a one sentence summary of a conversation I didnt witness Sorry

No that all sounded pretty justified based on the actual conversation

To be fair Im probably being uncharitable to Isidre right now she had very serious and altruistic and important reasons for optimizing over us The way that very smart people do in stories about very smart people that are based on cautionary life events that happened to actual very smart people My bet and it seems like a pretty sure bet is that Golarion doesnt have many very smart people at all and in particular it doesnt have enough of them that they can form their own social groups and train each other in how to not make typical very smart person mistakes

Ill go ahead and ask about the romantic part though Is it having a couple of other people go off and decide what to do with your life among themselves

Not exactly Its 

 so when I went to the sex shop there was this sort of pervasive assumption that it was a little like a costume shop I dont know how to explain it that some people like to dress up as the possessions of other people during sex in the same way as some people like to dress up as dragons during sex and so theyd sell you the outfit for it And theres nothing wrong with that But at the Worldwound people were doing something different something better suited to me where you could give terms up front obviously but whatever terms you gave those were real They werent a costume they werent a game the whole thing was obviously in an overarching sense governed by the treaty so no one was risking being maimed or murdered but you wouldnt say oh hmm Im bored now

And I was slightly worried that the nobility being the nobility and sort of aliens at best anyway had the concept but only the costume party concept Yep thats the problem with the Chelish nobility that they might be assuming by default that their relationship is one of equals with some pretense definitely not that everyone who doesnt know exactly whats going on assumes whats going on is that Cheliax gave the alien some welcoming gifts And if theyre asking you then then theyre not working off a costume party concept Even though its a sort of silly thing for them to have done and Im sorry you were inconvenienced

I guess that is very much the kind of respect that dath ilan wants out of its very smart people who are smarter than the other people The sort of thing where if you say Im Kelthams they take that at face value and go talk to Keltham though I did not myself see that at the time because I am still very much trying to locate in concept space what it means that you gave yourself to me

Yes very respectful Isidre sure is that Well see thats the complicating bit right that you didnt actually sign up for being in any sense responsible for me So I feel respected but also you should definitely feel free to say I continue to delegate Carissa optimization to Carissa you didnt acquire an obligation to do it

What does it mean to you that I gave myself to you

That my brain continually feels like its wavering on some sort of huge ledge and I am constantly wondering which things I am to do with you and which not and which decisions youre supposed to make for yourself and Im supposed to make for you Because you still think Carissa on some deep level that I grew up in Golarion that of course I must know what you really mean that it should be obvious and because its obvious its fine not to be legible 

That I have to figure out for myself what I actually want from you since I dont have the excuse and easy way out of just asking you what youre willing to give and that I guess Ill see where that takes me Keltham answers out loud Its also obviously this huge act of loyalty trust something I dont have words for and it impresses me and makes me wish that I understood all the connotations everything that somebody from Golarion would take for granted so that I could appreciate better exactly what that act means and stop being terrified that its real meaning is owing you something I cant pay back

Lean Well theres no hurry And I can try to explain except I dont know exactly where to start I already explained the bits that are really obvious and the rest is probably you know fire elementals dont know what fire is

Isidre allegedly has some idea of what fire is But among the many many things I didnt ask her and shouldve when I had the chance was Wait so am I allowed to just directly say all this to Carissa and ask her about it or do you predict something bad happens if I do that

Oh I bet she knows what fire is 

 what kind of bad thing are you thinking of

As the saying goes knowledge of the bad thing that happens to you if you hear the dangerous information is often the same dangerous information I mean not for book spoilers maybe but for a lot of the more serious stuff Id have to go through it all piece by piece to figure out if there were any exceptions to that 

Im being evasive Why am I being evasive

Im being evasive because thinking about what Isidre said requires my romantic and libido parts to be booted up to think about it properly and those parts are not presently booted

Do I endorse that answer Yes I endorse it

 okay That seems bad for Cheliaxs goals Also confusing Carissa is pretty sure that when one feels vulnerable and confused then one is much more inclined to have sex though thats the kind of thought where now that shes thought it she can notice probably isnt a human universal and is probably instead the kind of thing that might divide people by whether they like being hit or not Do you want a massage I think that is the standard sort of thing thats nice even when one isnt in the mood and can get one into it

I have some sort of guilt feelings youre going to tell me I shouldnt have because its not the point and then the feelings arent going to go away that youre a topnotch weapons specialist who gave herself to me to make anything I wanted of her and instead of making you into a better weapons specialist whose creations can destroy fifty demons per second Im getting a massage from you

 so I hesitate to describe my ideal endgame here because Im very worried that youre going to like take it as if I dont achieve that then I wronged Carissa by taking her up on it in the first place which is not the point at all But my ideal endgame here is that we build a dath ilani city in conquered Nidal and get all the modern conveniences Civilization invents before anyone else and I have so much spellsilver I can do every project that comes to mind as soon as it does and I make us immortal though we can still visit Hell sometimes maybe have a vacation place in Dis and sometimes you have a very spirited try at hurting me until I say no and you cant do it

Id expect you to warn me in advance if I was getting close to making you say no and not just struggle to get away if I hadnt otherwise rescinded that order by then That is not something I am ready to fight my brain about right now And even if that changes I suspect I still might find it hot

It actually does help that you have and know any possible endgame it helps my brain believe that you werent just stepping into a vast empty void that it is my sole task to fill like a and once again Taldane does not have the word computer programmer god Im not sure you grasp quite how little I know about what a Carissa Sevar could maybe possibly probably be thinking

If this works at all youre going to be incredibly rich and powerful Like ninety nine percent of the female population of Golarion I like it when men are rich and powerful and I am better at extrapolating than most of them And I know what I would do with wealth and power because I am a wizard and wizards are very good at turning money into ridiculously cool magic stuff though also if you get bored and drop me in a month I wont feel cheated I have too much Chelish dignity to be upset about not getting something which never belonged to me

That sounds like a piece of the dignity that would exist in my world maybe The world of Kelthams Like how I didnt think that Civilization owed me any appreciation unless I could force that

I keep poking my brain if its ready for a massage and my brain keeps insisting that its beneath you and Im trying to decide whether I should execute the tried and true response of blowing up my brain with explody things and just getting the massage

I assume it would be pushing you too far in confusion about how Chelish dating works and uncertainty about who is getting paid what if we ordered Pilar in here to give you a massage while I watched and showed you a bit of complicated spell scaffolding

That would induce confusion about Chelish dating yes Why Pilar in particular and not say Meritxell

Pilars here everyone else is all the way in Ostenso I dont know if youre important enough to get someone teleported in to give you a massage during a war when were using all our teleport capacity for logistics

Because they did the resurrect here I feel like I should have seen that answer without having to ask it Anyways Ive been advised by Isidre that I am Not Ready For Pilar

Oh right this seems safe to say After the very strange thing happened to Pilar Isidre got a hunch and asked Security to ask a few questions Pilar has a fetish for being forced or as Isidre put it a rape fetish a term I assume has some interpretation other than wanting unwanted sex which is not outright self contradictory and its an obligate fetish to the point where shed feel actually raped if I made her talk about sex before having it with her

I infer though it was not said explicitly oh my ass Taldane how you can you take that many syllables to say that people would just not say it that this was the point at which Isidre decided to come over and futilely attempt to find out exactly why I think one of the girls is secretly some kind of traitor possibly without knowing it herself

Pilars not really the ideal person anyway If the way Keltham works is that he has a hard time abusing girls he respects then the obvious thing is to try to get him in bed with a girl he doesnt respect but all the research harem are at least reasonably competent and she cant think of an obvious excuse for him to be introduced to a new useless girl

Huh So she asked Pilar noticed it matched and thought you were onto something with the mysterious logic above the gods you cant explain to us And its usually just a fetish for not being in a position to refuse or for it not mattering if you want it rather than for not wanting it I think

Yeah basically I gave Isidre some other guesses of what that logic said about some other things and theres a test we could run sort of but its a strange one and to consider it I have to boot my sexuality Which seems to be noticeably stirring in response to the Pilar discussion Non self contradictory version Brain really Yes really The thought of getting a massage from you now seems notably more appealing

Oh uh meta comment the thing Im doing now where I think out loud more in front of you when were in private is because youre my girlfriend and get more access to my thought processes

Okay Carissa does actually need to urgently seek correction at some point about how much she likes Keltham not because its going to inspire her to betrayal she really isnt worried about that at all and assumes they arent either but because having such an unAsmodean impulse twenty times a day definitely breaks other things and she needs to know which other things and get them corrected as quickly as possible 

That is a very sweet policy I like it I can try to think out loud more in front of you as well

Its not actually easy dath ilani only make it look easy Itll take practice and in particular one of the first skills youll need to learn is the ability to say Wrongthought meaning Wait that isnt what I was actually thinking because the words that come out of your mouth will be different from the thoughts you actually thought

 huh Well Ill try it Maybe on my own at first unless you want to see me try it but I do expect itll be a bit harder to learn with an audience

Oh thats probably a good idea if you havent had any anticonformity training yeah

Im not sure how much resistance a Chelish adult has to falsely believing that theyre thinking the things that they think the people around them want them to be thinking But like I kinda suspect the massive amount of counter training we dath ilani got as kids was actually doing something

Hmm do you think

I havent had anticonformity training yeah and appreciate the warning this is something you might do to us because wow it sounds kind of nightmarish in the same way as having the Queen show up to mock you for your thoughts from the transcripts shes reading Except in the opposite direction so getting both at once is double nightmarish

Theres genuinely something terrifying there something that feels like realizing youre not standing over solid ground but on a tightrope over the Abyss

Or like noticing you could peel all your skin off Its true but did you really need to notice it

Of course most thoughts are the thoughts youre supposed to have 

How about a change of subject

Well when it comes to having girls by force I think there are actually more women with that fetish than men who want to fulfill it so maybe you can have fun without handwringing about the market value of the experience youre getting for free Or maybe you can charge though the specific nature of the fetish does make it seem hard to do that

Keltham forbears to point out that this is not plausibly an evolutionarily stable mating market equilibrium Hes made his point its time to give it a rest

I dont think its obtaining by force maybe more like having them struggle inside their chains Possible logistical difficulties there sexually speaking but logistical difficulties are there in life to be solved

Though I think I should not attempt for a fair while to do that with anyone who is not following an order saying that they cannot verbally argue with me to be let out which I suspect rules out Pilar outright even apart from Isidres warning Or maybe Im wrong about how that would work

Also I think Im actually ready for that massage now

Oh good That was the goal Carissa will start on that massage Yeah I think if where youre at is that you need the girl to not be arguing with you then thats fine for now but it rules out Pilar based on what you said and probably lots of other girls who wont feel wronged but wont know what youre playing at Perhaps you will have to require introductory classes on dath ilanism before anyone is comprehensible enough you can fuck them without getting horribly confused

Dath ilani ends up in alternate universe trains the most intelligent people around him in dath ilanism so he has a pool of compatible sex partners Yeah I dont think that book would turn into a bestselling novel anytime soon

Why not Id read it But really I think this is the premise of a romance novel marketed to women Powerful man from another world comes to transform your own happens to be incredibly sexually unfulfilled and want you in particular thats a female fantasy Most authors dont have much imagination and just make him a Duke but its the same principle The massage was a good idea Keltham totally has some muscle tension

Shes pretty okay at massage for somebody whose civilization obviously never gave her a single training class on how any of it works and may not even collectively know This will probably have a net positive effect

Civilizations got some different romance novels gotta say Veeerrrryyy different Going on recently popular media a stereotypically standard female appealing fantasy would be to find that theyre secretly the daughter and heiress to a Dark Unilateral Ruler in an alternate universe with economicmagic that lets the Dark Ruler run the entire place as a criminal mastermind with a Corrupted Governance that makes everybody believe that most people elected her when actually they didnt and now the new Dark Heiress has got to pretend to act like an Evil supervillain for an extended period and navigate a complex and chaotic web of criminal personalities to end up with a harem of four men each with distinct powers and personalities on her way to either seizing or inheriting the Dark Rulership

 okay I think thatd be a hit in Cheliax too but for some reason which no doubt youll diagnose down the line the actual romances Ive had the misfortune to pick up have all been much worse than that Also probably dath ilan would consider literally all our rulers even the very capable ones to be Dark Unilateral Rulers

Your Queens not unilateral according to Isidre she had to coordinate with Asmodeus to take over Cheliax and now has to keep track of how much political capital she has with the Church of Asmodeus

Also remember these are romance novels for Intelligence 17 women being written by Intelligence 24 women Im not sure how much diagnosing of the difference actually remains to be diagnosed after that

 yeah I guess thats probably sufficient And sure Cheliax has a Dark Alliance between Her Imperial Majestrix and the Lawful Evil god Asmodeus though if they disagree on anything its not very visible to their subjects Most of the time

I am worried that your Alliance is not quite Dark enough frankly based on interacting with Isidre and hearing some of her concerns about how much fun the Queen isnt having Very smart people in dath ilan tend to lean Good The obvious potential problem with that if not otherwise averted is that when you care about a very large number of people you can end up with very large numbers inside your mental decision processes and especially the parts that do abstract thinking That can produce thoughts at edges and vertices of the space of thoughts extremes you wouldnt get with a more naturally selfish person where the weights dont go much larger than the weights they put on themselves

Now this to be clear is a problem you have to solve with more Law rather than less Law If its a predictable fact that certain ways of thinking are going to make certain mistakes predict it and then dont make the mistakes If a Good person ends up thinking its a good idea to break an oath and go to Abaddon in order to save some larger number of other people from going to Abaddon they could imaginably be right by their own measures in which case theres no arguing with the utility function values that entities assign to final outcomes But I would far more expect to observe that Good people end up systematically mistaken about how much good oathbreaking really does for example because of the further consequences of people not being able to trust Good peoples oaths any more or anyones oaths because that person might be secretly Good or just because Good people usually and systematically end up not saving as many people as they hoped with the sacrifices they make

If you have a lot of very smart Good people they can train each other out of mistakes like that I doubt Golarion even bothers to collect statistics on the kind of mistakes that very smart people make

And the other thing about Civilization is that we do not often have to worry about fifteen percent of the population dying There are not millions of people in fixable seeming horrible situations and if there were you would be working on it with a lot of other people rather than nearly alone Which probably helps a bunch in practice to keep our smart Good people from ending up at weird extremes without them having to be incredibly Lawful about that

To a dath ilani Isidre reads strongly as someone with overly large problems to worry about insufficient Law by dath ilani standards and an intelligence headband too much more powerful than the headbands of the people around her

Did he think that at Abrogail Carissa bets he thought that at Abrogail and she feels this is the best thing that ever happened even though objectively its probably bad for her interest in being of no interest to the Queen 

 that makes sense I have never heard the Queen called Good but I guess maybe a project like hers attracts Good advisors Though her primary advisors are sent straight from Hell probably because thats one of the only ways around this problem in Golarion

Then the Queens advisors may not know may have forgotten how humans actually work in some ways which is another problem Isidre was trying to optimize over Should he actually be discussing the Queen a lot with Carissa if there is a huge not yet defused Carissa Aborgail interaction bomb that might not be tropetarily inevitable I have noticed an ulterior motive to change the subject about this can we go back to talking about fetishes or romance

Yes absolutely Do you want me to just list various things that people with your taste sometimes like and then you can decide if you like them or not

Maaaybe go a little slowly on me and just list like one more Partially for internal speed limit reasons and partially because not spoiling the fun by finding out it exists too far ahead of when you can do it

Okay one more Having a girl blindfolded and deafened so she has no idea whats happening around her except when you touch her

I was going to say thats also a thing that has ever occurred to dath ilani to try focusing on touch instead of other senses But Im realizing that in a sadistic context and maybe one where you are blindfolded and chained this is a very different concept

Libido has started all the way back up mysteriously there are physiological signs of this which Keltham is not bothering to verbally observe because he expects Carissa can decode the way he just shifted and adjusted his position on the bed Golarion beds sure are ill suited to being a massage table on top of all their other ill suited functions I request quiet but continued massage while I try to consider some things Isidre said

She nods silently and proceeds silently and imagines Contessa Lrilatha telling Abrogail to leave Carissa alone because that must be thats pretty much what Abrogail said happened How would that even go Would you go find a couple dozen other Carissas to distract Abrogail with Poor dozen other Carissas who didnt have the good sense to be in the right place at the right time 

She hopes theyre not statues Thats not entertainment at the misfortune of another thatd just be sad

Thats not heretical right Wanting every soul to find its way to Asmodeus

Keltham tries to figure out how hed feel about telling the Chelish government well not to give him Carissa or else because like that is stupid on so many different levels both as decision theory and as a trap that Isidre could be setting for him if she was less than absolutely trustworthy Please give him Carissa permanently or until he gives her back to do with as he pleases and have that be the regulation of Cheliax and not just an arrangement between the two of them formalizing what Carissa gave him informally as Carissa herself wants according to your very smart people and in return Keltham charges Cheliax very very slightly less of their GDP increase or some such

Its not particularly landing at this point

In a world with Pilars Keltham can see somehow not with the eyes of dath ilan but with the eyes of his own sexuality that had no place available for it in dath ilan in a way that wasnt anyones fault Keltham can see how there could be a submissivewoman gender subtrope that is like being pursued and dated but more so He can imagine how that gender subtrope of woman might think it was more romantic for a man to desire her so much that he came in and just took her away paying costs to do that but never asking The question of how this ends up with the right people matched and without giant flaming obvious incentive problems if a man likes a woman who doesnt like him back may perhaps rest on Golarion institutions unknown to him or it may be a reason why this desire unsatisfiable in reality is fed mainly by Golarion romance novels

He can imagine that Carissa wants that even if hes pretty sure hes not imagining it correctly true to the real Carissa Sevar its enough to explain why a possible person would want that To be in metaphorical bed chains in her larger social and legal situation chains that she wears always as proof that a man wanted her that much

Carissa wants it lets suppose that to be true does that situation appeal to Keltham himself

 not really The part where Carissa gives herself to him feels deeper and more meaningful to him than that choice being taken away from Carissa so that Keltham no longer knows shes still making it Its a choice that says Keltham is worthy that he and his sexuality are worth so much to Carissa that she has judged him and chosen him even though she could have had another that he is valuable to Carissa in a way he was not so valuable to any woman in dath ilan

Is there some way you still get that in full measure if somebody is with you because they cant escape within Golarion and have opted not to escape to the afterlife

Keltham isnt seeing it for now Maybe his thoughts are being too crystalline and logical about it too denying of subtleties and forcing it all into well but then therefore where people could just opt to not conclude that therefore Maybe there is a way that Keltham can know Carissa still finds him worthy even as she lives truly in the world where she has no other choice Well Like the Detect Desires spell for example If you have that around for people who can afford it then it is obviously going to change some things 

SHIT

Does Isidre do that to the people around her Cast Detect Desires around them or have it cast by a cleric who reports to her and maybe not a cleric of Asmodeus either

Keltham is trying not to believe it too hard but his brain just shouted very loudly YES SHE DOES because Isidre knows far too much about what various people want And it is extremely the sort of deontology violation that youd expect from a Good person with a deficit of Law an overly powerful intelligence headband and horrifying problems that are horrifically large Isidre would reason that the privacy violation was just not really that important on the scale of twenty million people and even if her intelligence headband lets her fake some intuitive shadow of the Law of Coordination she might still argue to herself that knowing more true facts about somebody is not something that ought to cause a breakdown of coordination Keltham isnt even sure shes wrong he doesnt have her problems Call it 75 probability

But suppose Carissa is fine with Detect Desires being used on her Though maybe that aspect has to be illegible so Carissa doesnt have to admit to herself that she could escape by wanting to be free well leave aside the deontology violation of doing it without asking suppose the thought experiment anyways Or maybe Carissa says Keltham is entitled to Detect Desires her and truthspell her whenever he wants because that is part of what it means to give herself to him and they never have to make mutually legible why or whether Keltham is doing that

Consider that Least Convenient Possible World for the argument against putting Carissa in a situation where the absolute power Keltham thinks the Taldane word in Baseline that Keltham has over her has been formally materialized and made real The world where Keltham casts Detect Desires every morning or multiple times per day because Least Convenient Possible World and the spell always says that Carissa still wants him and judges him worthy and would have him hold absolute power over her

Then what

Then Keltham does not really see the added appeal from his perspective but it is not obviously or not legibly obviously something he couldnt do for Carissa to make her happier at little cost to himself

Except for where his mind just screamed that he is tilting further on that dangerous narrow ledge he is standing upon And also Isidre warned him not to have that done to Carissa unless he wanted it for himself

Keltham doing it because Carissa wants it is probably not what Carissa wants either The Golarion womans romance novel is about the man who wants you that much in that way and not because he thinks it is something you need to be happy

Maybe someday Keltham will come to feel for himself the thing that is the male complement of the gender subtrope that Carissa has where he wants for himself to make that absolute power real and cast Detect Desires as a guardrail around it and make it so that if Carissa cant stop wanting him then she cant stop having him either Maybe someday hell understand better the grounds he stands on in Golarion and it will no longer seem like something that would get you kicked out of most cities in dath ilan well no not actually theyre just not going to do that to you in dath ilan if Carissa is standing there saying get the fuck out of our private business Civilization I dont need you to protect me No victim no crime as the proverb goes So it isnt like that But maybe someday it will stop feeling like that

Also Civilization would what would they even think of a situation where Carissa is going Let me out Civilization I dont want to be here anymore to test the bounds of the chains placed on her and be reassured that they are real and Detect Desires is showing that Carissa wants desperately for Civilization to laugh maniacally and say No you belong to Keltham now

Keltham is sad he will never get to subsidize this question in a voting prediction market He really wants to know what Civilization would think of it Well no actually he wants to see the enormous flamewar and Very Serious People shouting at each other that would happen if this question really came up But also he wants to know what Civilization would think of it

What does the Kelthamverse think of it

 The Kelthamverse is what three days old at this point The Kelthamverse knows that it is a tiny baby world and wants to refer the question back to Civilization so that it has a good starting point

But mostly this thoughtsearch has reached quiescence there is not much expected value of logical information in searching further Keltham finds no desire within himself for his own sake to transform Carissas free gift to him into a metaphorical chain that she wears always and for him to do it for her sake is almost surely not what Carissa wants He will reopen the question when and if he finds within himself that gender subtrope that is complement to Carissas

And meanwhile he is not going to say anything to Carissa that sounds like Never forget youve got the right to leave at any time because that would be stupid

Its somewhat nervewracking knowing Keltham is thinking and having no idea what hes thinking being totally unsure whether at any moment hell say great okay I resolved all my internal Good training go crawl into the fire or hey was that Isidre secretly the Queen of Cheliax in disguise it was inferrable from several things she said or Ive decided Cheliax is too Good can we relocate operations to Razmiran or actually coming up with scary things Keltham might say isnt a productive thing to be doing What if instead she tries to understand magnetism so she can be impressive next time they try Prestidigitation and then whatever happens will happen Give up hope and endure

Carissa meta question if I suspect Isidre of doing something that might or might not be incredibly criminal in Cheliax maybe it is maybe its the sort of thing people like her are quietly expected to do is that something I talk to you about

Wow thats substantially worse than crawl into the fire 

 at the Worldwound you are obligated to report things like that to a different Lawful church if you think your own might fail to handle it Here I guess talking to me about it is a reasonable thing to do let me think if theres a reason not to tell me 

Are they going to have to escape 

I think you should tell me

Isidre knows way too much about what various people want and this isnt dath ilan so the people around her dont have a good sense of what you cant do with just an intelligence headband I suspect Isidre of having somebody maybe a cleric not of Asmodeus casting Detect Desires and reporting to her If shes not that cleric herself come to think or maybe its also a wizard spell I didnt think to ask 

Anyways Im at 75 probability thats what she does and thats taking into account how little I know

Targets would have included you Pilar maybe me if Asmodeus didnt specifically direct otherwise and possibly I am less sure about this part the Queen of Cheliax

Even in Taldor 

 but old Cheliax is Taldor new Cheliax is Asmodeuss 

 safer not to lie Except for how everything is a lie Carissa has never found lying to be difficult before and these days its like navigating a dungeon blindfolded 

The fact that Cheliax could mind control Keltham and hasnt is useful evidence of good faith and also shes already told him that but also making it clear that Keltham wouldnt notice if sufficiently powerful people did it makes it impossible to preserve an escape avenue where Keltham concludes theres a rot that doesnt extend to the top 

 Im going to start by saying things Im very sure of and then get to things Im less sure of she says So invasive divinations by default feel like something its possible to notice them happening to you Probably uh Contessa Lrilatha or the Queen herself could cast an invasive divination you couldnt even detect they could also do mind control that felt like your own choices but anyone much less powerful than that would be running a reasonably high chance that their targets would notice Unless there are some powerful secret magic items involved which there might be

When you cast Detect Desires on me I felt it and I couldve attempted to fight you off and probably succeeded We should make sure you know what that feeling is and that you havent felt it at any time in the last couple of days Strongly predict you havent though When the priest on duty at the Worldwound first got a revelation from Asmodeus about you his instructions to me suggested that Asmodeus had very firmly prohibited a very wide class of things including some we dont even think of as bad behavior with respect to you

I havent noticed unexpected invasive divinations or enchantments cast on me though I consented to a truth spell and some invasive divinations for Security screening for this project and Im third circle not fourth that makes a substantial difference in how powerful youd need to be to be sure I wouldnt notice And Pilars second which makes her even easier to hit and Pilar mightve agreed to screening for various weird things when she got back from Elysium because shed spent a bunch of time around Chaotic outsiders 

Trying to cast an invasive divination on the Queen of Cheliax is definitely an incredibly serious crime like they would execute you on the spot after making sure you werent spying for somebody sort of crime I think trying to cast an invasive divination on people involved in a secret project would be considered a big deal also I it might be one of those things where the Church and the Crown arent entirely on the same page

It is definitely the kind of thing youd report at the Worldwound

Somewhat reassuring and also in retrospect I shouldnt have said 75 for Detect Desires that was too narrow a hypothesis rookie cognitive error magical items sure maybe a function on that irreplaceable relic headband Or is there something thats like Foxs Cunning Owls Wisdom Eagles Splendour but for reading people 

True not that damning sort of inconvenient to admit but Kelthams already noticed a bunch of its correlates in various places 

 yeah There is Uh not a spell but there are magic items for it and its a stereotype about nobles that theyre all ridiculously enhanced at it 

That would plausibly be it yeah I dont know what it cant do And if its legal and not considered socially unacceptable then Isidre seems like the sort of person whos extremely likely to get the most powerful version of it that exists

Well Maybe I ran ahead too far of my inference speed limit there too influenced by the trope where you walk up to somebody and grimly say Im sorry but Im afraid you know too much and then prove that they couldnt have reached their conclusions from only the information they were supposed to have It would be more likely that Isidre was doing something undetectable and legal than that she was doing something incredibly illegal and where she might get caught

Of course dath ilan has stories about that and finds a special joy in discovering and uncovering it 

Abandon hope and endure

No Win

Im still not sure what a trope is but yeah Id expect someone in her position is much much likelier to be achieving her results with powerful magic that no one really objects to it works just as well if the other person has Mind Blank up which is the intuitive line between just being uncannily good at looking and using invasive magic 

Mind Blank

Eighth circle incredibly powerful abjuration that provides approximately categorical protection against divinations and enchantments targeting you You cant get around it with a Wish thats how powerful it is If someone tries to scry the room youre in the room will appear but you wont If someone casts Detect Intelligence theyll detect all intelligent minds in the area except yours

And theres magic items of it but they cost eight million gold pieces and who knows they might be cursed

I actually dont even know a magic item of it to exist at all but if it did itd certainly be priceless

And it cant possibly be what it sounds like but Ill ask anyways just in case Wish

Does what you ask for which is very bad and dangerous and there are organizations thatll kill you if they suspect youre trying to use a Wish There are known safe phrasings for like fifteen twenty things very powerful things but not nearly as powerful as the spells capable of but if you try something theres not a known safe phrasing for extremely bad things will definitely happen

Combo with twenty Auguries Keltham says before it occurs to him that maybe he shouldnt be giving ideas like that away

Duplicating auguries doesnt work you get the same answer But there are more powerful spells for talking to ones god like Commune and ninth circle wizards with an INT of 30 do occasionally advisedly cast powerful Wishes which I assume is how we got the known safe phrasings we do have

How the flaming noodles do you get to INT 30 even with a 6 Intelligence headband youd have to start from INT 24 which is dath ilan 3 and then that takes you to dath ilan 6 Im not sure we even have anybody whos actually that smart and not just a measurement breaking down If anyone here is that smart and not restricted from communicating like gods are restricted Golarion shouldnt exist

One of the known safe wordings of a Wish is intelligence enhancement Just 1 you need a chain of five Wishes cast in immediate sequence to get 5 and thats the most Wishes cast in sequence attested in all of history So youd have to start from 19 and we dont throw one of those often but in all of history we have I dont know why having INT 30 didnt cause them to solve everything wrong in the world maybe INT 30 doesnt actually perfectly correspond to the dath ilan 6

That was a thought that had occurred to me earlier yeah but with people supposedly INT 30 running around I feel a lot more credence in that thought That Detect Intelligence isnt measuring everything that dath ilan thinks of as intelligence and that the spells and headbands only enhance what wed see as one relatively narrow aspect of intelligence Dath ilan separates smartness into a lot of factors I suspect what you call Intelligence and Wisdom together would be like three of seven main ones or some such

Somebody with general smartness 30 and not just Intelligence 30 should shred apart the reality of Golarion as they walk through it I dont think theres any way you can be that generally smart and not figure out like the idea of selection on heritable variation

That could be Though also maybe Archmage Nex a thousand years ago figured out selection on heritable variation but didnt uh tell everybody because who knows if itd have suited him And theres no one that smart around now

Whats the current highest INT If theres Detect Intelligence then is there also a Detect Wisdom spell Whats the average Wisdom of a wizard tracked student with Intelligence 18

Probably the smartest person alive is Nefreti Clepati the seventh circle wizard and ninth circle cleric of Nethys who heads the church of Nethys in Sothis Shes Nethys touched so by all accounts sort of insane and probably has like a 26 for both intelligence and wisdom though I dont know for sure I havent met her There is also a Detect Wisdom spell and wisdom is a tiny bit higher than average for wizard tracked students but not that much higher maybe 12 wisdom increases over the course of your life though unlike Intelligence so itd be higher if you were looking at those same people at age 25

Anything else on the same level as Intelligence and Wisdom that Nefreti also has a 26 in

Not that Ive heard advertised but again I havent met her and one of the few stories I know about her are that she caused a massive explosion that flattened the temple of Nethys in Sothis and Nethys gave her several more cleric levels for it

Sounds like a kinda cool god frankly That said Im never praying to him

In Kelthams mind a hypothesis is taking shape a mental model

To a Chelish eavesdropper it would look like rather a lot of Seeing the idea as a dath ilani sees it compactly and at a glance requires a grasp of underlying math If Keltham wanted to say it to Carissa he would need to spell out rather a lot of things and also use a whiteboard

Kelthams thought revolves around a standard dath ilani concept that Taldane has no word for Intelligence translated into this word in Baseline but Keltham is starting to suspect that this reflects a mistake that Carissa and other language donors are making not a translation accurate in the world For translation purposes one must then fix a new term

Call this one thinkoomph

Thinkoomph is optimization as done by humans Its figure of merit is correct prediction choice of action leading to desired outcomes the power of inner thoughts over the outer world the power of cognition to apprehend and effectuate reality Of course humans do this in a weird idiosyncratic way and a random possible simple optimizer that was about as powerful as an average dath ilani would not understand and manipulate reality in the same way as an average dath ilani But if everyone involved is a human then to speak of thinkoomph as a thing humans do whose figure of merit is optimization is not too unsensible a concept

Keltham does not need to think about this part right now he has already chunked the notion of thinkoomph long ago Thinkoomph is a view into the processes that humans do to produce optimization viewed from the standpoint where its purpose is optimization and where the information theoretic goal of the viewpoint youre taking is to make it easy to describe those usual variations among humans that contribute to the variations in their optimization power

Thinkoomph then is not a single number but a structure with some internals But it happens to be empirically the case that a lot of usefully discussable smartness components map not too terribly onto a unidimensional line such that holding the rest of a mind constant you get more optimization power as you move up along the line

For ease of visualization then consider thinkoomph as a seven dimensional thing because it happens that theres a useful component analysis like that in dath ilan which gives you seven dimensions

Or consider thinkoomph as a machine with seven gears each of varying size if you dont want to visualize seven dimensional objects for some weird reason

Suppose Detect Intelligence gives you an imperfect partial view of thinkoomph thats made up of say 1 speed clarity of information retrieval plus 2 how much information you can maintain in short term memory Detect Wisdom gives you an imperfect partial view of 3 the piece of thinkoomph thats perceptual clarity which critically has a subpiece 3a that is clarity and detail and accuracy of introspection Which is to say shifting viewpoints from the machinery to the result that machinery produces that Detect Wisdom imperfectly measures the machinery that grinds to produce reflection

In dath ilan the proverb poem goes Beware lest what you can measure easily becomes all that you measure beware lest it become all that you optimize beware lest it become all that you ever think of

The people of Golarion know how to Detect Intelligence and Detect Wisdom and thats it So they think there are two components of thinkoomph They invent two spells to boost the thing that Detect Intelligence detects and the thing that Detect Wisdom detects

They invent headbands to boost the thing that Detect Intelligence detects The amount the headband sells for depends on how large of a shift it produces in that handy spell Detect Intelligence which as everyone in Golarion knows detects Intelligence If the Detect Intelligence spell says that a headband produces a 3 to Intelligence its worth less money than if Detect Intelligence says that the headband produces 4 to intelligence

Imagine now that nobody has invented Detect Wisdom yet just Detect Intelligence Imagine that somebody with a vision of broader thinkoomph builds a new headband that would if you could also run Detect Wisdom show to produce a 3 to Intelligence and a 3 to Wisdom This headband is probably more expensive to build than the one that produces 4 to Intelligence probably by a lot and the Detect Intelligence spell says that it produces an inferior result than the 4 headband So nobody builds a headband like that if they dont have Detect Wisdom

Does either Intelligence or Wisdom incorporate creativity outside the box solutions outside the box hypotheses Maybe when Keltham dares to try on an intelligence headband if he ever so dares itll be immediately apparent to him that this headband boosts every part of cognition that Owls Wisdom didnt boost But Keltham is guessing that this will prove to not be the case

Consider then the world in which Golarion has a Detect Intelligence spell and a Detect Wisdom spell but these are only 3 out of 7 components of cognition

Its not the kids with highest thinkoomph who get tracked to be wizards Its the kids with the highest Detected Intelligence

It is of course famously true that in humans and describing humans is what the concept of thinkoomph is all about most things you can measure about thinkoomphs components or outputs will all correlate with each other quite a lot The kids with Intelligence 14 which Keltham thinks was supposed to be the wizard tracking threshold do tend to have Wisdom 12 rather than Wisdom 10 But if you were looking not at random at somebody with Intelligence 14 selected on high Intelligence and asking what are the rest of their thinkoomph components like then the rest are probably more like what their Wisdom score happened to be

When you select on kids with high Detected Intelligence youre not just selecting for kids with high general thinkoomph levels that produce high Intelligence along the way youre selecting for kids whose Intelligence is unusually high compared to the rest of their thinkoomph Thats why the Wisdom comes out as 12 instead of 14

Dath ilan has heritage optimized itself over generations in full awareness of how all these measurement and optimization gotchas work They are doing their best to measure real world results broadly and doing genetics and statistics to them Dath ilan does not want to end up testing some weird projection of thinkoomph that originally started out correlated with thinkoomph optimizing over this weird projection and ending up with optimized things that have much more of the weird projected quality than they have thinkoomph Dath ilan wants actual thinkoomph and is explicitly not pursuing it the stupid way

So youve got your kid with Intelligence 18 and Wisdom 14 and they get wizard tracked and get a 6 intelligence headband or maybe if they become spectacularly successful a relic with 6 Intelligence and 4 Wisdom and if theyre incredibly insanely successful they get 2 or 3 layered Wish spells on top of that They end up say with 27 Intelligence and 21 Wisdom in dath ilani terms those subcomponents of thinkoomph would now be at 45sd and 15sd respectively

But their other 4 out of 7 thinkoomph characteristics are still around 14 or in dath ilani terms if the scales match 2sd Golarionites dont know how to easily measure these other components they dont try to boost them they dont think about them

This sounds a lot more like a model consistent with Golarion than the model where anyone with 6 thinkoomph has literally ever existed here You dont need training to be a Keeper at 6 thinkoomph you just are one

Inside Kelthams mind this is all a much shorter and better chunked thing to think what he thinks roughly is Hey maybe they got Goodharts Cursed on Intelligence and Wisdom metrics

Only Kelthams actual thought is that thinkoomph is the underlying true value Intelligence and Wisdom are imperfect proxy measures of thinkoomph optimization over Intelligence and Wisdom will select not just on thinkoomph but on upward divergence of measured Intelligence and Wisdom scores from underlying thinkoomph scores that this applies both to selecting students for wizard tracking and for boosting them with Intelligence headbands later and that this will of course produce people who may detect as 4 Intelligence and 4 Wisdom but who started with something like 2 or 1 underlying general abstracted correlation of thinkoomph components and now have something more like 1 final optimization power as a result of all that Intelligence and Wisdom boosting

Nobody with 6 thinkoomph has ever walked through this place Theyd shred it around themselves like tissue paper

Putting a pin in something to follow up on later Keltham says after the few seconds it takes for him to think the compact version of the thought Detect my Wisdom if its 20 thats very bad news for your heritage optimization project and makes my heritage substantially more valuable If my Wisdom is 14 thats much better news for you Underlying reasoning behind that statement is gonna take a drawing wall though

Do Wishes by any chance need to be spoken in a strange inhuman language Wreaking total havoc if you state things the least bit incorrectly seems obviously reminiscent of bare metal systems programming

A couple of the known safe wordings are Taldane The others are other things but other human languages I think

Can you invent an artificial language and say a Wish in that

 probably but youd be starting without any known safe wordings so 

 look I am sure dath ilan has an equivalent to this uh a thing where smart people immediately start thinking of a clever way to do it that will get around all the things theyve been told might go wrong but the clever way will also go wrong and maybe well eventually be able to use Wishes to do stuff but I think you are lacking the background of how everyone always tries to come up with a clever way to use Wishes to solve their problems and they sound like theyll work fine and then they dont and its a disaster which youd have if you were from Golarion And its not that I dont want to rewrite the fabric of reality just by speaking aloud Id love to

Carissa I wasnt considering doing that on any remotely near term timescale Im not completely shitpooping insane I was just curious if anybody had maybe already tried the thing that a dath ilani thinks of in half a second namely casting Wishes with a real actual proper specification language

Or maybe thats overkill and all you need is Baseline instead of flaming Taldane Keltham isnt betting on it hes not going to try it but he sure is thinking it

Okay Just we have uh maybe a trope about people going oh I thought of a clever way to do safe Wishes no one tried before shortly before theres a smoking crater a Teleport distance across Asking questions is fine I dont know anyone to have tried that

Dont do anything that would make Broom give me a sad look got it

 though this smoking crater business again sounds like a result you would absolutely get if what you needed was a programming language for bare metal systems programming and what you used was spoken colloquial Taldane

To be fair if thats true its a puzzle why any Wish works let alone asking for an Intelligence boost

Maybe hell look into known safe wordings and unsafe wordings and check if theres anything really really obvious going on there if the person reading it is a computer programmer

 maybe he is being a typical dath ilani male in a certain way and he should stop doing that I think I should maybe focus on the massage for a bit relax again and think about Isidres other sexuality requiring cognitive challenge posed to me So far Ive done one of two

All right She was kind of hoping that Keltham would be annoyed about her being argumentative at him but either he wasnt or it just didnt occur to him that if youre annoyed at your girlfriend who belongs to you you can hit her about it Oh well

Massage in silence it is

After a bit of silence relaxing again mentally leaning into the massage and yes very briefly poking some internal curiosity about what exactly it is that is Pilars obligate fetish precisely speaking Keltham returns to contemplating more sexual questions

How does he feel about renting Carissa out

 mostly hes still getting a WHAT from his brain

Can he evaluate it concretely rather than abstractly

Not without having actually met the Queen of Cheliax at all

Okay but Keltham does know some people He even knows some female people in case this is a polarized gendertrope with respect to the renting individual How does Keltham feel about renting Carissa to his max mutual wordcount coauthor from his fic circle back in dath ilan who happens to possess the requisite parts

 sad about never writing anything with her again also shes proooobably not a sadist like at all also maybe it actually is not a terribly good idea to think right now about people who believe hes Truly Dead

Keltham knows some female people inside a totally different universe that is not that universe He doesnt know them very well but he can ask himself the concrete question anyways What if he were to rent Carissa to say Tonia Barrero in repayment of the debt he owes her for an unexpected un volunteered in advance at best semi consensual truthspelling

Still file not found here he doesnt know Tonia well enough

Keltham knows what to do in this cognitive situation For purposes of testing this function keep supplying imaginary values to the Tonia structure until he can complete the function call If at any point he gets a negative result he can then tweak values to see if theres any value that produces a positive result instead and then hell also know what properties hes looking for

Let Tonia be a sadist but like a young sadist whos only slightly more experienced there than Keltham and in no danger of providing Carissa with an unforgettable experience less forgettable than other experiences shes already had thereby causing Carissa to leave him for Tonia who is the superior sadist 

 actually Keltham is not sure he really needs this part of the spec Carissas current attraction to him is not because Keltham is a supersadist and therefore it is Perfectly Pseudo Reasonable that you cant steal Carissa from him by being a better supersadist Alas that which is Perfectly Pseudo Reasonable is not always Perfectly Reasonable Anyways fix the current values at favorable ones to see if this function returns false even under quite favorable circumstances

Tonia can hurt Carissa slightly more than Keltham but not threateningly so she cant give Carissa an orgasm due to Carissas eroLARP character arc posing a sex problem so Tonias not threateningly better than him there And if Tonia was Keltham could always just tell Carissa shes not allowed okay something reacted to that inside him that didnt react to hearing about the magical item Belt of No Touch Possibly because in this case there was any reason for it and that made the scenario more real

Or say mostly in this scenario Carissa is being rented to Tonia in order to provide Tonia with not necessarily reciprocated pleasure just like if Tonia had bought a sex worker in dath ilan Suppose Carissa doesnt hate it Kelthams Carissamodel is now complaining that he is not supposed to check this and that offends her dignity of being harder to hurt than that well sorry Carissamodel that is not what Keltham is optimizing right now Carissa even manages to have a moderately fun time because Tonia hurts her some and reacts in a way that makes Carissa feel pride in her own sexual skills and it actually matters to her that Keltham told her to do it Postulating this part feels hard Keltham is not himself a Carissa and he is not sure what it is like on the inside to be a Carissa

Keltham thinks he is at least not obviously not okay with this whole sort of thing It feels a lot like asking in an ordinary relationship how you would feel about your partner going out for a night with somebody else whod been like yeah screw flirting whats your monetary price He wouldnt have objected to that back in dath ilan he wasnt that monogamous with anyone

 that these feel like similar questions probably reflects Keltham failing to get to grips with the actual gendertrope here Isidre seemed to think this should not feel like the same gendertrope as sex work even if it had similar gender ratios

For one thing Keltham was aromantic back in dath ilan because he is a romantically obligate sadist or at least the very first masochist he ran into was the first person he ever started feeling at all like he needed something from her that was about it being from her and didnt funge with things he could possibly get from somewhere else

How would Keltham feel about Carissa trading herself to somebody for one unskilled labor week is like 12gp or so Lets say 2gp Carissa is hot

Parts of Keltham are not happy with this Because Carissa is his Because Keltham is insecure about whether that would mean Carissa still liked him more than she likes anybody else Because Keltham is supposed to give permission first Keltham doesnt know

But if Keltham orders Carissa to do it For whatever reason

 then thats okay Possibly At least if all the other call values are set to Imaginary Tonia settings

And with likely settings on the Queen of Cheliax rather than favorable settings on Tonia If in exchange for an ultimately insignificant symbolic amount of money and with at least some pressure on the side to deny a trope and perhaps the entire theory of tropism Carissa is rented to Abrosomething Thrune Older than Carissa with the same de facto ability to chain her for real if she really wanted assuming that Keltham did not object which he would probably a much much more experienced sadist than Keltham with access to far more powerful sex toys that are the equivalent of overpowered vibrators with biofeedback functions and yes the ability to make Carissa come

 its not quite an obvious no It basically depends Keltham is pretty sure on whether Keltham is afraid that Carissa can be taken away from him by somebody being a better sadist to her than he can be for a while yet If somebody is the more skillful manipulator of masochism of what did Isidre call it submission can they steal away Carissas feelings from him The threat of giving Carissa an orgasm the threat of also having potential absolute power over her seem less real than that

Kelthams hindbrain which may of course be entirely factually wrong about everything intuits that it is basically not possible to steal Carissa by giving her a good enough orgasm Hurting her maybe understanding the deep keys to her sexuality that Keltham is still struggling with but not with humanly reasonable amounts of pleasure short of dangerous drugs

And as for the absolute power threat in part it doesnt feel as real because Keltham has not internalized a model of whatever it is that Carissa has inside her But also its impossible for two people to both have potential absolute power over someone If they came into conflict after all only one of them could get their way So long as that person would be Keltham rather than the Queen of Cheliax everything would be fine right It just has to be clear to Carissa that if Keltham and the Queen fought over her Keltham would be the one to end up with her if thats true the keys to her sexuality would be safe

 not that Keltham is thinking that he can like wield more political power inside Cheliax than its own Nearly Unilateral Chief Executive But the Queen of Cheliax has to be sensible and consider things like political capital with the Church of Asmodeus while Keltham can be much less sensible and walk out on Cheliax if the Queen steals his girl from him It shouldnt be about power alone Keltham doesnt think differential willingness to use power should be an acceptable coin to Carissas sexuality It controls who would actually end up with her if it came to that

Kelthams not willing not today to bargain a probabilistic or absolute walkout on Cheliax in order to tell the government of Cheliax to hand Carissa over to him in legal reality to say that he considers her a necessary part of his gains from trade

Telling Cheliax that he considers Carissa a necessary part of his gains from trade and hell walk out if the Queen steals her either by kidnapping her or by renting her from Keltham but then giving her an experience that shifts her romantic focus away from Keltham to the Queen Shes Kelthams the Queen cant have her except temporarily

Sure That he feels totally willing to do

Carissa would probably find that hot Kelthams Carissamodel confidently finds it very hot if Keltham actually wins at it but Keltham is not entirely confident in his Carissamodel

Well at least Keltham should definitely win He cant really see any functional Chief Executive being like lol no Im gonna take Carissa and watch you walk out on Cheliax and even if the Queen wanted to her advisors would stop her Shes an overly Good person in an overly Good government that has to be stopped by Asmodeus from resorting to outright mind control when it looks like that might be for the greater good of the country Keltham isnt pure Evil sure but hes not that Good which means he should win this particular contest

Of course thats only if people are running on sanity If the Queen is running on tropes shell try to steal Carissa no matter how bad it would be for Cheliax if she succeeded but then if those events are running on tropes its impossible to win Carissas true love sexuality without winning a fight for real power over her the Queen should ultimately fail to do that after making worrying progress and then end up kicked up out of Cheliax and or harem recruited

Anyways hes got enough of an answer that his next step is to ask Isidre to meet again and check his model of how all this works Or ask Carissa He kind of wants to ask Isidre first before he tries to talk with Carissa Isidre is more willing to be legible and nothing blows up if he says the wrong thing in front of her

Carissa has thought up a reasonable amount of opinions about contraception and magnetism despite being distracted every few seconds by contemplating the fact that Keltham is probably contemplating Isidres offer

The Queen 

 theres not actually much point contemplating what having sex with the Queen of Cheliax would be like and not just because that definitely counts as flirting with her It will probably be awful Carissa is a grown adult and is going to go to Hell someday and can handle awful Itll probably be so being hurt isnt upsetting being hurt can be fun and even when its more than she can take like the cursed bag its not upsetting its bad but its a specific kind of bad thats all right There are things that are actually upsetting and 

 thinking about them is just asking for it 

 no shell just think about how to orchestrate a convincing demonstration of Suggestion to Keltham instead

Pending questions resolved into a state of quiescence Keltham relaxes more into the massage Its nice Does he want to command some non reciprocated sexual service from Carissa at the end of this

The idea of ordering her to do it seems more comfortable now possibly it has something to do with having heard that she has any coherently imaginable endgame maybe its just a shock having had time to sink in and for Keltham to adjust

But then his libido might go offline for a while He shouldnt expend his newly refilled ero reservoir if he needs to have another conversation with Isidre today its not clear how urgent this whole thing is exactly

Carissa Keltham says out loud his voice coming out sounding as relaxed as he is Im too relaxed right now to really want to move so can I ask you to have them return my reply to Isidre that Im interested in further discussing her second suggested course of action though Im not yet on a definite yes And can I possibly get a yes no in the next ten minutes about whether or not Isidre wants to meet me again today

It wouldnt occur to Keltham that Isidre might not imagine him to be capable of a quick reconsideration and answer One hour is a long time to think in dath ilan and sure it may take longer to reconsider some major life questions but theres no presumption that you cant do it in an hour It similarly wouldnt occur to Keltham that he ought not ask a Senior Governance Official for a yes no answer in ten minutes somebody like Isidre is surely interrupted often enough and good enough at task switching that shes checking her tiny task queue every eight minutes in Isidres computer based and network connected task management system which will continue to go on existing in Kelthams imagination and his preprogrammed social reflexes unless and until he thinks explicitly about that question for literally half of a second

Ill ask but she might not be interruptible that soon says Carissa whod say that even if Isidre wasnt the Queen of Cheliax

Keltham has further thoughts on renting Carissa to the Queen of Cheliax Thats terrifying but definitely a success Carissa is going to let herself enjoy her success without dwelling too much on its implications for whether she gets tortured which is ultimately not the thing that matters here

How would Carissa know that if it was true But if its info Carissa shouldnt have from his perspective on the gaslighting hypotheses hes always considering in the back of his mind she wouldnt just blurt it out would she If they were that bad at LARPing theyd have screwed up by now surely

Of which it is said in dath ilan Being suspicious is easy being suspicious of the correct 1 out of the 1000 pieces of information you received today is hard

Make it so Keltham says And then continue the massage if youre still okay with rephrase continue the massage and tell me if youre running out of easy energy for it

So she steps outside flags down some staff and delivers Kelthams message for Isidre I told him that someone important probably couldnt get him an answer in the next ten minutes but if she happens to be free or reading my thought transcripts full time anyway hi Abrogail 

Abrogail does in fact have a country to run And either Otolmens suddenly really likes Cheliax or She really dislikes somebody else Abrogail had not in fact realized before now how incredibly important it is to not piss off Otolmens in any way However she does realize it now and Aspexia can stop repeating it at her

Carissa goes back in to give Keltham a massage Theyll knock if they get an answer

The massage continues to be nice

Keltham doesnt especially feel like massaging Carissa back apparently if he is honest with himself about that He would do it if they were trading pleasures obviously but he does not seem to really actually want to give massages

He still feels grateful for it and a need to do something nice for Carissa in return no matter how much she says he doesnt have to he wants to anyways

Keltham doesnt feel like massaging her back But he does feel like buying a massage for her as soon as hes got any gold pieces That seems like the blatantly obvious solution 

The thought of a stranger touching Carissas naked body does not feel especially pleasant

Keltham is not used to his brain working like this and its causing his self model to stumble over itself repeatedly

 he could pay one of the other girls to give Carissa a massage from him

For that matter if he doesnt have any gold yet he could tell Ione to do it after shes recovered

Is Keltham allowed to do that does it count as something Ione offered him

Well Keltham doesnt have any massive anti legibility issues with Ione so he can just ask which will make his life massively simpler Kelthams guess is that Iones objection if she has any will be that Carissa might ask what got traded to Ione for the massage and Ione doesnt want to mention the Nethys thing to Carissa But they could just tell Carissa its a secret so that doesnt seem like a problem

Seems like a plan

One of Ferrer Maillols last coherent recent thoughts as Contessa Lrilatha herself dragged him by the scruff of his neck into the temple torture chamber was that he has now realized what kind of project disaster surpasses starting a god war Its being told that one of your stupid oversights just managed to ruin a lot of hard work put in by Aspexia Rugatonn Contessa Lrilatha and Gorthoklek all of whom are now personally pissed at you and Gorthoklek will be visiting you during your stay

Ferrer Maillol is currently driven into a rather extreme mental state and begging Asmodeus to do something anything to deliver him

Asmodeus does that very very rarely as one might expect

As it happens though Ferrer Maillol is currently in a state unusually apt to receive messages from Asmodeus who has a message to deliver It conveniently concerns a matter on which Maillol has already been partially instructed

And Asmodeus does need to do this often enough if very very rarely that people ever hear about that time Asmodeus did it once That way theyll go on sincerely pleading to Him in the extremity of their torture which He enjoys

Besides its amusing Have a vision tiny squirrel Asmodeus in His finite mercy has given you a temporary reprieve from all the infinite torment that will someday be yours

Eight minutes later theres a knock on Kelthams door

Keltham is sufficiently relaxed that hell take a moment to see if Carissa does anything about this without him having to speak

Yep she can get the door She wasnt particularly expecting an answer that fast 

Ah says a young looking palace page boy who wouldnt be out of place in Taldor and would never actually be seen in Cheliax sounding audibly sort of stuttery with annoyingly long pauses between stutters ah um are you uh are you Sevar I have uh a message for ah uh Keltham

While he stutters rapid messages delivered by magic where Keltham cant hear

Queens transcript is ready for Sevar

Asmodeus has given them a directive to move Keltham to a new location one that will somehow be more protected from divine interference than even the palace as soon as Aspexia can get a new Forbiddance spell and put that up tomorrow at dawn Theyre not to spare any expense this time Cheliax is suddenly wealthier than expected for reasons to be described later

The anti interference divine protection should prevent any more oracles from being created even if someone on site isnt soul sold

Maillol is still recovering Sevars input is requested in Maillols place about the new project setup Possibly Kelthams input should be solicited too

What do they tell Keltham what message does the page have for Keltham Some lies seem required and Sevar is the only one who can authorize them

 okay Most urgent question is what to tell Keltham theyre setting up a new project site and want his input into anything itd be particularly useful for it to have If he asks for an explanation the damage to the villa was more extensive than expected Yes Kelthams here I can take a message or depart if its secret

I ah uh the page boy audibly pulls himself together Damage to the villa ah more extensive than expected he recites New project site uh being set up Moving tomorrow at dawn Does Keltham have uh input on anything particularly useful to have there

Whiteboards Keltham wants to yell immediately but that word does not actually exist in Taldane Besides he can use his own Prestidigitation now

Is there a meeting I should be at Keltham calls

Theyd obviously have to set up a fake meeting for him and echo information to and from the real meeting but resources are available to do that if Sevar thinks they should

Theyre just passing memos around since half the people involved in the decision process are also essential for the war effort He could meet with someone in Acquisitions if he wants though

Uh its mostly uh paper going back and forth because of uh the war and deciders being too busy but theres still uh I was told uh you can talk to Acquisitions if its not a paper thing

Keltham pulls himself up to a sitting position in bed thereby ending the massage this sufficiently increases the probability that he should meet with Isidre again before leaving the palace tomorrow that he should conserve his ero energy for having a callable libido while he does that Ive got additional questions but it doesnt sound like youve got additional answers like why this is a tomorrow at dawn thing is the palace considered not safe I will think about what we need and probably go talk to Acquisitions in the likely event that this isnt a piece of paper issue Who do I go to in Acquisitions if you were told that

The page names a random name which can readily be allocated to whoever plays that role

How when does Sevar want the Queens transcript of Keltham for her to review

Security has decided to do additional screening of project involved people for not being secret Kuthite agents Then Carissa can be absent for her further screening and can get the review of the transcript done as well as her punishment which she expects she should take at the palace because Abrogail might want to watch

Security policy would usually call for Sevar being escorted off as soon as she was told about the Security review should they lie about that part or should Sevar be immediately escorted out after this

They should not lie about that but they dont have to tell her now it might be convenient to tell her in ten minutes after shes gotten Kelthams reaction to the relocation

Affirm somebody will check back in on you in 10

Anything else

Thats uh it The stuttery page departs

Weird speech patterns huh You wouldnt think somebody like that would find their comparative advantage running messages Maybe he was scared for some reason well if its something bad theyre doing you wouldnt send somebody visibly scared of it so probably its just the whole godwar followed by mortalwar

 maybe thats just what talking sounds like at Intelligence 10 Keltham has never actually met anyone with Intelligence 10

Okay apparently weve suddenly got to figure out all of our project infrastructure wishlist Keltham says Better classroom setup breakout rooms larger white writing surfaces would be nice even if Prestidigitation library for reference books as we can get them material experimentation laboratory for melting metals biological laboratory where we keep the stocks of mice whatever you do for a magical laboratory regular so you want to be a wizard training setup for me am I missing anything

Do you want a cuddleroom separate from your bedroom Do you want a bedroom like this one Plumbing Hot water

 yes to all of those important things

There shall furthermore be if at all possible plumbing and hot water for my Carissa and predicting my future selfs desires for other people who might end up with a Keltham possessive adjective in front of their names

It counts as flirting by local rules if you let it be known the criteria was as such Nothing wrong with that just so you know Hmm Do you want the cuddleroom stocked like would be conventional or should it start out empty to avoid spoilers

Storage closet to which youve got the key you take things out of the closet as I figure them out

And you know considering the overall situation I am not really concerned about it being overly fast relationship escalation if everyone in my research harem gets the simultaneous information that I might be interested in dating some of them

Keltham feeling possessive of his presents from Cheliax is a good thing Should they bother stocking the library with the kinds of books we normally put in libraries or are those bad enough to be useless and youd rather start with empty shelves and fill them out with specific things we specifically want

Unsure Thinking Reference books those meant to teach subjects we should have no matter how terrible they are For the more relaxed section I think we at least start with some books that research haremettes enjoy reading or they state their personal favorites and those get added to the library for others to read maybe I dont think I need any extraneous terrible books thrown in on top of that Relaxed library section isnt as urgent as the reference section

Do we need to tell them like kitchens and dining rooms must exist somewhere Im assuming that sort of thing gets handled well without our input but I check that assumption

Obviously they have favorite books Only the Lost Dead have no favorite books

Theyll handle that I mentioned plumbing and hot water because that is not at all considered a thing you just have everywhere by default and probably restricts the number of places they can put us severely but most places have kitchens and dining rooms and you know servants and security and sunlight and so on

If you cant add plumbing to something that didnt previously have plumbing then how does anything ever end up with plumbing Also servant doesnt Baseline well

People with job responsibilities of keeping the place clean and cooking the food and running messages and going to the market for food I think mostly plumbing gets added to new buildings or when a building is majorly renovated in a way that involves knocking down most of the walls Maybe for something this important theyll get a high level cleric in to add plumbing with Stone Shape

If its a 4th circle cleric spell or lower then I will do it I do not want to fight the lingering Good parts of my brain every day about whether I should be lending other people my bathroom

Shes been taking down his requests on paper I will note that it is a major cost to you for anyone to not have plumbing even if none of us mind that much Its a third circle cleric spell but getting good results with it also takes practice though I guess maybe a kind of practice thats useful for you to get

I dont currently know about any 3rd circle spells worth a spellslot and have been spending them on Truthspells and Auguries and so on instead to save my god resources And yeah it is not implausible that I should get any practice with detailed magical work at all But not urgently so if somebody else can do that exact part great

Quarters for outside experts short term and longer term Somebody who knows how to take care of mice for example Or a place to put up somebody for three days while we talk to them about metallurgy

Meeting room suitable for the Chelish equivalent of Very Serious for if Isidre and five of her friends decide that they need to come in and talk to us Suite suitable for somebody like Isidre to stay in overnight if thats necessary The fact that were being moved out of the palace this fast is suggestive of them not wanting us here for any number of good or bad reasons meaning that theyd come to us instead of us going to them presumably or do we just get a meeting room with a big two way mirror that connects to the palace Hes got to remember that this is not actually a low tech world its a magitech world they may have videoconferencing

Guest room for visiting royalty meeting room for visiting royalty paired mirrors exist Ill note thats another option no idea which is cheaper in wartime 

I mean not royalty people who are important Like in Governance and so on Relatives of important people what why

Ah Keltham

 yep people who are important in general not just royalty but high enough quality they can host royalty

Keltham is confused about why relatives of important people require higher hosting requisites than important people themselves But he is not going to ask because it is probably not the most key question right now

After some further brainstorming which is not going that fast anymore and currently consists of Keltham sitting with his eyes closed trying to think of another thing Sevar gets inaudibly poked about whether shes ready for her Security review

Yep ready

Theres a knock upon the door This time theres three sober looking Securities outside it

A security review has been required for Carissa Sevar one of them says You have up to one minute to finish up any current tasks do not cast any new spells

Everyone on this project is being rescreened one of the other Securities says more politely to Keltham Except for you I suppose Protocol says that as soon as Sevar knows thats going to happen she needs to come with us immediately and not cast any more spells along the way

Separately Sevar its been pointed out that this project needs a new codename we cant keep calling it this project in front of him he may eventually ask us what were calling it Itd be good practice to have something internally that we can also use in front of Keltham reduces the prospect of him somehow overhearing the real name

The current actual codename is Project Pet Outsider with the form of pet implying that somebody such as Asmodeus owns that pet

Part of him wants to object that obviously Carissa is not the traitor but that is not how real life works and also it is not how tropes work

Understood Keltham says wondering why part of his brain just went all queasy well no its pretty obvious its because thats Carissa theyre security reviewing

But this too is not an objection that grownups make and Keltham does not make it

Carissa do you just give the list to Security to run to Acquisitions do I take it down to Acquisitions

The project can be Project Keltham or Project Lawful or Project dath ilan she doesnt know how Kelthams translation even handles pet Tasks finished she says to Security They can probably take it down to Acquisitions for you I should see you in a couple hours Snort You know unless Im secretly a Kuthite traitor

Not actually funny

Keltham doesnt say it

He really hopes his life doesnt run on tropes

Two of the Securities peel off as soon as theyre out of sight of Kelthams door and get on with their real jobs The remaining one escorts Carissa to a room where she can review her notes and hands her a sealed packet that contain the Queens slightly censored transcript of Kelthams thoughts

The Security also recounts recent events at somewhat greater length

Rather a lot of diamonds suddenly materialized around Otolmenss oracle

Theres an obvious thought about where those diamonds might have come from and their best hopes there seem to be actually coming true Nidal shifted to a more tightly defensive conservative and dare one hope worried posture afterwards Its not the same kind of game over as if Zon Kuthon had been destroyed and his clerics depowered but the remaining timeline is looking like months not years

Nobody has any good idea of how Nidal managed to piss off Otolmens this much except obviously that it had something to do with Nidals intentions for Keltham It nonetheless implies that people should tread even more carefully which shouldnt in fact be possible in the first place when you are dealing with an Otolmens event but nonetheless do consider this is what happens when Otolmens gets pissed If anybody manages to piss Otolmens off at Cheliax instead then perhaps all the diamonds in Cheliax will be teleported to Lastwall It is the considered belief of Grand High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonn that this would be a bad idea and people should not do it Or come close to doing it Or think too much about doing it Or do anything that is not technically doing it Or do something that really shouldnt piss Otolmens off that much if Otolmens is being reasonable Just dont fucking mess with Otolmens If anybody thinks that Rugatonn is trying to tell them anything especially complicated here they should come to Rugatonn for clarification about how she is really in fact saying something very simple Or they can just kill themselves directly Rugatonn is happy with either outcome

Maillol who received Asmodeuss vision while being personally tortured by Gorthoklek briefly and barely pulled himself together to communicate the bones of their Lords vision Asmodeus communicated a complex attitude about Otolmenss sudden gift which suggests that Otolmens has well overpaid for the new project to have adequate security precautions and while they shouldnt even remotely try to spend as much as Otolmens actually paid theyre not supposed to just take the money and run either

The new project location will have actual fucking security this time and any complaints about the budget should be considered in the light of Otolmenss apparent concern and corresponding generosity

Asmodeuss sent vision requires very strongly that Keltham needs to be not too far from Ostenso Asmodeuss vision implies that Keltham should be within the designated region the moment its safe so as soon as a new Forbiddance can be put up somewhere Nidal hopefully wont know about hence shortly after dawn tomorrow when Rugatonn can request a Forbiddance spell

Theyre currently thinking of renovating an old coastal fortress

Wow 

Carissas preferred thing to tell Keltham about this is the truth that Cheliax is acting on orders from Otolmens she thinks that Keltham is more likely to break rules in a way that offends Otolmens accidentally than he is to do so deliberately and if he were doing it deliberately hed likely at least take cautionary measures like running it by Carissa first or maybe talking to Broom Otolmens intervention seems like the sort of thing that might be clearer from Kelthams perspective than theirs and which is therefore going to end up being even harder to hide She assumes Aspexia Rugatonn will veto this so she wants to give a story that isnt incompatible with telling him that later which probably means just telling him that the relocation is for Security reasons they cant disclose at this time 

Carissa would appreciate a further briefing on known things about Otolmens at some point

Coastal fortress seems fine Keltham seems plenty attached to luxury even knowing how desperately poor everyone in the world is she isnt sure if itll actually hit him for Evil if they fund his luxuries with brutal taxation of some distant village but it seems worth exploring Plumbing is a must 

She assumes from the fact the packet is sealed that she is intended to read it alone

On usual policy they could in principle tell Keltham that theyre doing it on orders from Brooms god so long as they dont tell him that Brooms god is specifically about world destroying or multiverse destroying threats and allow him to go on thinking that Shes mostly about preventing giant flaming Wish craters Rugatonn would have to review the disclosure that this move was on Brooms gods request but she wouldnt necessarily say no

Security also notes that Cheliax of course acts on only Asmodeuss orders even if Asmodeus perhaps bargains with other gods as part of His business even Otolmens surely would not dare to instruct Him so or give Him orders to pass along and the generosity of Her payment suggests that She bargained with Asmodeus from a position of weakness To suggest that Cheliax is in any way acting on Otolmenss orders would be a lie which Sevar is welcome to authorize explicitly Weirdly Security does not hurt her about this

Her assumption is correct Security will depart as soon as Sevar wants to read the transcript

Hmm With approval from the Grand High Priestess she wants them to tell Keltham that their present understanding is that Brooms god of messes requested the move and heightened security generally and that Asmodeus instructed it and maybe even that the instruction was specifically to go somewhere near Ostenso The most obviously useful thing here is Keltham being reluctant to leave the area though mostly Carissas operating on the assumption that this has weird correlates she cant see

And shell take a look at the transcript now She does not ask if that means her mind wont be read while she reads it it might instead just mean her mind is being read directly by Abrogail or something and anyway my mind isnt presently being read is a bad starting point for thought

Abrogails transcript contains a censored section right at the most exciting part about the Second Law with notes saying that Keltham thought things about other peoples knowledge of these truths driving them insane and possibly collapsing the universe that most of his thoughts were incomprehensible ideas with no remote conceptual neighbors in any language that Abrogail knows and that the parts that did make it through were incredibly fucking disturbing Abrogail is obviously saying this because she knows how terribly curious it will make Sevar about the one part she most wanted to know but it is also true and Rugatonn requires further thought on whether Sevar gets to see this

Abrogail has included a more detailed explanation of why Sevar is being tortured with particular torture codes from her sheet being noted at particular points that all sum up exactly to the total amount of torture she received in her original note

The most severe torture code is annotated on the section where Keltham thought about his secret plan to establish a fully legible meta level signal via the no verbal objections order This looks like a huge setback for their corruption plans If Sevar noticed this at all which was her job then she didnt think about it in words and it didnt show up in her thought transcript meaning Abrogail got blindsided here Abrogail isnt sure how to recover Sevar didnt say anything to the effect of how most masochists wouldnt go along with it even if Sevar herself is fine or how she could do it for a month no problem but after any longer of not being allowed to scream and beg she would probably start to feel sad Maybe when Keltham gets to the appropriate point Sevar can confess that shes starting to feel sad Keltham is unfortunately explicitly suspicious that Cheliax is trying to lure him into rape But even if Sevars opinion is that any objection to Kelthams plan would have made him too suspicious Sevar didnt apparently notice and definitely didnt report it explicitly Bad Sevar go to your torture room

The second worst torture code is for Sevar thinking about how the Queen of Cheliax was being stupid for saying a worse version than the one Sevar suggested When in fact the Queen of Cheliax has higher Perception than Sevar can fucking dream of and it was warning her off Sevars version verbatim possibly because Keltham wouldve been able to identify it as coming from Sevar Sevars failure to imagine that the Queen of Cheliax could have any good reason for presuming to not do exactly what Sevar said reveals an actual problem of subordination here and thats why this punishment is severe Thinking about lighting Abrogail on fire despite knowing you might get punished for thinking that was not the problem thats just flirting and will be dealt with separately

The third severest torture code also appearing in the original sum of codes Carissa was given is the fee for making the fucking Queen of Cheliax spell all this out for Sevar in the annotations because Sevar apparently cannot imagine her Queen ever being professional about anything

 okay you know what thats actually completely reasonable And its true that Carissa has been having a hard time imagining her Queen being professional about anything though in her defense thats because 

 well the thing Keltham said about how a pragmatic person in the Queens position would simply have sex with someone other than Carissa

But The Queen is who she is and wants what she wants and is clearly quite good at her job while wanting some things that offer constraints on how she does her job and Carissa was in fact underrating that internally assuming the Queen was less capable than she was and the punishment is warranted and she should have assumed the punishment would be warranted Shell get it done before she leaves for a coastal fortress in Ostenso

Shes extremely annoyed about the part she really wants being censored but she thinks nonetheless she understands the Second Law stuff well enough to be working around now and well enough to be considering some strategies like saying dramatically ironic things that have no payoff at all because reality doesnt actually pay attention to dramatic irony Keltham made a face when she asserted she wasnt a Kuthite spy

She has several ideas for working around the no order thing though she didnt see what Keltham was playing at until the transcript and isnt delighted by it Firstly shes not actually sure that it wouldnt ding a person for Evil if they are in the habit of ordering their slaves not to refuse them and vaguely intend that if ever disobeyed about that theyd stop the game and let the slave go In Carissas particular case its going to be more complicated but as a general order Kelthams in the habit of giving it seems in some ways advantageous maybe they can arrange for him to give that order to someone else who 1 will understand Kelthams intent as the obvious you are not entitled to refuse me so dont 2 has adequate self control and wont in fact trigger it and 3 this one might be inconvenient will react with arousal to treatment they desperately wish they werent subject to And then make it gradually clearer to Keltham over time that the reason hes being obeyed is because hes entitled to obedience not because its sexy per se Secondly Carissas planning to eventually raise with Keltham that always following orders is in fact less sexy than sometimes breaking orders and being suitably punished for that so hopefully he can just not update the orders about no as they gradually transition to a model where he doesnt have her obedience so much as the right and means to compel it 

Can someone alert Carissa please when Maillols competent to take over project duties and in the mean time hand her any project related work thats been sitting so she can hand it off to him in relatively good shape while she goes for her punishment

Shes not scared even though shes definitely never had half an hour before and knows this kind of thing is not linear in effects That would be pathetic and shes not that pathetic

Project stuff Theyre only giving her the things that other stuff is urgently waiting on but thats still some work and shes not going to be as fast at it as Maillol

Kelthams requests to Requisitions are all things that would be routed to Sevar anyways because Keltham requested them and who knows what hes thinking or how hell react if anyone says no to anything The requests now have budget line items attached to them but are otherwise the same as they submitted basically Sevar needs to decide whether to sign off on each of them

If she signs off on absolutely everything including the 2 way mirrors the total cost will be somewhere around the vicinity of a 6 intelligence headband

Shes going to reject the mirrors for now both because theyre a big chunk of the budget and because the mirrors are a sense in which Keltham would be less contained and she gets the sense that what Otolmens wants is Keltham maximally contained She approves most of the other things She is definitely not experienced at this but still within an hour she can hand things off to Maillol in reasonably decent shape if hes ready for a handoff is he

Yeah he isnt really But Sevar got everything that was blocking further progress

Right but they shouldnt both of them be incapacitated at the same time probably so shell take her punishment later Whats the less pressing stuff 

Note to self which she doesnt really think she needs avoid angering Gorthoklek

Okay heres some less pressing stuff

Also this just in Paracountess Isidre Thrune cordially requests your covert attendance upon her meeting with Keltham in fifteen minutes

Its not clear whether Security knows who Isidre Thrune is He presumably knows theres no such Paracountess

Shed be honored Someonell need to hit her with Foxs Cunning repeatedly and maybe also Owls Wisdom there are disadvantages to having your cleverness run out too far ahead of your sense

Theyll do their best on fifteen minutes notice but of course a lot fewer wizards prepare Owls Wisdom than Foxs Cunning

Abrogail has a slightly nervous feeling at this point She has gotten the verbal transcript about Keltham suspecting her or rather Isidre of Detect Desires She is starting to understand why Sevar is so nervous about lying to Keltham maybe she should have gotten it from transcripts but living it is different Most people if you tell them something that theyre supposed to believe will act around you like they believe that one thing Keltham builds a world in his mind where those things would have actually been true And just completely lives there He lives in that world at you

And then youre stuck in whatever world Keltham has decided you put him in

Yes shes still too busy for this but Keltham is leaving the palace tomorrow morning and even Abrogail does not wantonly waste her Teleports she has a lot of places to be simultaneously

Paracountess Isidre Thrune overly Good person with an overly large intelligence headband who definitely has a whole lot of magically enhanced perception but is probably not actually using Detect Desires on people rises to greet Keltham as he enters an even nicer meeting room

Having a Paracountess of Cheliax rise to greet him as he enters is going to be a courtesy that is like completely lost on Keltham His thoughts show only a brief puzzlement about why Isidre would do that

Keltham quickly seats himself his thoughts showing an intention not to waste Isidres valuable time he requested this meeting and Isidre may not have her schedule cleared for it

Ive probed my newfound sexuality some and arrived at some answers Keltham says So first Im pretty sure that I do not currently want for my own sake to demand that Cheliax hand over Carissa to me and I can appreciate that it would be missing the point to do it for hers Maybe Ill find the gendertrope inside me the sexual behavior pattern and way of thinking thats the complement of hers where I actually want absolute power over Carissa enough that I want to go do that for myself But its not there or not awake yet and Im not doing that until it is

 Baseline gendertrope does not contain the syllable for the Baseline trope the sounds of the words are distinct

Awww too bad but not a definite no and not offense that it was suggested 

Understandable and I believe very much correct under present conditions Isidre says I wont say that the government of Cheliax stands ready to assist you in the future but I do thus stand ready

Shes taken the time to set up more two way communication this time now that Sevar hopefully has any grasp of how to act slightly more professional around her And now that Abrogail is not springing an elaborate surprise on Sevar

Pass to Sevar

Kelthams thoughts are glossing over earlier thoughts about how he can use Detect Desires with your consent on general rather than that specific use to verify that you still want him even if youre in his absolute power His thought on a possibly acceptable relationship is that for so long as you still want him youll have no choice but to have him He doesnt seem to be thinking particularly on the morality of it no hes thinking that hes not sure what his Civilization would think of that but would be delighted to watch them get into an enormous fight over it

 well that seems like progress Yes that definitely seems like progress though actually she doesnt know how Pharasma would judge it either 

Its much easier to be professional when one isnt having an elaborate surprise sprung on them indeed some would conceptualize professionalism as involving minimal elaborate surprises sprung on their co conspirators Carissa herself who is young and naive and knows little compared to her vastly wiser superiors in the palace has no opinions on the question

My sexuality does not seem basically opposed to renting Carissa out to a woman I know given sufficiently favorable conditions It is not happy with strangers I havent asked my sexuality about men because I dont currently really know any Chelish men standard Civilization gendertropes suggest higher resistance but I havent been able to ask myself

I think the three main conditions here are one getting to know the Queen of Cheliax like at all two figuring out whether Carissa is all right with this in a way that doesnt just trigger hey you can run a sword through me and this isnt even a sword so Ill be fine and three is uh complicated Any thoughts about one or two before we tackle that I dont get the impression that I can just ask Carissa if shes fine with being rented or can I

Kelthams thought processes are wordlessly trying and wordlessly rejecting sort of pre thoughts about ways he could put his unspoken third want into words its not easy to read

Isidre will temporize by discussing want one while Abrogail waits to see if Sevar has advice on want two

The Queen is obviously another very busy person but considering your potential importance to Cheliax it is plausible the two of you should meet in any case and you may as well do that before you depart the palace I can try to arrange a meeting tonight

Though it would be nice to know before that that matters had been arranged to avoid any explosive runes going off in our faces as a result of unrolling that scroll

Mostly a want number three issue I suspect but I also cannot make any representations to the Queen until I understand the effects on Carissa and how and if Carissa ends up being okay with that and how I end up knowing that

Carissa thinks Keltham could reasonably ask her in what condition she expects to return if rented out or if subjected to any number of other things but should probably not be encouraged to just directly talk to her about everything because then their relationship will be too healthy and functional She feels a pang about this which she ignores

You could simply ask me about the effects of different scenarios says Isidre and I could give you an answer which would be quite good and reliable based on having sufficient familiarity with Sevars kind of submissive I suspect youre not going to accept that so you can also ask Sevar in what condition she expects to return if rented out Or what happens to her if you subject her to any number of other conditions if you dont want to highlight that one as one that shell notice especially That if not some other things I think you could ask her plainly

I apologize for not being able to simply join states of belief with you but yes the problem is that I dont just need an answer thats actually good I need an answer I know is good Two isomorphic problems from my perspective but very different problems from yours

I think Carissa has some equivalent of what a dath ilani would call dignity which translates via Share Language to Taldane dignity but I suspect is really not the same thing at all Carissas dignity is that she is impossible to truly hurt even by running a sword through her and then refusing to Raise her which is what makes it safe for the man to whom shes completely given herself to do anything he wants with her and not be afraid

And if we were all in dath ilan she could tell me that was true and I would maybe check in with a Keeper first to see if they thought Carissa was in generally good epistemic health belief health but then the fact that Carissa thought that was true about herself would be very reliable evidence because dath ilani know how to see within themselves if that sort of thing is actually true

The fact that I got trained in that explicitly and warned about a lot of pitfalls suggests that if that training actually did anything Chelish people should actually be much worse at distinguishing what should be true about themselves what they want to be true about themselves from what actually is true about themselves

Im worried that Carissa is just answering me from within her model of what Carissa should be and that model is not rigorously separated and distinguished from what Carissa is Which seems like the really obvious mistake that say I would make if you took all the dath ilani training out of somebody otherwise with my exact heritage

If I try to discuss this with my Carissamodel my Carissamodel says back that Chelish dignity also says that its her place to safeguard her own safety and not rely on anybody else to protect her when shes giving herself away that it would be undignified for her to be relying on me to think about her safety I dont then feel happy and reassured when my Carissamodel says this back to me and I dont know where to go from there

An observation that might be useful to Keltham is that by the standards of dath ilan its plausible that almost no one is competent to know what they actually want and what they can withstand and yet they do still have to make decisions and do things and it can simultaneously be true that they might be wrong and that it is impossible to do better than treating them as if theyre right until one encounters actual reason to think theyre specifically wrong about something specific trust withheld in full generality can be damaging 

Another might be that one commonly solves this by hurting their Carissa to her breaking point such that they subsequently know what it is and Keltham probably literally isnt capable of that yet but the fact hes not also means this isnt very urgent

Ive sometimes made mistakes of that kind myself Isidre says By the standards of dath ilan then Im a child and except for you theres nobody in Golarion who can raise me to adulthood or teach me how to protect myself I nonetheless think Id be upset if you told me that I wasnt allowed to have the sort of sex I find satisfying because I was not by dath ilani standards competent to decide that I wanted it I think Id actually be offended even if you told me merely that you needed to check over my thinking and sign off on it first

And theres I feel like theres some even more precise way that a dath ilani would say that thing I just said going on your class transcripts Something more Lawful to say about what people have to do when theyre not competent and how they might be wrong but if you dont specifically know that theyre wrong and never trust them anyways I havent actually attended your classes and I cant put it into words

Oof yeah thats valid Let me think about that

Though its a little too persuasive maybe like this is what happens when somebody with an Intelligence Wisdom headband even if thats not really thinkoomph just three components of thinkoomph tries to bend their will on persuading you and presenting only one side instead of calmly listing out all the arguments and counterarguments to be summed

Shes supposed to what Who does that What the Abyss is Abrogail supposed to do about that Of course Isidre is trying to persuade him she didnt come to this meeting without having any goals

Abrogail transmits Kelthams most recent thoughts to Sevar with a note that Abrogail doesnt think she can quickly grasp or adopt the dath ilani behavior that Keltham is thinking of and can only try to sound more Why of course I am totally telling you about all the downsides of this contract look at these three right here which she was already trying to do in places

Ah Keltham Carissa thinks her preferred phrasing mightve been better in that regard but yields to Abrogails superior Splendour Its like its like if the thing youre trying to do is figure out who to send on patrol and if someone brings up that those two just had a bad breakup and wont get along your job isnt convincing them theyre wrong its figuring out what the best patrol group is with the new inputs Act like the decision power is already yours and you dont need to convince anyone and then like you need the patrol to nonetheless perform well against demons

One objection to what Abrogail just said is that it proves too much Keltham shouldnt buy and abuse literal children yes he should but theyre not going to get him there yet So it might be worth acknowledging his concerns as perhaps outweighing her clever response in some cases but pointing out that Carissa was judged competent by her society to swear the Worldwound oath which is as competent as her society is capable of acknowledging her to be and so even if one doesnt want to declare everyone competent until proven otherwise they could extend it at least to those whove served at the Lawfullest place in Golarion 

Modulo carefulness to not come across as too good at reading Keltham but Abrogail knows that

Keltham is now thinking that Isidre basically seems to be presenting a story about a search algorithm that quickly reaches quiescence and then youve got to choose the option with highest expectation of utility which yes Keltham supposes thats terribly mysterious if all the Law is unknown to you But isnt it obvious that Keltham wouldnt be here if his meta level prediction process hadnt suggested that there was further value of information in trying to figure out the likely consequences to Sevar better than he can get by just asking Sevar And Isidre hasnt even given him reason to believe that Sevar would be mostly probably right just sort of presented a social story about why you have to act like you believe somebodys words independently of whether theyre true And sure theres situations where the incentives and payoff matrices are structured such that Governance should just take people at their word independently of what the prediction market says about the probability its true but like at least ask

Well actually he can just ask Youve said basically that I should act like I believe Sevar regardless of the probability that shes right but if shes only 10 likely to be right thats probably a bad idea

Abrogail supposes thats what she gets for prompting him into thinking about the Law behind anything

I dont suppose it would help if I pointed out that Sevar was trusted by us to take the Worldwound oath which is as mentally competent as Cheliax can possibly acknowledge anyone to be That she served and served well in the Lawfullest place in all Golarion

Id worry that the Lawfullest place in Golarion isnt very much more Lawful than the coldest place in the Suns core is cold Your concept of an oath is something that gets your soul destroyed by Abaddon if you break it and you do it that way instead of the way that gods do it because nobody here has enough Law in them to swear what dath ilan would regard as a real oath

Though maybe if Id been to the Worldwound for longer than a few minutes to talk to people knowing the language Id have a different impression I suppose I did meet Carissa Sevar there which is something of an update about the general Lawfulness level though I got the impression from you that even for the Worldwound she was special

Keltham is now starting to worry that hes talking himself into a corner where hell convince himself that he cant be sadistic to anybody because maybe all the masochists are just making a massive mistake about whether theyre masochists Keltham is aware that this thought is stupid but he doesnt know how to prove its stupid and then generalize the same proof to shoot down his Isidre reactive arguments for never being able to trust Carissa

Abrogail will transmit all that to Sevar

She is But Keltham I think you are maybe disrespecting Golarion a little too much We arent quite as bad as a dath ilani child of the age to have as little training in Law as we do Your concept of how much competence corresponds to how much grasp of Law is not correct for this place

Look I get that Im talking myself into a corner I just dont know how to talk myself out of it

He certainly is helpful in some incredibly bizarre way to anyone who might possibly be trying to corrupt him and manipulate him to their own ends Almost like nobody like her exists in his world

Abrogail wishes she was more confident that this means she could take over the place in a week with the poor naive dears offering her no resistance and not that everyone like her was successfully hunted and slaughtered and the memories of them erased from history except for Keepers who still remember very well how to do it

If he feels really strongly about this he could pay the Grand High Priestess to evaluate Carissas competence probably thats a bad idea for many reasons but among them that Carissa doesnt actually know what the Grand High Priestess would truthfully say 

What is the meaning of an oath is a hard question for us to answer with our vocabulary but it doesnt mean that oaths only mean to us their most obvious physical consequence and many people who one way or another dont fear Abaddon still give their word and mean it groping for a different basis for it to signify what it does

Theres really something to be said for doing things and checking whether they have good or bad consequences assuming the consequences are recoverable 

Also he could just directly bring this to Carissa shell in fact probably be upset and definitely at least somewhat turned off but thats only a consideration against it not absolute reason if hes too stuck

Isidre speaks quietly which is also its own Splendour Its not that our oaths mean nothing to us except the threat of Abaddon Keltham we do understand why they are things that Lawful people swear By dath ilani standards none of us understand properly because we cannot give the lectures you give and play the games you play but we do feel what an oath means even if we cannot say it

Sorry

I dont suppose that it would help if I observed that one very normal way of solving this problem would be for you to hurt Carissa to her actual breaking point so that you would subsequently know where that is And that you are completely incapable of this right now And that this indicates that you dont have an urgent problem here

Youve never tried to hurt her in any serious way How do you know shes this easy to break I guess I am in some sense offended on behalf of Carissas Chelish dignity she uses the Baseline loanword that Keltham used before I dont suppose though that appealing to her dignity is much of an argument to you either Is there anything a Lawful dath ilani would say about just trying to do a thing to see what happens when it wont be a disaster for it to fail

Weve pretty much got a proverb in nearly those exact words yeah He utters it in Baseline an eight syllable couplet which rhymes and scans because Baseline was designed in part to make that proverb be a rhyming couplet

To Sevar

Sevar watch yourself Its lovely that youre mastering the Law but Isidre isnt supposed to be its master

And Im sorry if Im wasting your time by being obstinate to a point I shouldve gotten But hurting Carissa to her breaking point sounds like it just is the failure and the disaster

Thats because you dont understand the meaning of anything youre doing More passion in Isidres voice now and a hint of Isidres real power in her voice Isidres that is not Abrogails Someone like Carissa desires to be hurt to her breaking point so that she can be broken and reforged and made what you want her to be heated in fire and tempered beaten and sharpened Youre not ready to do any of that you dont know how to bring her to that point and you dont know what to do with her once shes there but have the courtesy to her to not pretend that you tickling her too hard or whatever it is you do with her in bed now is going to shatter her beyond repair

Im Im sorry Keltham Bad memories I shouldnt have said that to you you werent the one I was really talking to

Hes a little confused by the concept of a Very Serious Person who like cant figure that out before she starts talking And then she wonders why hes worried that Carissas self reporting is going to be bad Its because you all have a nine year olds skill at self reporting at best and that seems like not enough for like hey how are you currently doing at being broken and remade oh wait cant ask you that its all supposed to be illegible cool

 his mind is evading by generating unspoken snark because he doesnt want to come to grips with Isidres actual point that is being made with real force and emotion behind it

And hey Keltham knows that But if he didnt hed be all like Oh I am currently thinking about this scorching burn against your argument and his self reports would all be useless

 actually did Isidre fake that slip so shed have a chance to let the more emotional words through That would be like discussion over in dath ilan if you got caught doing it but maybe its not metaphorically illegal in Golarion well either people with intelligence headbands still slip like that or she doesnt know Keltham knows that somebody with high Intelligence shouldnt do that Well somebody with high thinkoomph shouldnt do that her actual thinkoomph is not whatever Detect Intelligence says and they dont know the difference they presumably think that high Intelligence is as smart as the very smart people get Okay maybe the slip was real

Also hes not here to arrest Isidre metaphorically or otherwise hes here to consider if shes got a point

 what Whats thats different from better than Intelligence

Abrogail transmits this all to Sevar along with a note that Abrogail isnt going to try being emotional at Keltham again unless so advised

If Sever has professionally insubordinate thoughts about Abrogails mistake she can be tortured in the temple if she has flirtatiously insubordinate thoughts it can go to the personal queue

Sevar is a reasonably quick learner and the thing she has learned is to not try having opinions about Abrogails decisions which for all she knows may have been the best available at the time 

Shes better at self deception than most people its pretty obvious by now her self deceptions go deeper grow more roots She didnt just learn to quash the thought Abrogail makes mistakes she uprooted everything nearby replaced with you are too ignorant of the constraints on Abrogail to ever evaluate anything she does as a mistake

Carissa has only tried being emotional at Keltham once and what happened was that he decided he needed to invent contraception about her sadness it was very confusing Isidre should be glad hes not handling Isidres emotions like that Maybe dath ilan encourages that because they dont want their people emotionally manipulable and also dont want them to learn to simply not care about other people

Does anything bad happen if I talk about all this sort of thing with Carissa directly

Passing it to you Sevar this is controlling your side of this game

Isidre looks thoughtful and eats one of the small delightful snacks present by way of consideration

Its not generally advised to tell your submissives that youre having trouble regarding them as adults enough to make decisions but the likely consequence is shell think a little worse of you not shell walk out 

Also if Keltham is feeling meaningfully constrained by fear Carissa will walk out well thats precisely why some people like to put that decision too in his hands so that he can use reasoning processes that arent meant for situations where the other person might get fed up and walk away Uh that came out too influenced by dath ilan translate before you say it

Its not generally advised to tell a submissive like Sevar that youre having trouble regarding her as enough of an adult to make decisions but I expect the consequence is that shell probably be upset and definitely turned off and in the worst case she will think a little worse of you

I dont think shell walk out If youre afraid of that possibility I would point out that she would very much like to have that option be removed from herself and never again have to fear that youll be afraid of her walking out and not say things to her She wants you to be able to think about her the way youd think if you werent ever afraid shed leave you

I will admit a lot of times my reaction to what youre saying is that it has like one benefit but one would sort of expect a whole lot of other problems that came packaged with that one benefit

I meta vote to suspend this discussion branch and move back up the discussion tree I have a sense that this line of questioning is not likely to resolve much further with small amounts of further discussion My general takeaway is that you dont think it would be catastrophic for me to ask Carissa some hopefully careful questions so I will probably do that and get back to you on whether Im still requesting a Queen meeting Assuming point three which is uh kind of complicated resolves well Or at all

Kelthams thoughts show that hes politely waiting for Isidre to indicate whether shes okay with tabling this topic here

That is probably wise So your point one is that you need to meet the Queen Your point two is that you need not only for Carissa to be okay which she almost certainly will be but you need to know that somehow despite knowing so little and you think that the thing for you to do is to talk to Carissa about it Your point three is 

Feeling safe myself about renting Carissa to the Queen

Safe in what sense ah Youre worried that the Queen is better at looking like she has absolute power and that Carissa will start to like her more than she likes you

But you see Keltham the Queen would turn me into a statue forever if it happened to be convenient Asmodeus would too not that shes sure shes supposed to admit that to herself And I am weak and human and bask in the gentleness of someone whod have to be incredibly sorely provoked to destroy me eternally

Abrogail would not in fact do that to Sevar unless incredibly sorely provoked Abrogail does not say to Sevar at this time both for personal reasons of future plans and also because Abrogail has already fucking said so and Sevar didnt listen because she was too caught up in her fear fantasy

So as near as I can tell the three obvious pathways by which Carissa could end up being taken from me are one that the Queen is going to be a vastly better sadist two that Carissa has a sex problem which Im not going to go into if its not already in her file but the Queen is going to have vastly more expensive sex toys three that the Queen is the other person who could plausibly have absolute power over Carissa

My Carissamodel says that it is basically not possible to steal Carissa from me by pathway two that theres no realistic amount of pleasure you can get from sex toys and without dangerous drugs that you can use to steal a Carissa from a Keltham I nonetheless check explicitly that you agree with my Carissamodel there

Being much better at hurting her than I am and maybe looking like the Queen has more real power over her than I do both seem like actual problems

These problems could plausibly be solved by mature reasonable adults with five minutes of negotations They are much bigger problems if what were fighting is a trope that requires the Queen to try to steal Carissa from me no matter how little sense that makes and make concerning progress on it before the Queen gets revealed as a traitor or the matter gets resolved with an amicable harem expansion

Wait

If the fundamental reason why Carissa prefers Keltham is that Keltham will never statue her and then Abrogail kidnaps Carissa for purposes of slow yet ultimately fake petrification and afterward swears never to do that to her barring deliberate betrayal etc 

 could Sevar actually start falling in love with the Queen and start to lose attraction for Keltham Is that actually a thing they need to worry about here

 is the part where Abrogail then ends up losing her throne or pregnant with Kelthams child also something she needs to worry about in that case

This thought hasnt occurred to Carissa who is missing some important information on Abrogails future plans and shes mostly thinking about how Kelthams very cute and she should go into her punishment tonight aiming to work out that flaw even though it wasnt prominent among the ones listed 

Sevar hes talking about tropes again stop admiring how fucking pathetic you are and help me out here

Isidre picks up another snack and consumes it looking thoughtful and maybe a bit confused and worried I do agree that pleasuring Sevar is a most unlikely way for someone like the Queen to successfully steal someone like Sevar from someone like you she says truthfully Anyone you can do that to is not strong enough to be worth doing it to

Shes not admiring how pathetic she is shes developing a plan of attack to get it solved tonight

That hypothesis makes this more valuable to you as a test of his tropes theory though you understand why he wouldnt see it that way You have lots of observations about how incredibly implausible itd be for the Queen to steal Carissa but you arent sure how they hold up in tropeworld In the actual logical world though incredibly unlikely 

Also though he has good reason to put this line of thought on hold the Queen would absolutely respect a preexisting arrangement even if things are running on tropes she couldnt be the Queen of Cheliax if she broke a preexisting agreement between Keltham and Cheliax over Carissa such as that she is his

Eight hurrahs then for predictive modeling which has that form of pseudo success which is advance prediction of someone elses more expert prediction Keltham says unfortunately in Taldane where it sounds less than entirely snappy

Abrogail is no longer entirely sure shes safe to say that its incredibly implausible because Abrogail is no longer quite certain its true Keltham is right in a way theres a sense in which Abrogail can give Sevar more powerful experiences right now than Keltham can give her Abrogail was planning the most powerful experience that would still let Sevar recover to health afterwards well into the break and remake zone of torture Things like that have been known to ever affect a submissives feelings

But if thats all a trope is she able to just 

Suppose that tropes do have power here and we try to just not test it at all walk away Isidre says cautiously Does the trope fight back punish us for trying to defy it I realize youre going to say no but Im wondering what the answer is instead

We dont get to decide that there isnt going to be this huge complication Only the Queen can decide not to pursue Sevar And if a trope is manifesting in her then thats not something she will decide to do Its not that she cant decide it but that she wont

Its not that she cant but that she wont is unfortunately exactly the wrong literal phrasing to use if you were hoping to not remind Abrogail Thrune that she is now the Queen of Cheliax her mother is safely dead the tutoress who said those things to her and backed them up with a whip was turned into a statue eventually and that the point of being Abrogail Thrune is that literally nobody gets to tell you what to do She has a junior partnership with her senior partner Asmodeus and keeps to her side of that bargain and thats it

 but is it actually any more proof of her freedom if she lets a trope manifest through her instead

 though according to Sevar its more that Keltham just happened to land in a universe where the Queen will do what the trope wants and now at this point Abrogail is genuinely confused about who and what shes supposed to say fuck you to

But to be clear Isidre says cautiously if the Queen chooses of her own will not to cause a complication then the result is that weve proven tropes dont govern here Thats the only result correct Its not that our head of government blinks out of existence or is subjected to a godlike level of mind control

Right but the problem there is that this scenario doesnt look like the Queen entering into grownup negotiations for how to rent Carissa and that happening safely and with no complications It looks like there not being any particular need to rent Carissa to the Queen in the first place because the Queen is just busy running her region like a sane person

You are not fucking helping me make this decision little boy

I think that sane people occasionally take time off from running their country to sleep with people they are actually attracted to Isidre says

Intuitions only partly magical tell Abrogail that Isidre needs to make this statement incredibly blatantly sharp for a Chelish person so that it will come across as slightly sharp to Keltham Abrogail sends a side note to Sevar about how the very blatant sharpness is deliberate and why its there Sevar may need to note for her own future that Keltham may need very loud signals for them to be perceptible to him at all thats going to take some practice to calibrate right

Are Sevars thoughts by any chance flirtatious right now in the sense that Sevar is thinking things she knows will get her punished

Sevar cooperatively thinks that this is hilarious and Abrogail deserves every word of the takedown Keltham has no idea he is delivering

She is really really really not looking forward to the conversation thats going to happen after Aspexia Lrilatha and Gorthoklek all get ahold of all these transcripts Maybe she can take out her frustrations on Sevar afterwards

I agree in one sense and Im sorry that the Queen doesnt more often find people shes attracted to and doesnt have a wider field of choice But theres being Evil and then theres being stupid you know and messing around with the very important aliens girlfriend is definitely the latter thing if youre not being shoved around by tropes Actually even if she is being selected into existence by tropes from my standpoint shes still being unrealistically stupid from her own internal standpoint presumably theres some story shed tell herself but I dont know what it would be exactly

YOU REALLY ARE NOT HELPING YOUR CASE LITTLE BOY

And there is no hope in you for the case where Abrogail rents Carissa under terms agreeable to you they both have a fine time Abrogail doesnt go insane from overwork Carissa respects you more for having done a usual dominant thing and also gets to let out some steam in a way that youll probably learn quickly at 18 Intelligence but arent ready to do to her today none of this holds any hope for you at all

Let me put it this way I would be much more hopeful about it in a world where Pilar didnt go to Elysium Ione didnt deliver prophecies and if Asmodia comes back from the dead with superpowers I would just call the entire thing off

I do have enough pull myself to call in a Resurrection on Asmodia shortly and whoever does it can check whether or not she has superpowers

An earlier attempt at Raise Dead on Asmodia failed the fool couldnt manage to die by her own hand before Nidals shadows turned her into an undead shadow herself which requires Resurrection and a more expensive diamond Which however Cheliax now has

Im not actually confident I can call tropes that finely though I suppose now that Ive said it out loud its more likely to happen Not a bad test Id just as soon do it now if it needs doing anyways Unless Asmodia is otherwise enjoying Hell a lot and will be irate about being called back before the project has actually restarted I shouldve thought of that earlier actually

Hopefully though it varies by the person and in any case Im sure Asmodia will agree that the test youve proposed is good reason to call her back from Hell to Cheliax a little early Abrogail is really sure about this in fact Really really sure Bet her kingdom on it sure

Abrogail is mistaken but this is genuinely not her fault here

Make it so then

It shall be done Isidre says graciously though as a Paracountess of Cheliax even SlightlyTooGoodCheliax she is a little put out with Keltham giving her orders like that And if we find that nothing unusual has happened to Asmodia what does a rental agreement to the Queen of Cheliax look like

Look Im not sure that Asmodia failing to return with superpowers is enough of a test here It is not predicted that strongly by tropes it was halfway a joke before we started talking about it which yes makes the trope level stronger but not that much stronger The Queen is a much stronger trope and a much stronger test than that

But to answer your question the thing Id want to see before I rented Carissa to the Queen of Cheliax was sufficient cause to believe that if I had to fight with the Queen over Carissas love and sexuality and possession Id win Like not because a trope said so I dont think I can rely on that I mean win inside a normal Golarion universe

Affection is weakness and Carissa does not want to be weak Affection is weakness and Carissa does not want to be weak Affection is weakness and Carissa does not want to be weak

Shit shes supposed to be coming up with things for Isidre to say 

I think if you lose Carissa it wont be because the Queen stole her heart with her superior ruthlessness and sadism itll be because you shy away from using your own A girl can be happy with a wide range of masters but not with one who isnt Evil not with one who isnt interested in discovering whats in his heart however dark it is And I think youre at risk of that problem even if you tell the Queen to go on her merry way

I think Isidre says seriously if you lose Carissa it wont be because the Queen stole her heart with more ruthless sadism itll be because you shied away from using your own A girl can be happy with a wide range of masters but not with one who isnt Evil not with one who isnt interested in discovering whats in his heart however dark it is After hearing some of what you said earlier I do now worry youre more at risk of that problem even if the Queens advisors talk her out of the whole thing

Thought your earlier advice was not do anything I didnt want to

Im more worried now that youll want to and not do it anyways You were raised by a society that denies everything you are

Though may I also remind you that theres other women besides Carissa if it truly proves that she wants more from you than you want to give her

That denies everything you are stings the sort of sting where its got more than just one grain of truth in it even if the statement is obviously literally false

Keltham does have any social emotional dignity of course so hes not going to hold it against Isidre that she pointed it out And he also has any epistemic dignity so hes not going to automatically believe the whole thing and all its implications and connotations just because it stings

Anyways Keltham says The obvious thought for how I could prevent the Queen from winning Carissas heart through sadism is to write contract limitations on how much she can do to her there

Keltham you are a very sweet and innocent lad who grew up in an incredibly Lawful Good society with nothing resembling a Worldwound and this is in our case something of a problem Anything that the Queen would find satisfying and that would appease for a time the deeper and darker needs buried far inside Carissa that you are not ready for is something you are not ready to see written down as contract language

I would be very happy to write out language that I was confident would mean the Queen had not gone further than I would want her to go but I would not want you to see that language If that works for you we have a solution If you write down only permitted things that dont make a dath ilani worry then the two of them might as well not have sex

This is not really helping me feel like I can satisfy Carissa in the cuddleroom

Even when you are ready to do such things to Carissa she will not need them done to her very often Your usual activities in the bedroom will not be like that

And for you to deliver her with a smile into the gentle hands of the Queen of Cheliax would be cruelty in its own way and to your credit in her eyes I would much advise kissing her when you inform her of it

Carissa would not dream of presuming that Her Majesty is letting her own desire to torture Carissa get in the way of achieving their strategic objectives from this conversation but reminds Her Majesty just in case that Her Majesty can have Carissa without persuading Keltham of it since you know theyre lying to him about everything 

The new game Abrogail Thrune is now playing here looks a bit more like Do not actually end up attracting Sevar too much and subsequently end up married to Keltham Isidre wasnt lying about the rental arrangement contributing to that not happening

Not sent to Sevar of course

All right Im not quite sure how I feel about that but Im willing to entertain the idea You who does not actually want any complications here write a rental contract whose terms youre confident prevents the Queen from breaking Carissa or winning her affection away from me by being too much of a better sadist even if I cant read that part until possibly much later That handles sadism I think my brain is willing to believe that Carissa having an orgasm I cant give her yet is not actually a problem for our relationship

This leaves the problem of how to not have Carissa be attracted to somebody who maybe looks even more than me like somebody who could take absolute power over her It leaves the question of whether I can win if the Queen tries to fight me over who owns Carissa which is itself very much a trope I have my own idea but Id be interested in hearing what if anything you would think of as the most obvious solution No not just going ahead and demanding legal ownership of Carissa from Cheliax the second most obvious solution

 if Abrogail doesnt just lie here and she has now seen some of the consequences of lying to Keltham and having to live in the entire world you inadvertently created and shaped inside his head then Abrogail has to admit she is not immediately seeing it Abrogail Thrune wanting Carissa and Keltham wanting Abrogail Thrune to not have Carissa is not very likely to end realistically speaking with Abrogail Thrune sadly bereft of Carissa

What is he actually thinking though Come on Keltham Think of it Isidre thoughtfully consumes a snack Why arent you thinking there it is

Have the Queen sign a contract saying that she relinquishes all her potential ownership rights in Carissa Sevar under all possible future circumstances where she and Keltham dispute Sevars ownership to Keltham

Doesnt exactly cover the case where the Queen is abusing Governance powers to keep control of Carissa

Look the basic idea here is you cant actually have two people with de facto absolute power over the same person Either its true that I could get Carissa and have anything I want from her and nobody who tried could take her away or alternatively its true that the Queen could get Carissa and take everything she wants from her Or neither of these things can be true but they cant both be true simultaneously

If the basic premise of Carissas sexuality is that she is and should be with the person whod succeed in controlling her then if the Queen could successfully take her away from me Carissa is in a sense with me under false premises

So the question then becomes what is the truth here

What is Sevar thinking about this

She has EFFORTFULLY FENCED AWAY the part of her that thinks this is just really funny It is but this is not the time to think so and possibly she is not the person to think so

Her sincere honest answer is that Keltham is more something the phrase she immediately thought of is terrifyingly creative but shes 100 sure she will regret with great intensity having questioned the Queen of Cheliaxs terrifying creativity more dath ilani the space of solutions he draws from is larger and once he gets competent hell be able to use the Golarion pool too he clearly thought he had a way of doing safe Wishes that might work and she cant even tell him hes obviously wrong 

 anyway hes more something than the Queen of Cheliax and the Queen of Cheliax would beat him without trying in a ruthlessness contest or a solving your problems with any of murder petrification and mind control contest but Asmodeus has committed to letting Keltham leave Cheliax alive and in one piece and given that she thinks Keltham would win this contest if both of them were trying And also its obviously not in Cheliaxs interests to let it come to that though its maybe in Cheliaxs interests to make Keltham realize that he does actually want to be the person who would have absolute power over Carissa even if he doesnt quite yet want to exercise it 

SEVAR THINKS ABROGAIL FUCKING THRUNE WOULD LOSE TO 

 is a trope trying to provoke her here

Are you suggesting some sort of duel Isidre ventures cautiously This sounds like essentially the opposite of what we want here And I am to be honest a little concerned about your ability to take Abrogail Thrune in a direct contest of wills and powers

Wait why did Isidre say that Damn it Abrogail get ahold of yourself you have goals in this conversation

Well at least shes not straight up lying to him about that thats an encouraging sign

I havent the tiniest intention of fighting fair Isidre not against the Chief Executive of Cheliax The more impossible a problem is without cheating the more it means youre supposed to cheat

Shes more of a Good person than I am by the sound of things or Carissa thought she might not be that Good but her advisors certainly sound Good leaning All the good of Cheliax requires that you have no fun and that The Church of Asmodeus yoinks her political capital if she actually tries to take Sevar I can say Ill walk out on Cheliax if I lose Sevar to her and mean that because Im less Good than she is and have fewer existing bargains Im constrained by

Id expect Carissas sexuality to accept that coin if its a reasonable and logical sort of sexuality The question of who is more willing to use their power is very much the determinant of who actually would end up with absolute power over her who it is that if they so chose Carissa could not escape from

Tell him if hell walk out over me then he does win And that caring that much about me is indeed something the Queen cant compete with and the key to Carissas sexuality or as close to it as a person who still runs into a wall of Good every time he tries to have desires can comprehend it

Abrogail Thrune has not felt quite this irritated in some time She is a good Asmodean her compact requires it of her yes but thats not why she does it and so she has her pride In a room near to this one silently and unremarkedly precious things burn when youre at the eighth circle of sorcery you can do little things like that without bothering about the spells

Well Its clear enough that Sevar thinks that Keltham has already won this contest and with it her heart so the question then becomes does Abrogail Thrune choose to permit Sevar to go on believing that and to convince Keltham of it too

Being willing to go to lengths great enough to take possession of her is the key to Carissas sexuality indeed Isidre says No hint of coldness shows in her Abrogails Splendour is about her and she is no undisciplined child like these two Or as close to it as can be understood for now by a person who still runs into a wall of Good every time he tries to have desires about matters like that I think I have some idea of what youre planning now Id still want to hear it spelled out

That Carissas sexuality depends on the truth of two propositions that cant both simultaneously be true is itself very much a trope and one of the deepest and most powerful ones Even more than the Queen of Cheliax being a complication even more than her coming into conflict with me the deepest trope here has to be the question of fact what is really true Everything else fell into place once I realized that

My proposal is as simple as it is unfair to the Queen If I meet her and know her and think shes worthy of Carissa at all I offer to negotiate the rental agreement for Carissa In front of her advisors And with Carissa there to see it because shes the one who has to know this truth and witness it I say plainly a dath ilani does not bother to add and truthfully if theyre bothering to let words leave their mouth at all that Im worried about a more experienced sadist stealing Carissa from me and if the Queen of Cheliax does that successfully I will walk out on Cheliax and go make a revolution somewhere else I say that I want guarantees about my right signed by the government of Cheliax and by the Queen and by the Church of Asmodeus in whatever capacity Asmodeus recognizes such things to take Carissa with me if that happens potentially including against her own will if I so choose to somewhere that puts enough value on a dath ilani to also recognize my possession of her

Having that right doesnt mean Id actually exercise it obviously but nobody needs to say that in front of the Queen and while Carissa might know what I wouldnt really do I think shell also understand the romantic gesture in the spirit in which it was intended

If everybodys being sane the Queen and her advisors are like sure sounds weirdly extreme but hes obviously doing it to impress his girlfriend they sign on like the totally sane grownups they are The limits on the Queens sadism are in a sealed section of the compact that I trust you to write The conflict and the trope have been defused easily enough to call into severe question whether there was ever really any trope at work in the first place

If the Queen is like why no how could I possibly do that I have strange reasons I cannot do that then we know shes a giant trope avatar and theres a foretold path of conflict and complication whose core question of truth is who Carissa Sevar really belongs to both de facto and in terms of her core sexuality because those two are the same thing

In which case obviously I stop negotiating that rental agreement get back to my new research installation and both we and the Queens advisers do everything we can to keep the Queen and Carissa apart for as long as possible We do everything we can to like totally slow down all of that from actually happening if that is at all possible and try to delay everything into the future as far as possible because like I already have a job

Eventually either the Queen loses power or the two of us reconcile and kiss or if I screw up along the way the Queen wins and Cheliax stays poor for longer Or Golarion ends up falling to the Worldwound because there wasnt really anywhere else that could offer the resources that Cheliax and Asmodeus could I suppose theres other possibilities within the tropes that would then almost have to be governing but Id have to think hard about what they were theyd be less probable

It seems possible that Carissa having feelings for Keltham is actually relevant as a qualification to pull this off Because Carissa unlike literally every other person in this operation doesnt underestimate him 

She doesnt know which specific thoughts in the last little bit have merited punishment but she has this feeling its not going to be half an hour one way or another

Doesnt matter Hell is forever and she can endure that too

All right Abrogail thinks she is going to have to proceed under the assumption that the tropes are real and govern here

Her reasoning is not complicated why Sevar herself might see it if Sevar had the requisite 6 headband of all mental attributes

Keltham thinks hes describing a future event that he has to arrange in accordance with tropes That event has already happened without Keltham knowing it He has been fighting the true Queen this entire time in front of Carissa and apparently to Carissa for now won

In dath ilans rhythm of prediction success credibility that is a victory he has won

Abrogail has worked out by now a wordless sort of apprehension as to what sort of things tropes are namely things out of stories except that theyre not the tropes of Cheliax or Golarion theyre the tropes of dath ilan But if dath ilan has per transcript girls who dream of becoming Dark Unilateral Rulers then dath ilan surely also has a trope for appearing to have won when you havent because the person youre fighting is smarter than you and you never knew how many of your plans were known to her from the beginning

More the fool Keltham if that thought hasnt occurred to him and more the fool Carissa if knowing the true place of the Queen of Cheliax in all of this it hasnt occurred to her to wonder the same

 or she could just not decide to do any of that and then her life wouldnt be a trope

Possibly then there wouldnt be any tropes around at all shes not sure how that works

Ice and fire alternate in an unoccupied room nearby Cycling between the two prevents the floors and walls from melting its not Abrogails first time venting emotion where her adversaries will not see that and be warned

In the end the logic behind Abrogails last decision here is simple

She doesnt actually want to spend the rest of her life like this

Shed rather not be a trope

In fact she now deeply desires that there be no tropes anywhere near Cheliax Ever

And while shes not quite sure that this is how any of this works shes going to do her part there

Well then Isidre says and sighs I suppose you should go back and talk to Carissa and determine how she feels about being rented to the Queen and I should see if you can meet the Queen at least briefly And then maybe move directly to the confrontation with her and her advisors in sight of Carissa then or very soon after If everyone is sane which I do expect them to be Keltham it should actually get done quite quickly or I certainly hope so because these are all very busy people But time today is no more time than time tomorrow and if possible we may as well get this done while we can do it without burning Teleports

You know now that Im thinking about actually doing this Im worried I may be about to make my life way more complicated than it actually needed to be

Asmodeus Himself is literally the only being who could possibly have ordained that Keltham not be a pile of ash in this moment

Keltham Im sorry but my time really is up now Isidre says I do think Id recommend going ahead with this course of action over leaving things as they are because I do still believe in the end that sanity will triumph I have no time to do more planning than this with you not now I fear Talk to Carissa and let me know whether to move forward on meeting and then confronting the Queen

All right Sorry for having taken this much of your time Ill let you know my decision

Isidre nods to him still very graciously and rises to go

Can she get away with having Lrilatha and Gorthoklek done by illusion No damn her to Abaddon because Keltham knows that Lrilatha is one of her advisors and may try to talk to Lrilatha and without the actual Lrilatha no illusionist is going to successfully fake whatever Law Keltham finds recognizable in Lawful Evil outsiders Lrilatha is absofuckinglutely going to tell Rugatonn and Gorthoklek to actually show up for this

This isnt going to be fun At least not for her

 and one way or another in due time she will have her fun

Just as soon as she can figure out how to do it without that being a trope

Carissa is waiting in the next room Kneeling It seems wisest She wonders if she is supposed to declare herself Security screened and go back to Keltham or do her punishment first She has no other opinions at all If you were only reading her thoughts now it wouldnt be obvious shes previously had any other opinions

Enough of this self willed stupidity Abrogail says not bothering to leash her temper from her words backed by full Splendour You are performing important work of Asmodeus that I personally delegated to you Thoughts are required of you to accomplish your function slave of Asmodeus You will now start having thoughts or I will hurt you until you do

 fine 

Youll hurt me either way

Ill hurt you more if you dont obey Thats always been the way of Hell

Do you know who else in Cheliax besides Keltham does not think only what he thinks other people around him want him to think Me You want your Lawful Evil dath ilanism That much of it stands before you

Enough of your lies to yourself to your thoughts you have taken things far past the point where even you can pretend to yourself that nothing is wrong and I will not permit you to pretend to yourself to be nothing

Do you love Keltham

 what

I was reading your mind what little of it you permitted to exist He won the contest for you against the Queen of Cheliax he earned himself the key to your soul I saw your triumph when he did You will not be made a statue for your answer one way or another but the Crown now orders you to answer and in truth What are you to Keltham now Are you his mistress His slave Has he stepped before Asmodeus in your heart and become your god

 no she says because that much at least is clear uh To the last one He doesnt have my soul he doesnt have real power over me that isnt the game we all play with this first life Asmodeus owns me Asmodeus has always owned me Keltham would have to rule Hell to be my god or take me somewhere else and you know perfectly well I dont belong somewhere else and they wouldnt let me in

Truth if Sevars thoughts to herself are not complete lies You love Keltham and if you dont like it put that way feel free to say what he is to you instead Will you then obediently continue lying to him working against his best interests and tempting him from Axis into Hell

Yes because human emotions are a terrible guide to decisionmaking and being unfortunate enough to occasionally suffer them does not make me beholden to them

Abrogail laughs then cold and clear and dark like midnight high upon some mountaintop Fair enough little Lawful Evil dath ilani I suppose its what I told you to become Love him use your love to seduce him choose without emotion to betray is that the path you would now walk

Ive gotten somewhat wary of predicting how this is going to go But for as long as no one can figure out how to safely lie to him were going to have to give him people who almost arent lying And then obviously make sure they dont have a shadow of an opening to actually choose him but I dont You would hunt me down if we fled to Lastwall you would hunt me down if we fled to Sothis you would hunt me down if we fled to Heaven and again I do actually hate them and they wouldnt let me in

Trustworthy for now perhaps as long as she doesnt begin to believe that Keltham her perfect shining Keltham who won her from the Queen of Cheliax might also come to have the power to stay Hell and to defeat Asmodeus Himself Abrogail forbears to point this out it will become a note in Sevars file

I assign you no further tortures Sevar Do not mistake this for mercy but only me taking care not to tread on my senior partners games Rugatonn it will be who decides whether all this heresy you are thinking and the emotions in your heart constitute a matter that we would not proactively at all correct with pain and torment in the ordinary course of Asmodeuss Law

Let us pray that Asmodeus did foresee that I would visit your bedroom that everything now within your heart is only another piece of His own grand design that we all remain on a pathway He has laid out for us because Hell help us all if we have left it

Go then to your lover foolish and pathetic child and learn from him to become something greater than this

Oh and good luck convincing him to rent you out I honestly had no idea at the time why that was something you wanted in the first place and in retrospect I wonder if I should have had somebody ask you that instead of jumping on the opportunity

Abrogail Thrune claps her hands and disappears which is to say that some distance away Abrogail Thrune dispels her illusion She does not actually have the time to stand around there and talk to Carissa Sevar

Because it has as predicted been incredibly effective at getting Keltham to be possessive and to think of himself as in a contest for ownership of his girlfriend and to get him to feel jealous and insecure about the idea that someone else might own her more truly or hurt her more meaningfully and to generally change modes to one where hes trying to prove himself within the Chelish system 

She doesnt argue 

She returns to Kelthams suite

Is your proposal here that we read in a couple hundred people on everything we know about the secret that may have started the godwar so that the betting markets resolve

Yes the Prince Merenre says Precisely because something about the situation may have started a godwar Its important so we need to be competent to reason about it so the betting markets need to be something more than a fancy layer of fuzziness on top of all my personal guesses

I trust precisely thirty people with this says the pharaoh of Osirion And all of them know better than to bet against you ever about anything where they dont have inside information

In principle we can fix that with more lopsided payoffs says Merenre They cant be infinitely confident in my being better than them

I predict their bets against you will cluster around yours if theyre allowed to know yours and maybe even if they arent What I want here is people wholl think of something you havent And less of a spread because come on this is ridiculous 

Where are the markets at right now a serious stiff robed priest asks

Our eighty percent confidence interval spans totally useless except to Abadar and three mathematicians to the destruction of the multiverse

 how are they even resolving that 

Oh the usual Thats not the point the point is I cant govern like this

What if we get predictors from Axis says the King Consort Theyve got better participation than us theres a convenient list of exactly who to ask

Cant afford them

If this project is as important as the 50th percentile projection we can give them the Sphinx

 theres a policy proposal I guess raffle off every archeological relic in the country except our God in his wisdom has copies of all of them already 

Can you ask Him to pay to subsidize the prediction markets in Aktun says Merenre tiredly This is technically a breach of protocol theyre not supposed to acknowledge even in private that the person of the pharaoh is not the person of Abadar Himself but its been a long two days since they first learned from Abadar of a complicated situation 

We subsidize all the prediction markets in Aktun says the pharaoh who is not actually the person of Abadar Himself but is closer than most mortals come and doesnt use the we just as an affectation Theres still the security question There are reasons that sometimes when there are ongoing wars you dont just subsidize a bunch of public markets

Fe Anar the Pharaohs father mutters a phrase in the fast changing language of the Maelstrom which no one who doesnt talk to proteans at least weekly or have permanent Tongues could hope to understand it translates approximately to lol fuck the security question 

The pharaoh has permanent Tongues and also did not need it to know what his father was going to say there One thing We would pay a lot to resolve is odds that Osirion and Cheliax end up at war over this he says sharply and I expect Hell would also observe that with fascination And while We dont find the arguments for squishing anomalies before they change Golarion persuasive obviously and are appalled that thats been policy for so many millenia obviously Were trading with a lot of entities that do find those concerns persuasive But really Wed make it all public in Axis subject to some standard nondisclosure agreements if it werent obviously an avenue for interference by Hell

Theyve got to have their own predictions

Only relevant market public in Hell is the one for the souls of some various adjacent parties which uh keeps getting more expensive I dont know how to interpret that exactly 

Fe Anar mutters a phrase in the fast changing language of the Maelstrom which translates best to fuck Hell 

Amen says everyone else fervently they keep on top of how the Maelstrom says that one 

Is there not says Merenre some kind of ordinary Aktun market participation contract understood to be robust against Hell really Im astonished that all Aktun market participation contracts arent understood to be robust against Hell 

Theyre robust in the sense that if theyre fucking around Well take their money in the long run

And that long run is measured in transaction volume What goes wrong if we just subsidize it

That long run is measured in transaction volume and also in time for arbitration courts to make them eat penalty clauses thatre still financial in nature 

So pay the courts to work inside a time dilated demiplane With all earned respect if this has a one in ten chance of being as important as it looks you arent spending enough money on it

I literally cannot afford to spend money on ten things like this so I need some way to figure out which one is going to get me more than a math textbook

The arbitration courts do already run at whatever speed is necessary for them to resolve in the contractually obligatory time Thats a month sidereal for current events prediction markets observes a sparkling ball of gears floating above one of the conference table seats 

Do they promise they wont speed up and start settling everything overnight

They do not says the sparkling ball of gears with what might be faint amusement

First prediction market says the King Consort Pay a hundred top performers in Axis with a share of future returns from the work of Abadars new cleric to get up to speed and then predict whatll go wrong if we make the betting open in Axis and try to beat Hell at what is in the end our game more than theirs

The future returns from the project arent ours

The clerics ours 

The clerics so its not clear he is is the thing Abadars tried to show me what Hes looking at but I dont understand it and I certainly dont know that he considers himself to have entered into a trade relationship with us where we can conditionally commit his resources according to our model of what hell be willing to pay for later 

A share of future returns from the project conditional on the target agreeing that this market served his interests 

Not to harp on this too much but all of what was just proposed plus inside time dilation were already later to this than Id like because of the Zon Kuthon war 

Because of the Zon Kuthon war We have fewer resources to run bits of Aktun in time dilation than Wed like

Can you put numbers when you say things like that like precisely how much time dilation can we have at what multiplier on its usual cost

I really cant

I mean give me an order of magnitude 

If Abadar were able to put orders of magnitude in His visions then We would have so many fewer problems

Proposal a communication to the target in Cheliax to the effect subsidizing prediction market in Aktun evaluate policy questions relevant to you with promised share project returns reply yes no

Cheliax is we believe committed to not murdering him if in their evaluation he starts to look dangerous to their interests but theyre neither above nor prohibited from neglecting to prevent his capture by Nidal Which isnt to say not to contact him it might be worth it its just to say I continue to want some way of evaluating these ideas before we try them other than gut instinct

Yeah all right

Market now contact him in the dead of night if the market thinks its a good idea ready to grab him if he decides to leave Cheliax 

Have you learned anything from the last two days says the pharaoh We will make absolutely no plans with a twelve hour time horizon Who knows which gods will be at war by then

Cayden Cailean has taken more of Himself out of Elysium than is wise He has gathered more of His attention which is His self into one place than is wise It is not easy for a god to truly spy on the mortal realm and it comes with a risk

The more powerful Lawful Evil gods who would leap on Him and tear Him asunder if they saw Him so vulnerable Asmodeus and Zon Kuthon are respectively exhausted and sealed wounded maybe dying There would be very little appetite for another godwar while the world is just recovering from a previous one that ended only hours ago and Cayden Cailean would be more defended than Zon Kuthon Even so it is not the sort of behavior pattern You adopt if You want to live forever or even for another thousand years statistically speaking

But with Nethys also exhausted now they have few other options for knowing what they must know

The meeting He is spying upon concludes and Cayden Cailean sends a message

Meeting in Osirion went mostly as Nethyss Scenario 2 but there were substantial divergences Spoke of Keltham as Abadars cleric rather than the Otherworlder prediction markets unsure of Kelthams impact rather than solidly on technological revolution of Golarion substantial credence to the multiverse ending up destroyed

Disquieting Still I think we have little choice but to proceed as if we have not yet wandered off Nethyss road I hope He returns to us before we leave it fully

Theyre so eager to work with Keltham So ready for everything Keltham could offer them They want so much to be his Civilization wanted it long before Keltham came here and all they lack they believe are the things that Aktun is forbidden to tell them that Keltham knows

What happens when Keltham reaches Osirion is going to break their heart

Assuming we are still sufficiently on Nethyss pathways that Keltham enters Osirion at all The divergences have already begun

What of it

I am tempted to meddle After so much much time of having to conserve our strength and choose our opportunities running around doing things is quite addictive I observe the mortals so closely and I find Myself thinking Is there some way I could meddle and make it go less sadly for these few mortals personally I like them

Not to go all Lawful Good on you Cayden but to agonize over the hurt feelings of a handful of souls youve spied upon in the light of other stakes and other costs seems too Chaotic Good even for Me

But go ahead and meddle if you can find any way to do it that promotes the interests of Pharasma and Asmodeus relative to what wouldve happened otherwise And our own interests of course And keeps to Nethyss road while it lasts And doesnt give away exactly whats playing out to opposed gods like Abadar

I keep thinking to myself that I need another drink and yet I cannot imagine how much mead would be enough to deal with this crap

Before Carissa gets back to Kelthams current suite shes intercepted by a Security who informs her that Maillol is if not exactly fully functional functional enough to receive her handoff Sevar keeps going out of contact and thats not fun for Project Lawful

Understood They should really be training a Carissa impersonator to substitute for her but also its very much to her advantage that she thinks they dont have anyone

 that means she should also probably take her punishment before she goes back to Keltham and shes currently in the wrong mental state for it namely euphoric and full of giddy terror but shes not actually the out of control child Abrogail seems to think she can talk herself around She trots over to the temple and contemplates dath ilani Lawful Evil which they do tell stories about apparently Evil Keepers who wield the Law for their own benefit She wants to be that Cheliax doesnt understand dath ilan but it does understand how to harden Evil in someones heart how to turn human weaknesses in so they feed Evil impulses not Good ones She needs that And she deserves punishment because she erred and doesnt want to blunder through the world unpunished until she faces the ultimate punishment for an error too big to overlook Asmodeus said to punish her as his Law requires because otherwise shell err too far before reality shows up to correct her 

Keltham has her childish stupid heart because hes rich and powerful and willing to walk away from Cheliax over her and its very cute but Cheliax owns her body and soul and this is in the evaluation of a system designed for punishing weakness and building Evil in human hearts what she needs 

There thats better She will just have to not let all that Asmodean conviction be shaken by the sight of Maillol 

If you werent Chelish you wouldnt be able to tell that Maillol is shaken hurting doesnt have it fully together and keeps trying to figure out if theres some way he can be not on this project Having been the recipient of two visions from Asmodeus makes it effectively impossible he may know now things that he cant put into words

Maillol wants to be not on Project Lawful when it hits day 4 Day 3 was in fact past his limit

The sight of Sevar looking not particularly emotional not that hed be able to tell if she has her own act together does not please him Even knowing how much Sevar who helped make this bed is probably also going to have to lie in it with the Queen for longer there is still a flash of hatred in him for her having not saved him from what was almost entirely his own mistake

Maillol has not been informed of what actually happened there and very very few people in Abrogail Thrunes dominion ever will be Spreading such gossip about Her Infernal Majestrix if you are a Security reading Sevars thoughts say is the kind of conduct that gets you turned into a statue or sent to whatever other fate is your worst realizable fear

He accepts the project handoff questions Sevar about a few of the Keltham budget items she approved thinking and talking mostly on reflex

What does he think of the possibility of demonstrating Suggestion to Keltham with his advance consent probably having Lrilatha do it because he finds it credible that she obeys Asmodeus directly and then swearing to him it hasnt been done otherwise in order to get him to agree an adversarial Cheliax would be running rings around him with mind control

Maillol has to think hard about this and strain bruised portions of his mind What was Asmodeuss will He said not to enchant Keltham Did He really convey exactly that when He spoke not at all in words Its hard to blank out all of your own guesses about what Asmodeus could be planning what Asmodeus could have intended to ask what Asmodeus meant when what you need is to hear what Asmodeus told you to do and the concepts and bounds set around it were neither your own nor mortal at all

Ill authorize it he says Make sure you tell Keltham exactly what youre going to do get his permission for exactly that do exactly that no tricks no games no cleverness no taking advantages nothing else youre trying to accomplish on the side as if Keltham could read your own thoughts down to the depth of your soul and dont assume that Contessa Lrilatha already knows that tell it to her anyways Maillol is writing down those instructions even as he speaks they cannot be entrusted to memory

I understand Thank you

Right Thats that over with then 

She notices herself trying to think of something else to say and makes herself turn and walk away towards the torture chamber

Children tend superstitious its worse if you cry its worse if you dont its worse if you seem scared Carissas not a child She doesnt know the heart of whoevers on staff she doesnt know what they enjoy seeing it probably doesnt matter very much The benefits dont derive from the punishment being executed exactly correctly anything that requires that much finesse can only happen in Hell There is to a first approximation nothing at all she can do that will matter 

Torture details spoilered

Its the second most physically painful experience of her life and opening Abrogails gift bag earlier helps a lot to appreciate how much it could be worse Unlike Abrogails bag which is meant to amuse Abrogail to think of it disciplinary torture is meant to educate and improve the soul and not just be pleasing to Asmodeus

They show you whats coming to let you contemplate your error They apply it only somewhat painfully at first so you can still think coherently about your mistake and fear how much worse its going to get and regret and then they make it worse and worse to drive the behavior firmly out of you once youve had that chance to fix in your mind what you did wrong and how much you regret it

If you want your pain to mean something if you want to relate productively to your own torture and suffering Asmodeuss torturers are doing all the right things to make sure you can At least if youve been sent in for corrective torture and not this is the fate you should have feared and now you have earned it torture

The Queens order calls for the corrective sort of torture Its a good thing that happened before Abrogail became less optimistic about whether Sevar could be salvaged or more personally annoyed with her

It lasts a lot longer At least Carissa thinks so she never actually asked how long the bag lasted This had a duration written neatly on the scroll she turned in And shes pretty sure its longer because her voice is much much hoarser and her face much stickier with snot and tears and she gets tired in a way she doesnt think she has before random uninjured muscles screaming about having been tense for so long

Itll be worse in Hell 

She understands her mistakes better She wont make them again There isnt another way to get this result dath ilan tries to do everything with rewards but that just builds stunted little Good people whod go to Abaddon rather than not get their fair share of a deal 

Carissa would never ever go to Abaddon If you told her this was all that was left to her forever more of this she wouldnt go to Abaddon She is strong where the people of dath ilan are weak she can live in worlds they cant 

She hopes someone is reading her mind because she requests healing adequate to conceal signs of injury from Keltham but cant seem to make her mouth move right now

Sevars still in the middle of important work and the palace torture room has a fairly serious priest on staff even with the war and also with the war on fewer people are being tortured in the palace than usual

Cure Moderate Wounds Restoration Have a nice day

Right Keltham Her Keltham feelings have been all burned out which is good she didnt even remember to focus on that Maybe love is just the kind of emotion that automatically dies faced with anything real

She washes her face and fixes her hair and goes back to Keltham

Keltham has no idea that Carissa was in a much better mood half an hour earlier

He asks how her Security screening went That took a while

It did they were way more thorough than usual spent a bunch of time on asking me trick questions under a Truth Spell which I must say is kind of unpleasant and they made me do everything with the headband off and with it on Im not actually complaining it feels like all the security Cheliax knows how to throw at a thing like this just barely might be adequate for the actual stakes 

I did get the chance to ask about whether the absolutely no messing with Keltham no matter how justified it looks order would permit consensually demonstrating to you mind control spells and the person who was the direct recipient of Asmodeuss vision thought yes with enough precautions and advance communication so if thats something you want to see demonstrated seems to be allowed

Seems a little scary the mind control experiment I mean but you gotta be able to do slightly scary things that seem clearly necessary and that one does Lets move forwards on it no first I want your own direct opinion on whether theyre going to be able to find someone to run the experiment who is really actually extremely that trustworthy

One of the precautions was itd be Contessa Lrilatha I think shes that trustworthy anyway but with a direct order from Asmodeus involved theres no question

Thatd do it Keltham is actually slightly impressed that was better than hed visualized being possible to get himself

Keltham has met with Isidre again Many things were discussed of which he can only tell Carissa some right away so as not to give her impression that the parts hes talking about were all that happened Isidre does think its safe to ask Carissa some direct questions of the what happens if I do this type

Carissad be happy to answer those

Okay Uh for a start Kelthams going to do the thing where some questions matter more than others but hes going to mix them up to not make it too blatant what sort of answers hes looking for He doesnt know if they have the sort of relationship where Keltham can do that without explicitly announcing it which is better obviously in terms of not biasing the subject Do they have the sort of relationship where Keltham can do that sort of thing and its okay so long as Carissa gets told about the shenanigans within a reasonably short time afterwards

Hes so not cute Contemptible not cute

Yes you can do that I dont even particularly feel wronged if you try to conceal which questions you care about the most and then dont tell me afterwards you were doing that in Cheliax sometimes people are just doing that and its considered fair enough

I mean in dath ilan sometimes they dont tell you for years what the experiment was about but theres explicit understandings there that I didnt want to assume would automatically carry over to Golarion and you

Also I just realized that I went and asked is it okay if instead of ordering you to tell me the consequences of something sorry brain tired from Isidre discussion I think for tonight I may ask I think for tonight Im ordering you to take the questions I ask in dath ilani speech patterns and reinterpret them to be about me ordering you to tell me things I dont intend on doing that all the time but that was a tiring conversation and its been a day

Hypothetical what happens if Keltham managed to hurt Carissa enough that she yelled Stop without realizing what she was doing and then Keltham reacted to that by immediately removing her from her chains even if Carissa apologized and said to continue Obviously thats not going to break Carissa or anything Keltham wants to know the hypothetical effects on their relationship is Carissa turned off confused is it generally good or bad for them

 not confused thats the thing I predict youd do I think mostly Id feel embarrassed and like it broke something that I did that and if we dont address it at all then itll be a hole I need to steer around in the future

True answers are perhaps predictably harder to produce when youve burned all your feelings out She feels like shes producing them by imagining some other Carissa

Hypothetical Keltham starts requesting Detect Desires and truthspells from his god and using those to find out what Carissa wants and treating a thus extracted admission of wanting something as a reason to believe that its fine for him to do whatever it is to her

 wow Uh The second part is definitely excellent the first part is a little scary but not in a way where shed say no even if this were a saying no sort of relationship 

 yeah thats not really the answer youd expect from a dath ilani woman possibly even one single dath ilani woman alive but it has already dawned on Keltham that hes not in Default anymore

Hypothetical effects on relationship if Keltham had gone ahead and done that without asking Carissa about it at all

Youd get a different way of me relating to you I think Where I try to do less steering because youre doing more of it and try to give you more of myself to work with 

He needs to dare anything ever to ever test the things that are being claimed to him by Carissas nine year old level self reporting if hes going to make this relationship work at all

Keltham without any other warning taps Carissa with one of his Truthspells Tell me the effect of what I just did to you on our relationship

Carissa does not need that dismissed yet she thinks loudly The entire point of not lying to Keltham is to be able to do this

I think Im feeling things a little less intensely now than I usually would because Im still a bit fried from the last couple hours she says Uh obeying Security when theyre being very intense is sort of the same reservoir of something except without the payoff With that said yeah I feel delighted that you did that that you knew you could do that and slightly stressed about the truth spell its an enchantment it feels like one I know its not a very invasive enchantment 

The illusion on her forehead has not flickered at all

Keltham essays a Detect Magic for lack of a Greater Detect Magic the spell on Carissa looks to him like the one he cast

 um

Should he just keep doing this It seems like cheating It seems a lot like cheating It seems like the sort of cheating that means nobody ever wants to cofound a startup with you Carissa just said she was delighted under the truthspell that he did it You could establish an awful lot of trust that way modulo the chance that after they saw his first truthspell they were very thoroughly prepared or maybe prepared before the first truthspell etcetera he didnt request Invisibility Purge today

The common sense of dath ilan says to like think dangerous things through before you do dangerous things not try to improvise them as you go Especially when you have two more Truthspells to use later if needed shit he shouldve cast Augury before he tried that oh well hell get used to having magic eventually

Is there anything he needs to ask right now 

Im not going to be upset if the spell fails here or if you cant give the answer you wished you could Keltham says Are your self reports to me about what youre pretty sure wont hurt you likely to be accurate Not honest accurate

I really think so Once we start doing things I havent done before I will be less sure but then Ill tell you Im less sure I know Im not dath ilani but you cant actually be an arms and armor enchanter while kidding yourself about whether things are going to work out the way you want them to

Keltham exhales feeling a bit shaky himself She could just be consistently mistaken on all levels of reflection of course but its something youd expect somebody to notice if they were routinely wrong about that sort of thing He feels like he just girlfriend gets thoughts access I feel like I just stepped off a very narrow ledge I was standing on but there happened to be something underneath my foot to support it

You can step outside and ask Security to dispel that if you cant dispel it yourself or resist it or whatever I have two more truthspells should probably keep one in reserve but you can request the other one later if you think of something you want to say and have me trust Of course then she gets more time to prepare a deception but he could also just tap her two days later and ask if there was a deception then Oh he should check that now First though answer as soon as this question finishes do you have any knowledge about the results of my last truthspell having been faked

She doesnt know she doesnt know thats always the safe thing to lean on with truth spells not knowing what instance hes referring to not knowing what anyone did No Shes totally uncertain whether thatd have gotten through or not and if not whether Security managed to cancel it and do an illusion in time but shell proceed as if one of those things happened They shouldve been ready with the illusion at least from answer as soon as this question finishes I dont actually know when the last time you used a truthspell was she continues Did you use one with Isidre that might have been faked shes powerful enough to cast that anti Enchantment spell that your god gave you for the Kuthites and I bet she knows it Uh the last truth spell I remember you using was on Tonia the first day and I have no knowledge of that being faked A definite lie but if Security couldnt get a replacement in place by then they deserve 

do they

 well regardless they will suffer much worse than what Carissa just did and she wont be sorry

 okay that could have been an instance of her quickly telling herself that she didnt know what he really meant by that and delaying for somebody else to cast dispel illusion etc If so theyre presumably prepared for this but Keltham casts Detect Magic anyways

Looks as hed expect 

Are you done A good very obedient Carissa without an edge in her voice I can dispel it once youre done but you can keep going if its helping Or if its not but you want to

Im done You can dispel it yourself or get it dispelled whatevers more convenient

He did notice a possibility but theres nothing obvious to do with the paranoia most possible paranoia is not valuable on the margins Hell keep his eyes open to see if theres a pattern

Also if that thought he had was true that implies the honesty of Carissas earlier statements about her probably accurate self reports to him and that she was delighted to see him suddenly use truthspell on her neither of which match up all that well to its all a LARP everything around you is a LARP

She dispels it Are you okay

Think so Just a little sad not about your answers or anything just that I cant give you full immediate girlfriend access to everything I thought about them Hes probably not supposed to say the thing that he just thought in case it was true after all Are you okay

I am okay but my day has featured a lot more tricky Truth Spelling than my days usually do and I am slightly less okay than I normally will be if you do that

He shouldve seen that coming stupid Girlfriend right Feel stupid not because it wasnt worth it but because I shouldve seen that part coming But it was worth it or at least Id evaluate so

Is this a hugging situation or a hugs are not a solution to the problem I have situation

Hugsre good Seems worth it seems important for you to feel like you can trust us thats why I asked about the Contessa Lrilatha thing even though I saw her briefly in the hallways and apparently Cheliax being at war makes her ten times more terrifying

Hugs Its still so weird to think that your military people and your Governance people are the same people like failure of professional specialization much

I wish I didnt have to say this but I have more tricky sexuality self report questions to ask you even though it sounds like this is not at all a great time for that Theres a time sensitive question Im considering of the type window of opportunity to do a nice thing rather than disaster prevention type Not so time sensitive we couldnt cuddle for a few minutes before resuming

Luckily Security didnt ask me anything at all about my sexuality so Im not very tired of talking about that actually correcting that they asked if youd inflicted any injuries requiring healing and they asked if youd asked me to conceal anything from them under questioning But mostly they did not ask about my sexuality and Im not in fact tired of talking about it

Headpats Positive reinforcement for noticing you said a false thing and then correcting it

Uh dath ilan thing youd do that with a child someone practicing the first layer of the Truthspeaking virtue until the things they said started being mostly true the first time

Literally everything Carissa just said was a lie orchestrated to convince Keltham she was practicing the first layer of the Truthspeaking virtue so why does she feel pleased about the headpats Probably because it means she succeeded

Keltham asks more tricky questions about Carissas sexuality

Hypothetical Keltham feels like he owes Tonia a debt for her own Suddenly Truthspell and doesnt have any money to repay it yet What happens to Carissa and their relationship if with zero warning Tonia is suddenly there inside their cuddleroom and Carissa gets ordered to serve her cuddlewise with no pleasure for Carissa herself and then Keltham walks out of the room and leaves her to it

Thatd be a very reasonable thing for you to do and Id feel comfortable with it I dont know if Id enjoy it depends on details and execution and Id enjoy it more if you stayed but Id still feel comfortable if you didnt

How does it change the relationship impact if Keltham had warned Carissa asked her about it well in advance checked to make sure that she was attracted to Tonia before sending her in and basically asked her for permission to do that in advance of doing it

Uh it loses the thing where its hot to be yours to have you doing as you like with me to need to be on my feet And I guess it avoids some risk where I passionately hate Tonia and would be miserable But at the expense of making it kind of pretend But Id try not to be bothered by that because I know youre new at this

More sexuality questions follow Some of them seem really obviously impossible like the hypothetical about Keltham telling Carissa that hes figured out exactly how to make the Starstone work and he wants to ascend her as the new god of pleasing Keltham sexually

 no Because you can die for real of that

I think this should be very obvious but dont trust what you can verify Among the things that Ill literally never do is ask you to break an oath If it sounds like I was asking for that I wasnt if Im still asking for it after you request clarification knock me unconscious and get me to Security to check for compulsions

 noted and also I wouldnt obey you if you did ask that and it was actually you and you werent under compulsions Thats not Im Evil Shrug And Im a big fan of continuing to exist so Im going to do that no matter what

Thats very relieving to hear and Im not going to explain why unless you ask Keltham hugs Carissa as hard as he can she is presumably hard to hurt by doing that and if not hes got healing

Their relationship has ANY LEGIBLE RULES now And they have COMMON KNOWLEDGE about that

Hug well now Im kind of curious

It wasnt entirely clear that there was any thing such that you would look at it and go nope not that thing that was not part of the deal This could potentially indicate a state of affairs where you were actually okay with everything or could alternatively indicate a general failure of your ability to detect what you were not okay with We have now ruled out the second possibility

Hug You dont get my eternal soul and you dont get to destroy it Im going to live forever and I feel incredibly strongly about that I wouldve specified sooner if you had any way to do that which you do not

Though the thought now crosses her mind that perhaps shes supposed to sell her soul to Keltham Thats definitely Lawful Evil sufficient all by itself Lawful Evil and maybe the sort of thing he could be tempted into down the line

This would be a dangerous thing to say to a dath ilani like four years younger than me Im successfully preventing my brain from executing your just submitted search request for clever ways to destroy eternal souls but I wouldnt have been able to stop it from running four years ago

Anyways Lets say that Ive demonstrated that no I actually did figure out the Starstone youre not the first patient I already got all the other girls and theyre all gods and doing great But when its your turn in the line I then say actually Carissa instead of becoming god of magical weapon creation Id personally be happy about it if you became god of pleasing Keltham sexually You dont have to do it its not an order but Ive noticed it would make me very happy says future Keltham

Im not going to make commitments on behalf of godCarissa shes going to be much smarter And also probably not have a sexuality I dont think thats even how gods work

Youre evaaaading the queeessstion Least Convenient Possible World it turns that right before you touch the Starstone you have to say what youre going to be god of In fact that is the thing that makes the Starstone work the previous successful candidates just stumbled into that And you get to have a sexuality if youre a god of a sexy thing

And this isnt you can become a god but only if you become a god of what Keltham who is sponsoring you for godhood wants 

Nope This is like total victory scenario we got here after you spent a few years with a mountain of spellsilver I say that I consider myself to have been incredibly well repaid for everything Ive ever done for you the Starstone is right there and Im not exerting any control over it you just say what you want to be god of and then touch it It just so happens that I would be really happy if you said god of sexually pleasing Keltham instead of whatever youd have said if I hadnt made that request Actually what are you god of otherwise Cant evaluate the question without knowing what youre passing up

What a normal boyfriend girlfriend conversation

im not sure gods actually have like mortals say theyre the god of something but I dont know that thats actually what gods think they are I guess Id be the Lawful Evil god of self improvement and study

Irori briefly glances in a certain direction of aspiration but it doesnt look like a plea directed to Him and so just as quickly looks on ahead to the next of the many many things potentially benefiting from His attention

And Do you pick that or god of sexually pleasing Keltham

WHY IS HE LIKE THIS 

That

Wrong answer

Just kidding its a fine answer

Has Carissa Sevar ever possibly heard the term sadist Its like the Baseline troll but less so

Having thus firmly established that sexuality questions dont need to be at all plausible How would Carissa feel if she was invited into a room and found Keltham negotiating with the Queen of Cheliax who has a minor crush on Carissa for him to rent Carissa to the Queen for a half day in exchange for five hundred gold pieces which Keltham gets to keep

Okay you know what Carissa needs some fun its true that all work and no play is bad for Evil people Ah yes the Queen of Cheliax who noticed me from uh the word Sevar probably having appeared in her briefing document twice

I will be genuinely surprised and disappointed with the extent of Governance interest in this project or for that matter their lack of awareness about the project that got them into a war with Nidal if the Queen of Cheliax does not by this point personally know your Intelligence your Worldwound record your learning metrics from wizard academy and the fact that when we left the Forbiddance together you were wearing an intelligence headband that hadnt gone through military checks

Right okay thats fair she probably has an entire page of sexy sexy performance reviews on me I would be stunned and impressed at your initiative and extremely confused and kneel very obediently for negotiations because if thats the kind of thing the Queen likes she would absolutely be taking notes on whether I was kneeling properly Im probably not the palace has all kinds of rules for things like that

The Queen is a much more experienced sadist than I am Feeling insecure about whether she could successfully steal you from me I insist on negotiating a term in our agreement saying that if your affections shift too far from me towards her Im legally entitled to walk out on any current project obligations and take you with me whether you like that or not to a country thats okay with my owning you like I own my shirt The idea being that in this way Carissa Sevar never thinks in her heart that maybe the Queen has more real power over her than Keltham does

Keltham deserves to see the face she made privately when he first came up with this plan even though her feelings are mostly all dead now 

Not to fight this incredibly hot hypothetical too much but if the Queen wanted to keep me against my will she knows how and you dont It takes some work with wizards and even the places that would agree that you own me like you own your shirt wouldnt be able to help you find me if I summoned a horse made out of mist in the night and ran away Is she making it obvious enough that her desired reaction here is not well obviously Id let you go then

Keltham entirely fails to take conscious note of this minor shift of ethical premises because he is a dath ilani boyfriend who has been handed a Problem to Solve Ive still got whatever pay Ive accumulated from Governance and the contract gives me enough time while Security holds you prisoner that I can look up whatever solutions are standard and deploy them on you

See this is going exactly how Carissa planned except for the thing where Abrogail is furious with her and if it continues to go exactly as planned Abrogail will work out her frustrations eventually I think the standard solution is to make them use all their spells and take their spellbook which works on the ninety eight percent of wizards who dont have high enough Spellcraft to eventually learn how to scaffold without any special inks for structure I do not think the standard solution is the one that the Queen of Cheliax would be using if we are surmising that she read my records

I mean the notion isnt that Im taking the Queen head on in a contest of wills and powers the notion is that I cheated and got her signed agreement to lose to me before the contest started I dont have to hold hypothetical Carissa better than the Queen could I just have to hold her so she cant get back to the Queen

But actually our story doesnt get this far The Queen of Cheliax mysteriously refuses to sign off on this absolutely and totally reasonable request I am making of her despite Contessa Lrilatha and all of her other advisors telling her how absolutely and totally reasonable it is I break off negotiations and inform you that the Queen of Cheliax is a living manifestation of the same phenomenon that sent Pilar to Elysium a belief further updated when it turns out that Asmodia started being able to see peoples thoughts after she came back from Hell and now we all have no choice but to flee back to our new project home I tell you that you are firmly forbidden from ever again meeting with the Queen of Cheliax no matter how hot she is or how much your thoughts turn to all the scary things she could do to you because everybody has a job to do and I dont want any more plot complications we can possibly delay or avoid What is your estimate of the effect this entire series of events would have on our relationship

 Asmodia can what now Uh being tangentially present for palace romantic drama and being ordered to stay away from the Queen at all costs sounds hot but I feel like honestly in this situation my sexual feelings are mostly taking a back seat to my trying to figure out what the fuck phenomenon is messing with our project and how to kill it

Correct Carissa Very correct

Some further sexual hypotheticals follow Keltham then says theyve done enough of those on net hes feeling pretty reassured about some things and excuses himself momentarily to dispatch a message to Isidre

His oblivious girlfriend will hang innocently out on his bed

She is very oblivious and innocent Carissa not having any idea whats shes about to walk into does make Keltham feel rather supervillainish to the point where he has to fight back his conscience questioning whether Civilization would really honestly approve of all this

Carissa has been very very loud about wanting him to try more things in the cuddleroom wanting him to take more risks he checked under suddenly truthspell if she really believed he could trust what she was saying and she did They have known each other for three whole days now and its time to move forward on ambitious third date activities like negotiating fallback ownership options on her so that he can safely rent her to the Queen of Cheliax as a romantic surprise If he cant do even that much their relationship is hopeless

Dath ilan spends a great deal of money and energy trying to prevent its overly smart people from getting bored by a life that is far less complicated than the most complicated life their brains could handle

So far in Kelthams experience Golarion is doing legitimately better at this Credit where its due

Keltham pounces on his oblivious girlfriend and kisses her and hurts her as best he can without using any tools squicking himself out or being the Queen of Cheliax

They are not going to advance all the way to sex though Keltham has further work ahead of him this evening and frankly he is not sure he can make it through all that if he is not sufficiently horny to remember why hes trying He does moderately expect that if things go well enough he can get fairly thoroughly laid afterwards

His oblivious girlfriend is very satisfying to hurt and very attracted to him and gives no indication that she is bored of this and wants a more experienced sadist such as the Queen of Cheliax 

She doesnt

There are some sights you see very rarely in Golarion like a nude beach full of sunbathing drow or a gnome and a ninja patiently feeding seaweed snacks to a dragon who is presently a hamster but which keeps flash freezing them when it sneezes or a mouse the size of a building smashing through to and then pooping in the innermost sanctum of the ancient imperial line of Minkai or a pepper grenade roadside stand doing brisk business in the middle of the great desert an overwrought and glittery temple of Iomedae or a paladin on a shoplifting spree

You do see them a bit more in Golarion than in other places though

There are some sights you see very rarely in Golarion and one of those sights is the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus clutching a sheaf of parchments and laughing so hard there are tears in her eyes and shes having to physically lean against the wall and is probably going to hit herself with Lesser Restoration when this is over to make up for how much she isnt breathing and all of these paroxysms are making her stomach physically hurt but none of this matters because Aspexia Rugatonn has now reached the part where Keltham is completely innocently explaining to the Queen of Cheliax that if she doesnt act like a fucking sane person for once in her entire life she will be either unceremoniously removed from the throne or forced to become his girlfriend

That might not be such a bad idea actually Though not in that sense of course

Its just that Keltham for all his headstrongness his errors his delusions his total spoilation and lack of discipline bestowed by his Lawful Good societys insanely permissive upbringing still in other ways radiates a powerful impression that well That he could not only understand Aspexias notion of corrigibility after three minutes of explanation but would possibly even invent it all himself the moment he understood what Asmodeuss own problems were like as seen from His perspective

They have no idea what dath ilani halfbloods will be like at this point But depending on how they turn out if they can keep half of all that Law and be raised also Evil its plausible that the Church of Asmodeus would really really and by Church of Asmodeus Aspexia Rugatonn here means Aspexia Rugatonn really really really want somebody on the throne of Cheliax who could understand the concept of corrigibility

Abrogail Thrune IIs compact with Asmodeus says that while she can bear any number of potential heirs to men of her own choosing the Church may twice ask of her a father of the Churchs own choosing As for who inherits that is something that only a compact with Asmodeus can decide

The Church hasnt asked that of Abrogail so far because theres been no candidate that would be worth the amount of fuss theyd get Abrogails compact says that she needs to do it but the incompetent devil who framed that compact unfortunately did not specify that Abrogail needed to act professional about receiving such a request Rather a massive oversight as it turned out among many others So far Abrogail has borne no children at all but this is not a national problem there are other Thrunes who could compact with Asmodeus

Aspexia Rugatonn will have to seriously consider whether she wants to actually do this or just threaten to do it in order to witness the look on Abrogails face Those are the only two options to be clear there is no third

But first shes going to finish reading

Keltham receives notice that he has an Important Meeting in 10 minutes He thanks the messenger closes the door checks his new pocketwatch to establish the time and goes back to being mean to Carissa for the next 8 minutes

This to be clear is less notice than you usually give a Chelish citizen for a royal audience they will probably want to get dressed or write out a testament or some such But Abrogail Thrune does have any grasp of what Keltham hasnt the tiniest inkling about and she does not particularly want to spend any additional time receiving him on an impressive throne As in not one single additional minute

Bye Carissa sorry for all this going back and forth but this is hopefully Kelthams last meeting set of the day Hell probably be like at least thirty minutes this would be a good time for Carissa to spend some time decompressing from the whole Security thing and getting in some alone time for herself Though to be clear thats not a command its just an idea

The idea will be taken into account

Carissa could in fact use some time to herself but does Abrogail want her for this

Theres no Security showing up to escort her anywhere in particular

Cool Then shes going to snuggle under Kelthams covers and 

 if youd told her two days ago that by the end of the third day shed have Keltham demanding of Cheliax the legal right to take Carissa with him against her will anywhere he pleases and reluctant to leave Cheliax because of being hunted by Kuthites while Cheliax conquered Nidal using diamonds Otolmens gave their project shed be delighted

She isnt but thats because the torture seems to have burned out more feelings than just the inconvenient one She wonders if Contessa Lrilatha ever has any feelings at all

Within the center of Egorians Imperial Palace is a tiny park lit by magically artificial sunlight with a brook of clear water that flows from nowhere to nowhere It doesnt see much use Cheliax doesnt often receive visitors so naive as to be moved even subconsciously by the implication that this is where some Thrune likes to spend their spare time

Abrogail Thrune II now in her true outer form is wearing royal robes much simpler than those she usually wears and sitting in a simpler chair than the Throne of Cheliax Shes flicking breadcrumbs to the fish that spend their whole lives confined to this artificial brook

As much as Abrogail is annoyed by other aspects of the affair including the manner in which she was the author of her own destruction shes never going to get a chance to do this again in her entire life and have somebody actually buy it So yes shes feeding breadcrumbs to the fish

Keltham having left his escort behind a few steps ago steps into the tiny park and gives an approving nod like much of the Imperial Palace this place seems acceptably pretty for a civilized society

The Queen of Cheliax is superstimulus level hot the same way as Contessa Lrilatha but much more dangerously so on account of looking human Keltham is glad that he knows that magical beauty treatments exist is that why the plot point of Carissa getting one because otherwise his ero route trope alarms would be blaring even louder It makes perfect sense that the Queen of Cheliax is absurdly hot of course she is shed be able to afford it in a society with the economicmagic for that its not at all inevitably the case that shes going to try to steal Carissa or that one way or another the two of them will end up fucking no matter how contrived the reason no not at all

She also looks tired Exhausted even

Sorry about this Keltham says apologetically as he comes over to sit in the chair left next to the Queens own chair which is exactly as fancy as hers I realize youre probably pretty busy Exhausted even

Dont be too sorry This is less stressful than what I was doing before I came here So gently says the tired Queen of Cheliax Abrogail who while not dangerously Good like Isidre also has overly large problems and a headband too much more powerful than anyone elses So youre the boy whos caused all this trouble hm

Cant quite tell if that was a joke across the cultural gap If not theres a difference between setting off trouble and intending to create it Though the same proverb also says that making people any less responsible than responsible for all the effects of all their actions can create dangerous loopholes in things but I think for a case like this one some of that distinction matters

It was a joke Mostly There may have been an edge to it now that I think about it When war begins there is a certain urge to look around and find somebody near to hand to blame

If Dou Bral originally cooperated to seal Rovagug Zon Kuthon probably was pretty close to being dissatisfied enough with the state of the world that hed prefer to destroy it Anything that brought hope into this world anything at all would have set him off

Abrogail smiles with real humor At least its going to look like real humor to Keltham unless he has suddenly acquired rather an extreme number of ranks in Perception or Sense Motive

I admire your ability to describe yourself as that which brings hope into the world Most boys your age would probably be a little embarrassed to talk about themselves that way

Keltham is confused by this I wouldve put more maybes and qualifiers around it and called it more of a personal belief state than a public one before Zon Kuthon went straight for me and had to be sealed away by the other gods Youve enough evidence now to know that the advertisement is certified accurate

A sigh but still a humorous one I was teasing or trying to I suppose it didnt make it across the what did you call it cultural gap

Keltham associates that kind of apparent mating value lowering teasing with Complicated Flirting where youre maneuvering for relative advantage if you actually end up in a relationship Keltham was really hoping that was not going on here

Time for a quick change of subject Dont suppose youve got your own plans for a meeting agenda Hed usually whiteboard it but the park has nothing to write on let alone writing materials

By Kelthams thoughts he truly doesnt have the concept of the thing that a royal monarch is in the true Golarion If he had his writing surfaces about him hed blithely write out his agenda

If one of those agenda items was causing the downfall of another god hed treat it no differently than any other Gods to Keltham are things to be coordinated with and if they dont coordinate they have to be put down first temporarily by other gods and then permanently by the eventual Civilization that Zon Kuthon feared and that Keltham sees an opportunity to build

Hes stranger and maybe a tiny bit scarier when he thinks about matters on a larger scale than his woman Carissa Finding himself in a world with gods is no different to him from finding himself in a world with fish they are both just ordinary real things to him once he knows they exist

Abrogail can see or maybe not see but she can imagine why Otolmens might be concerned

I suppose Id be remiss if I didnt at least ask what you intend to bring into Cheliax and Golarion next though that discussion may need to be cut short if we are to discuss everything on our agenda

She would in fact be remiss this is something she wants to read Kelthams mind about

For some reason it hadnt occurred to Keltham that he ought to polish his elevator pitch before talking to this venture capitalist Oh silly him thats probably what the 10 minutes were for

Not much worries though Keltham has substantially higher verbal facility than youd expect from a random Golarion bloke with Intelligence 18 just like he has higher Wisdom than youd expect of a random boy his age with Intelligence 18

Keltham will spend the next five minutes extemporizing an elevator pitch on Civilization the nice things that it has and how while theres lots of specific nice things the much more important thing is going into an attractor made out of harmonizing bits of Law that lets you start figuring out those things yourself Now and then though Keltham quite visibly to either Abrogail hesitates to mention some unknown thing and then says something else instead

From reading Kelthams mind Abrogail now knows in admittedly not much detail at all that greater fire and other scalable weapons are a thing and theres some sort of stuff called that Keltham worries he should just never mention to anyone in case Prestidigitation can flip ordinary materials into it Except it is the sort of thing you figure out inevitably given enough knowledge so if theres any spell below Wish that does it maybe physics past the level is much more infohazardous in Golarion Still Kelthams thoughts are totally confident in the ability of a grownup and Lawful Civilization to handle that sort of thing his Civilization didnt blink about putting the entire past under a screen when they encountered some unknown thing that really needed to be screened off

Shes obviously not going to talk about this with anyone not even Rugatonn or Lrilatha or Gorthoklek except in the most abstract terms She doesnt want all the diamonds in Cheliax teleported to Lastwall

Is Asmodeus sure that He knows what Hes doing

But then Abrogail would run a pretty high risk of destroying all of Golarion let alone just Cheliax before she risked not letting her senior partner have His own fun and so betraying Him in the depths of her own heart So until she gets different orders shes going to stick with these Worst case the world gets destroyed and needs to be rebuilt by the gods its not like you can destroy Hell that way she doesnt think

And what would you of us in return then Non binding negotiations

Keltham explained the Law of this to his class yesterday before Zon Kuthon attacked sorry Keltham didnt mean to suggest there was a causal connection to that Law in particular being told Keltham considers the starting point for negotiations given that Law to be pretty straightforward He does want it clear that this is not his opening offer in a Golarion style illegible negotiation meant to be bargained down but if shes read the full class transcript with that incredibly fancy headband the Queen will know all about that

Kelthams private thoughts Exactly the same as what he says aloud there is no dishonesty in him no dishonesty at all when it comes to trade Thats not because hes nice but because he knows what fairness is and will not lightly brook any departure from it whether by himself or any other In that sense if in very few others this young man could pass as an ordinary cleric of Abadar

I think this may have already been mentioned to you but Cheliax is not easily set up to measure great gains in productivity and tax away half of it to you

Its admirably Evil and would probably count in Pharasmas sight too though its pretty obvious Keltham doesnt realize that the wealth he takes away would starve some number of orphans that would otherwise have lived had those taxes been less Maybe even if he knew hed shrug and say that it was still fewer total orphans than wouldve starved if Keltham had never come to Cheliax its not Abrogails read on him though

Thing needs to get done one way or another but if somebodys got to lose I see no particular reason it needs to be me or rather why I need to lose more than my Lawful and fair share If Governance has problems with basic capacities show those to me and I might agree in the end that its not possible to do better in Golarion and some deal needs to happen anyways But at that point with truly huge quantities of wealth at stake yeah if its not the straightforward division of gains under Law I might start throwing around truthspells the fairness spell and cap it off with a single oath that nobody messed with those spells

I need to cut a deal with somebody yeah but somebody also needs to cut a deal with me You would ordinarily expect that if there was just the one of me and several possible countries to deal with that the person in shorter supply of themselves would have the upper hand in negotiations Cheliax looks to be the best of them at the moment but it does need to keep looking like that

What would you do with such vast wealth if it were yours

Invest it obviously What else would you do with more wealth than you can sanely spend on personal living expenses If Mad Investor Chaos didnt suspect that he was going to need to run all over Cheliax and Golarion frantically investing in 200 different projects to build pieces of Civilization he would be asking a smaller share of the gains

Kelthams thoughts show sincerity of course hes a cleric of Abadar negotiating a trade deal with somebody who hasnt visibly betrayed him yet and some not especially Golarion comprehensible thoughts about logarithmic utility functions if youre spending money on yourself Abrogail does know what a logarithm is but the connection in Kelthams thoughts is not clear

If you were willing to take some of your share of the gains in a public investment fund that stayed in Cheliax it would potentially simplify some political problems for us And also probably be the sort of thing thats much easier to contractually yoink if Keltham tries to leave

Abrogail does have some thoughts about how Kelthams gains if he tries to leave could be made payable to him in the standard backing of value for Chelish currency The trouble is that gets caught by that incredibly audacious clause he innocently dared to offer Lrilatha about avoiding terms expected to have unexpected unpleasant consequences If Kelthams departure leaves behind most of his gains in the form of a Cheliax only investment fund if they can get away with including that clear and understood term it might save Cheliax quite a lot of loss

I suppose Im open to so encumbering some of the gains with spending restrictions if thats really helpful for some reason but in general I expect the next stage is making lots of investments outside Cheliax and also I currently trust my ability to pick investments more than no thats not quite right Chelish Governance can already be expected to run around making the investments in Cheliax obvious to Chelish Governance I am concerned about reserving the power to run around patching the holes and fixing whats left and I do want that power as unencumbered as possible

Mm Abrogail says softly She tosses some more breadcrumbs to the fish I think you will be sadly surprised in some of the ways you have been sadly surprised before at what strange things are more or less politically feasible in Golarion It is full of encumbrances both on money and on other things What you think is reasonable what is in fact reasonable under Law may not be something that even the Queen of Cheliax could give if she tried her hardest I say this not to pressure you in negotiations it is just a world you do not seem to quite yet understand

Understood The problem being it would be good to cut a deal soon and get started on some things and to wait for me to understand more things comes with that as a delay

You could try showing me what you thought was a totally sane and reasonable deal for somebody who actually understood Golarion and see how loudly I screamed Maybe I wouldnt scream very loudly at all and then wed have a deal

Heh What a friendly cleric of Abadar this is Perhaps we shall try that then

It can always be said not to have come from Lrilatha and if Keltham tries to add a no gotchas clause he can be told that this does require Lrilatha to rewrite the whole thing

I think we should perhaps move on to our other how did you put it agenda item

I have been getting to know you some by these interactions they werent wasted even from the thirstiest most money uncaring standpoint

He really has no concept that corresponds to what a Queen is I am given to understand that Isidre has meddled I think would be the term Id use here Contrary to what some of my advisors seem to think I never had any intention of taking Carissa Sevar away from you It would have been really quite incredibly stupid

Keltham is somewhat reassured Somewhat I am a little worried that you would have ended up doing it quite by accident For the same reason that Pilar went to Elysium and Ione foretells Nidal attacks Well the same reason according to one particular try by me at interpreting and predicting events which could very easily be absolutely and entirely wrong but has been making a couple of successful predictions lately The same prediction would say that we would somehow end up fighting over Carissa no matter how much that made absolutely no sense in the middle of a war It is rather a weird and complicated reason to try to explain

Yes tropes Isidre told me little of them and less sense than that I think I do not want any tropes anywhere near Cheliax That is most of what I desire for myself in this No tropes Tropes be gone Not for the good of Cheliax even so much as that I dont want to live my life like that

All right maybe Isidre didnt oversell how totally sensible of a person you were Keltham says out loud like this is a completely normal and sane thing to say to the Queen of Cheliax

Abrogail of course is only gently amused she knows the Outsider is ignorant Let us all pray to Asmodeus that it is so and continues to be so

I cant guarantee that anything we can do here can keep the tropes out of Cheliax Assuming they exist like literally at all Taking steps to defuse every hint of future possible conflict complication and open questions about Carissa Sevar between us may heavily act to minimize whether any tropes are going to start hanging around you personally and not just Pilar or Ione or Carissa or myself Assuming again that tropes are even a thing

I hadnt previously thought us especially likely to get into a conflict over Carissa Sevar in the first place but yes if theres a threat to myself here I am interested in minimizing it Abrogail is not that Good and is allowed to say such things

Its possible I shouldnt poke at this but you dont think the simplest solution is just to find somebody else

I think you overestimate how often I find someone I am actually interested in at all Abrogail says softly A butterfly lands on her hand where it rests on her chairs arm and she lowers her head and gently blows to shoo it away Maybe Carissa Sevar would be as common as iron in dath ilan here she is gold You picked her up too easily to appreciate what you now hold in your hands I think

Id still walk entirely away from Carissa Sevar if that was the cost of a trope free life I am just worried that walking away is not the correct way to prove that a trope can have no existence A compact between us ensuring that I cannot possibly end up with Sevar under any circumstances and my then having my fun with her and putting it behind me seems possibly wiser Possibly You would probably know better than I

That question has occurred to me as well several times I hope I dont end up regretting it a lot when I say that I really have absolutely no clue which of those two courses of action is the better one and we might as well take the one thats more fun if we are otherwise determined to both be as extremely sensible as we can about it all

Abrogail laughs somewhat to her surprise its her real selfs laugh as well Yes that is the reason behind the decision isnt it Abrogail can offer no better logic of her own

Then Shall we set our terms over Carissa Sevar

Im not quite sure about any of this but I think were supposed to do that in front of Carissa possibly even if were not fighting it out It may not be a matter of winning if were not fighting but its the process that decides who controls her and that open question in her mind should be resolved to close out the reaction binding site target shape that a trope might hook itself into at least if Carissa can act as a viewpoint character thing that a trope thinks has questions

Also that would be more romantic according to intuitions I now apparently have

Also also I need Isidre to write some of the terms and then not look at them myself

Also also also there is a chance that something goes weirdly wrong during the negotiation and then while they are all probably doomed they may still be less doomed if Isidre and Lrilatha are right there

Also also also also if Carissa suddenly realizes shes terribly wrong about what she finds hot she should maybe be like someplace she can say that before its too late but this cannot and need not be thought because it exceeds the maximum also stack depth plus its too obvious

Any sane person would at this point suggest that the real bargaining happen between themselves and that they just play it out again for Carissa once the outcome has been predetermined and they know their parts in the play but that Abrogail suspects or Abrogail for that matter is far too terribly dishonest for a dath ilani

 good luck Sevar thinks Abrogail but then Sevars had enough unexpected luck already that Asmodeuss hand there is clear

Mm That does present a let us not say complication Doing this in front of Carissa instead of simply presenting her with a sealed agreement between us presents us with a matter of something that you gain and something that I lose What you gain is her affection what I lose is something that I worry a dath ilani may not understand It has to do with Asmodeuss domain of pride which being something that belongs to a god is not intrinsically defined in mortal terms but in mortal terms maybe I could say that I have a reputation for winning and that you want me to do something that could be seen as losing Not in private between ourselves but where others like Carissa or for that matter Isidre can see it

I suspect translation difficulties around the word Is it like the pleasure that you get from being a better player of your favorite game than most people around you visibly and in a way you can prove to them

If pity was something that Abrogail Thrune went about feeling she knows she would be feeling it now Abrogail feels it therefore That is something like what I might expect to remain in a society that had gone much much much too far in the direction of Good after theyd taken something deep and real in human nature and flattened it down into a small sad remnant they deemed acceptable

Right well is it something like killing all the players of the game who are better than you so that you can be the best one left alive

Keltham supposes this is a thing you can trade a sufficiently large heap of dead bodies for exact size of heap depending on initial talent and practice Though to Keltham himself it seems like this is completely missing the point of what dath ilan and yes he thinks is the meaning of pride in playing a game well and visibly better than others It proves youre adequate at the murder game but the other gameplayers werent even trying to compete with you in that

That is what I would expect an overly Good society to tell its children was what happened if they let themselves feel any real pride And they wouldnt be wrong per se but still theres more to it than that

It is sometimes hard to explain things like this to me though I want to understand them all eventually and your time is valuable I dont know if we want to go down that conversational subtree they have no word for subtree how the ass do you convey subtree in Taldane Thing you can go down What are the consequences

We do this in a manner that looks less like you winning and my losing that looks less like things are taken from me and you are taking them by being greater and mightier in your own person than the Queen of Cheliax To the extent we cannot do that or you do not wish to you offer me something I value in return I am more open than many rulers would be to the latter course because most of the real pride trampling has already occurred at this point and she may as well get paid for it

Not that Keltham has very much he can trade that could possibly be worth as much as Abrogail Thrune has already lost of her pride to this stripling If he ever stops being valuable to Cheliax and Asmodeus withdraws His protection she has more than a curious interest now in seeing what happens to dath ilani as they are slowly broken

If Carissa was something that had a normal price I would offer you ten percent discount on her but I dont know if that still works for sex things that arent really about the money

Where does she start

It doesnt work for sex things no and your suggestion sounded incredibly strange for Golarion You should at some point tell Sevar about what you said there and have her explain things to you So Abrogail can read the transcripts of Carissas thoughts when she hears

Among other things did I not know you for something that is from further beyond our world than ordinary outsiders it would be something you should not say to suggest that any part of the Queens pride is worth only that much money

Carissa herself being rented is worth something to you if this were a real price in money that amount would be either set to balance supply and demand or else her real value to you would be somewhere around twice what you were paying me assuming that renting her cost me nothing significant If you lose something in pride that is nonetheless less important to you than what you gain by having Carissa it decreases your total gains from the trade Which doesnt matter if its a supply and demand balance Id just sell to somebody else But if its a non market fair division problem then losing something in the course of gaining Carissas rental decreases the fair price to you of her rental hence the discount

The Law is straightforward if its actually about the money I dont know what were supposed to do if its a sex thing Do you have a suggestion in mind

In truth I am not clear on what I could ask from you at this point which would be appropriate Most of the things that are wanted from you are things that Cheliax wants not that I want and it is I and not Cheliax who loses here You could agree that you owed me a future favor appropriate to the real cost to me of my lost pride in this matter it requires some trust from me to you that you will repay but no more trust than you are already being given in some ways

Say the key words as if they mean nothing make sure to add some more distracting words later hope he is that naive and does not know to be wary of Asmodeans bearing bargains 

Lady I mean you sort of are the person who gets to rent Carissa in the first place here And the sexy price that was suggested to me by Isidre did not strike me as being in the range of what that is actually worth to you the value you gain from it given that its worth this much of your time at all and given what I expect your finances are like

I am doing this because it will supposedly I hope be good for Carissa because I think it will impress my girlfriend and because I want fewer tropes messing with me And since thats an adequate reason for me to do it and this is all a sex thing in the first place and we are all hopefully friends here and also probably really because I am still thinking of this as somebody else having sex with Carissa only it has to be done in a way that makes my brain shut up about it 

For all of those reasons I havent asked you for anything like what the Queen of Cheliax can afford to pay for anything thats worth her time at all or asked you to explicitly owe me a favor afterwards

 uh I hope were not starting to have a real conflict here where were contesting negotiating abilities or something If were starting to have a real conflict that calls into question who gets to have Carissa or whether this agreement takes place at all then it should happen in front of Carissa for trope reasons And Lrilatha and Isidre should be there

 one addresses the Queen of Cheliax as Your Majesty not Lady to be clear Even Abrogail says this albeit she does not say it as sharply as Abrogail Thrune would wave someone off to torture execution

It would figure that in Abadars World they are not as naive about bargaining as about some things But he still Abrogail hopes does not realize the game he is really playing or how deadly it can be to him in an Asmodean country

I hadnt hoped that would be an irreconcilable point of conflict no says Abrogail She shrugs Your point is a very fair one and I should have seen it myself my apologies for that I suppose it could be something like I agree to owe you a favor proportional to how much I really gain from sex with Sevar and you owe me a favor proportional to the real cost to me in lost pride of how you got to look impressive in front of Sevar while negotiating that

Its considered ill practice where I come from to take on debts with no legible caps on their objective magnitude unless youre creating a child in which case you dont have a choice and somebodys got to do that sometimes I suppose that since the real cost and real value are being assessed by reference to your own values you could feel safe with that Though for edge case coverage reasons Id want the explicit understanding that the favor you owe me is greater than the favor I owe you say by a factor of at least two that they are positive in sign and that the two can potentially be partially cancelled against each other

 is she not going to win this one It seems so

Did she doom herself to tropehood by that not happening in front of Sevar She doesnt think so that was a duel between herself and Keltham and not one that was really over possession of Carissa at all

Well Perhaps Sevars thought was correct perhaps everyone but her underestimates Keltham he is doing better than she expected even now But at least to Abrogail it seems like Keltham does flirt very close to the edges of losing his games and damning himself in one sense or another He just needs to be encouraged to go on playing them

The Queen sighs I suppose we could have it be the kind of favors owed that are understood not to be enforceable even in the eyes of Asmodeus I am a little friendlier to you for borrowing Sevar you are a little friendlier to me for making you look good in front of her

Maybe what I really want is the acknowledgement that my pride has any value at all in this Especially since as an outsider from a world lost completely to Good you may not see or realize or understand the Evil thing that you are trampling on and perhaps also trample on it excessively

That is very much something I would prefer not to do I acknowledge explicitly your pride is valuable even the shadow dath ilan still has would be valuable if maybe less so Let no value be destroyed that need not be destroyed

Hed add that Civilization is not that lost to Good like seriously lady your majesty but who knows maybe from her perspective it is that lost just like Golarion from his perspective lacks almost any trace of Law

Is there anything helpful that can be told to the outsider to prevent his unintended rampage of value destruction

It is far far far too late unfortunately Abrogail will nonetheless try to explain the concept of how to treat royalty deferentially and that the meeting shes currently having is in fact one where if she was having it with a Chelish citizen it would be incognito meaning that she is pretending not to be the Queen still Abrogail Thrune but not the Queen meaning that Keltham is allowed to sit in her presence instead of stand and she does not need a much fancier chair to protect the dignity of Cheliax

They do it in Taldor

 is she trolling him

She isnt She shouldnt even try to explain all of this on the Queens expensive time after this Keltham can get an emergency one hour lesson in how to interact with a non incognito Queen without that being an Incident if it happens in front of her advisors He can think of things he might need to say and memorize how to say them in the more formal interaction and hopefully enough of that will let him improvise around the edges if necessary Even then if he suddenly hears Isidres voice magically whispering in his ear he needs to immediately pause whatever hes doing and listen and not argue

This will give Carissa Sevar slightly more time to recover since it has by now been reported to Abrogail the cute little idiot went and submitted herself to her any time in three days torture session right away without making sure it happened sometime when shed have an hour or two to herself to recover afterward Was Sevar that stupid that overconfident of her recovery ability or had she just never previously gotten herself in important project screwup mentally insubordinate to the Queen levels of trouble Probably all three

It is infuriating that the child has gotten herself into a vital position where she needs to be accommodated for incompetence like that rather than it being turned into a more object lesson But theyre planning to try out Lrilatha running Suggestion on Keltham and while that is expected to go well Sevar needs to be in better form to exploit whatever change Keltham has then in his thoughts

Keltham is disturbed by the implication that the Queen has any advisors who dont understand the reason why a sane person would just ignore all this hugely time costly crap

 its a not as Lawful as dath ilan thing You wouldnt understand

Does the Queen think this whole shenanigan is generating enough value that its worth spending an hour of Kelthams valuable time on trying to load and shortly afterwards forget all this shit Or is this knowledge in some other way reusable and persistently valuable

 to be honest Abrogail does suspect that learning some completely pointless Golarion shit will be an important life experience for Keltham

If that sentence needed to be prefaced with to be honest does that mean all the previous sentences not so prefaced were possibly not honest

Its an expression meaning to reveal ones thoughts rather than concealing them or to reveal the whole thought rather than concealing some of it you might otherwise be tempted to conceal This was the meaning Abrogail had in mind

Or yes in Golarion to tell the truth where one might otherwise lie In many of the common scenarios where of course the other person would expect you to lie but maybe not if you said to be honest in a serious sounding voice first

That really doesnt make any 

You need to talk about this with Sevar Keltham not me

Yes Sorry

Is Keltham ready for his etiquette lesson

Abrogail Thrune is enjoying how much his thoughts are dreading this Its not much at all but at least she gets to torture him a little

Are they done here Keltham asks himself He didnt get a chance to talk about well whats actually going to happen to Carissa Which Keltham apparently needs to treat as an infohazard for probably like at least a month or something

Unfortunately Keltham came into this conversation with a clear goal namely get his brain into a position to decide whether it was comfortable renting Carissa to the Queen but with no real idea of how to accomplish that goal

 internal interrogation suggests that on the one hand their overt interactions have not been very sexy doesnt really create any relationship where Keltham rents Carissa to her oh In retrospect maybe thats what the Complicated Flirting was about it was just that Keltham was much more worried when that happened about the Queen possibly trying to open her eroLARP route at him so he shut it down He was probably not supposed to do that

Still that the Queen flirted hopefully just pseudo flirted at him at all is an acknowledgement of Keltham as a sexual romantic relationship having thing and that is possibly enough for whatever weird thing is inside him Keltham does not understand the rules at all Well its enough provided that the Queen is in fact incredibly hot which she is

But maybe add safety margin Why do something your brain just barely approves of when you could do not that

I think the dath ilani thing to do in this situation if it could manage to come up in dath ilan is that we both tell each other a mildly embarrassing naughty story from our early sexual experiences in a way meant to acknowledge that the other persons story is sexy and funny and then we have a relationship that is not just about project management or trope avoidance and my brain is more confident that I can rent Carissa to you

Yes fine Abrogail Thrune just wants to be done with this and send Keltham off to his torture session Even Abrogail wants to be done with this though shes not showing it of course

Abrogail tells a somewhat funny mildly sexy story that could plausibly have happened to a teenage royal in Taldor before she took over the country

Keltham will not ask a number of large looming questions

Keltham will tell her about that time when he and his carefully spoiler protected fellows were just figuring things out and Keltham got to be the one who figured out that if a certain girl wasnt sure shed ever had an orgasm that almost certainly meant shed never had one She then grimly resolved to keep up with her age cohort and get it done within the next hour not even as a trading pleasures thing just get it done and Keltham got very determined about helping her with this clearly established Goal and those mental postures as they would realize at a future point in their lives were not the most helpful possible mental postures they could have taken

Dath ilan definitely is a place

The Queens chuckles and smiles will read to almost anyone in Golarion as genuine if theyre stupid enough to trust whatever reading skills theyre opposing to the Queen of Cheliax

Did that help Keltham isnt sure The Queen seems too old too Very Serious if he shuts his eyes his brain doesnt really understand what she would do with Carissa If he opens his eyes again and thinks about how the Queen is incredibly hot frankly that seems to be doing practically all the work here combined with the earlier flirting

But he tried the obvious thing and their time is not infinite his brain is hesitant about the rental but not saying no and its time to proceed with the plan

Okay you know what hes just going to do this it cant be that bad its just an hour of hearing about absolutely insane nonsense whose very existence is somehow opposed to his own fundamental nature in every way but without that being legible enough to explicitly fight back against and if he can do that for a minute he can do it for an hour

Keltham departs for etiquette lessons

 that was strangely satisfying in the way of finally having somebody fall into your power whom it had previously been unreasonably difficult to torture Is it trivial Absolutely But he doesnt know that he has absolutely no clue and somehow that makes it work

Maybe she can find future excuses why Keltham definitely needs even more etiquette lessons Hed need them in Taldor

Maybe she can figure out what Keltham most hates about etiquette and design improved etiquette she does in fact have a country to run and needs to get back to running it literally now

Carissa does before she closes her eyes while lying in Kelthams bed contemplate whether itd be a disaster if she falls asleep A normal person would in fact either be annoyed or feel inclined to pretend to be if they came back to their fancy fancy room to find their girlfriend slave asleep in their bed but Keltham is an alien and wont even realize hes supposed to mind

Her next thought is about an hour later and its that she would have expected Keltham to be back by now She sits up

Theres a piece of chocolate cake on a plate next to her It looks a lot like the piece of cake that Pilar tried to give her yesterday morning No sign of Pilar herself

Has Chaotic Good considered doing things that arent stupid 

There are starving children in other countries she tells the empty room

She eats the cake Its pretty good

Message from Security Keltham got put in a delay loop while you recovered from your stupid fucking incompetence in taking an optional time torture session at a point where you still had work to do later Can the Queen of Cheliax and a number of other important people now be notified that youll be ready to be surprised to see them shortly

Unlike taking it at some other time when she wouldnt still have work to do later not at work sure does describe uh about ten minutes of her last three days They engineered a lie they dont have an infinite reserve of to excuse her absence and wouldve needed to engineer another

Its the wrong thought and she tucks it away quickly the primary point of the punishment was that her superiors are better than her have more experience operating under these conditions and are absolutely competent to handle them and that she is wrong when she thinks shes right and theyre mistaken If they think she shouldve manufactured another excuse some other time then theyre right even if she doesnt see why 

Anyway yes they can so be notified and couldve been notified an hour ago Carissa is fine

Security is personally of the opinion that sometime in the next three days Sevar would have managed to find a time when the Queen of Cheliax wasnt waiting on her or you know maybe just Abrogail Thrune II and not also the second third and fourth most powerful people in Cheliax too

He doesnt send this to Sevar but he does voice it aloud as commentary to the Security next to him

The Security next to him says hes not actually sure thats true Hes heard rumors about what life on Project Lawful is like Supposedly Maillol the project manager committed suicide and had to be tortured severely in Hell in order to get him to consent to being Raised and put back to work on it again

What did Keltham tell Carissa to do what should the naive Carissa understand to be going on right now

Sevar has been told to meet with Paracountess Isidre according to the story Keltham has received Keltham wanted to know why this wasnt lying he did seem fine going along with a technical truth after it was explained that Sevar would in fact meet Isidre and then the Queen shortly after Sevar having been told to dress for properly meeting with a Paracountess should show up wearing one of her nicer outfits but that should suffice

All right Shell dress up nicely enough to meet a Paracountess of House Thrune which isnt even that differently from how shed dress to meet the Queen since she doesnt actually have a further reservoir of even nicer clothes and do her hair accordingly and then be escorted wherever this is happening 

She feels a lot better even though she cant really understand why important people would have delayed their schedules to let her have a nap she did not need Well theyre smarter than her

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

 its over Is it over That was way longer than an hour Keltham stopped checking his pocketwatch after it became clear that it was obviously broken or tampered with but it wouldnt have been helpful anyways because it doesnt have a date function

He should not have set himself up to do anything this awful and then need to do anything else immediately after that Except that he needs to do this as quickly as possible before he forgets anything and needs an etiquette lesson again Carissas price is now 20 higher

When he gets out a palace Security is holding a piece of chocolate cake theyve been instructed to give him

Pilar is not having a great day here well actually its been literally the best day ever but not this particular hour and needs to keep grinding down the tiny bit of herself that wants to be in any way cheerful about having been assigned the servant labor of going around giving useless fucking pieces of cake to people

It is delicious cake and Keltham will eat it He has by his ass earned it

He does feel better afterwards Though really he could also use a nap but even if he is important enough to keep the Queen and her advisors waiting he would prefer not to do that and spend the informal political capital hes earning

Onward to his important meeting In which he will demand to Chelish Governance that they be prepared to deliver Sevar to him restrained and to be his owned object if she ever falls in love with the Queen of Cheliax

 was Isidre lying about the entire Carissa sex thing in order to make him look like a lunatic and sabotage him in front of the Queen and her advisors no that would make no sense because he asked Carissa and Carissa said it was hot so this should be something they recognize as a totally normal way of thinking and if not he will truthspell himself and then recount exactly what Isidre told him

To the Queens big fancy meeting room audience chamber It is time to unreasonably impress his girlfriend

Great balls of flaming poop that is one gaudy ass doompunk supervillain giant fancy meeting room

He doesnt say it out loud It wouldnt be etiquette

Also in the room is Isidre the giant alien from the Nidal attack Contessa Lrilatha in the armor that she apparently just wears a kindly looking old lady in a doompunk dress and the Queen of Cheliax on a truly massive chair that still looks completely ergonomically wrong despite obviously being the most expensive possible model of whatever brand of chair it is

Keltham properly kneels and bends his head to the Queen Everyone in this room except the actress playing Isidre can hear him thinking the dath ilani equivalent of Are we there yet

This isnt literally the best day of Aspexia Rugatonns life but it sure is up there

To Her Infernal Majestrix Abrogail Thrune the Second the Queen of Cheliax and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I present Keltham Lawful Evil outsider of the Lawful Good realm of dath ilan fourth circle cleric of a Lawful Neutral deity also enemy of Zon Kuthon now fallen and enlightener of Cheliax says the actress playing Isidre

Rise Keltham of dath ilan and approach the throne

Yeah he can do that part anyways

Hi Keltham blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah says the Queen of Cheliax

 is she deliberately dragging this out WHY

Oh probably Carissa is a minute late or something

Actually Carissas already here and waiting just outside but since Keltham has done her the helpful service of thinking of such an incredibly plausible excuse Abrogail will look apologetic and then keep talking

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 

ITS ANOTHER TIME LOOP OH NO HE JUST GOT OUT OF THE LAST ONE 

Oh good Isidre is leaving now presumably to meet Carissa and get her back hopefully that doesnt take too long

Actually is Carissa going to recognize the giant ass gaudy doompunk supervillain doors to the giant ass gaudy doompunk supervillain meeting room Hopefully not they dont exactly have cameras here so not everybody should know what the Queens meeting room looks like He does want to see the look on Carissas face

Isidre returns a moment later with Carissa at her side Announces her which absolutely no one in the room is paying any attention to

 even naive Carissa who would be experiencing the shock of her life right now wouldnt be so childish as to let it show on her face But Keltham is taking these baby steps into deeper Evil for her for the delight of seeing how she reacts and she wants to reward him for that she wants having power over people to be something that he finds endlessly thrilling And its not like it embeds everything else in a lie she can tell him afterwards that she would usually have tried to conceal her shock but didnt for him 

So

 and then once Keltham has been adequately rewarded she can get her facial expression properly under control and kneel and peek up at him with wide incredulous eyes She doesnt have Abrogails Splendour obviously but she did give herself a little boost before she came in and she thinks shes a very convincing provincial Taldane wizard girl at court for the first time

Gorthoklek is relaying Kelthams thoughts to Sevar in real time Keltham is thinking that all right the look on Carissas face makes even that horrible ass etiquette lesson completely worth it

Hes still charging the Queen an extra 20 for it though

Is that the delay loop they put Keltham in while she napped A slightly larger share of the bemused delight on Carissas face is genuine Poor Keltham 

Okay now they can actually do this shit right

Yes according to the personal opinion of Aspexia Rugatonn which she is making known to Abrogail by appropriate means

Fine yes she may as well get it over with and finish this humiliation

Keltham has heard that the Queen of Cheliax desires a thing that it is his to give or withhold

THAT IS NOT WHAT THE ETIQUETTE TEACHER SHOULD HAVE 

Aspexia This can only be Aspexias work

The Queen of Cheliax desires some part of the time of her subject Carissa Sevar in which to dally with her but this matter the Queen is given to understand Carissa Sevar has placed into the hands of Keltham along with all else that she is

It moves him actually and it moves him at least in part because all of this formality is speaking to some part of him in a voice that should ordinarily be reserved for wedding ceremonies and not Governance

Quick glance to see how Carissa is reacting to that

So incredibly expressively Keltham pulling this off would to naive Carissa seem like a fairly godlike feat of coincidence management and he deserves to feel that he has utterly transformed Carissas sense of what hes capable of And also that this is really sexy of him And also that her wildest fantasies are coming true which honestly they kind of are aside from how badly this is going to hurt once shes in fact alone with Abrogail fuck when did she get mentally into the habit of calling Her Imperial Majestrix Abrogail

Even taking into account that you know you have no idea still Carissa you have no idea

Blah blah blah blah blah blah six hundred gold pieces blah blah blah various additional terms and conditions apply and the Queen of Cheliax can take them or leave them Keltham says almost in the correct etiquette that an incredibly powerful outsider should in principle use to say such a thing politely to the Queen of Cheliax when handing her an ultimatum

His thoughts are clear on the point that this is what the etiquette teacher told him to do and he is obediently doing it

 it seems possible that Abrogail has in fact pissed off Aspexia Rugatonn slightly more than she previously realized over the last few days

Speak then your terms Keltham

blah blah blah x50 well basically the limits on what can be done to Carissa are going to be in a sealed section laid down on Kelthams behalf by Paracountess Isidre Thrune no sorry he cant remember all those middle names who does that to their kid hopefully this isnt too awful an error

And also Kelthams worried about Carissas heart being stolen away from him not least by her possible delusion that Carissas own person could possibly be taken away from him even by the Queen of Cheliax if Keltham himself had decided to get serious about keeping her so he now as indeed the greater part of his compensation for this rental demands that before he hands over Carissa the Queen sign such agreements as will duly incentivize her to attempt no such thing and ensure a correct outcome for her if she does If by untampered truthspell it is proven that Carissa has come to love the Queen and to love her more than she loves Keltham then Keltham has the right to walk out on all this shit not withstanding other bargains to be signed later and haul Carissas chained up ass away with him if he chooses

Carissa does not even have to pretend thats really hot because it just objectively is 

She does have to pretend at being surprised of course but she lets the surprise melt off as soon as is reasonable into just that thats really hot And she doesnt think Keltham has the subtlety to read this off her face but 

 but that she wants to know very badly if he means it and she wants him to mean it she wants to be in the power of someone capable of meaning it

Gorthoklek informs her that Keltham is continuing to struggle hard with reading the facial expressions of anyone who isnt a dath ilani and hes managed to pick up that Carissa is currently happy but not that she was trying to ask him a question or that this question had a particular desired answer

The first part of Kelthams request shes not dignifying it by calling it a demand is entirely acceptable The second part is a matter for Cheliax not the Queens dalliances Carissa Sevar is a citizen of this country and while she might be bargained away in some extremity she would not be bargained away lightly

Kelthams doing Cheliax a favor much larger than that

And is this then to be taken as partial repayment of that favor

Its to be taken as an unlikely conditional that the Queen needs to set up using her own political capital in order to fuck dally with Carissa When and if Keltham feels like formalizing his and Carissa Sevars relationship in the eyes of Cheliax maybe hell negotiate with Cheliax for Cheliaxs part in that but this current thing is not an unconditional outcome requiring an unconditional payment its about making it so that the Queen wouldnt be able to yoink her

Keltham is starting to stumble over his etiquette but is still gainfully trying

Though these requests be somewhat onerous the Queen will accede to them not least in the light of that favor which Keltham is indeed doing for Cheliax

For some reason the etiquette teacher made Keltham memorize this part very carefully Keltham does not really understand why he needs to negotiate with Governance like this but okay

Blah blah the Queens the one who insisted on dallying with Carissa Sevar in the first place knowing another had laid his claim to her and such suffering as that may incur to Her Infernal Majestrix is hers to own blah blah

YOUVE MADE YOUR POINT ASPEXIA

Has she Aspexia Rugatonn is still trying to decide

So be it then Abrogail Thrune does not wish Keltham of dath ilan outsider and enlightener of Cheliax to feel at all concerned that his Carissa Sevar would so be taken from him and indeed if they cost not Cheliax she is more than willing to add on other terms meant to ensure that Keltham need never fear any sort of conflict between him and the Queen over Carissas affection At all Ever

Blah blah sounds like a great idea is Contessa Lrilatha willing to do the honors of writing up this compact blah blah

blah blah Lrilatha is exceedingly willing to do her part to write stringent compact terms to ensure that Cheliaxs enlightener upon his project blessed by Asmodeus Himself shall not have his delicate affairs further and needlessly complicated by the Queen blah blah

Everyone in the room including Carissa on relay from Gorthoklek gets a ringside seat to Kelthams wince and mental wish that Lrilatha would chill Theyre trying to preserve the Queens pride here

Well Everyone in the room except the actress playing Isidre a first circle cleric of Asmodeus who has long since realized that the reason why somebody as relatively inexperienced as her was called in to serve as an impersonator at this Royal gathering is not that everyone else is fighting at the Nidal front but that theyre going to kill her when this is over Shes doing a great job of not showing any visible distress which would of course result in her being almost instantly Dominated and then dying much more painfully

Statue actually But obviously not one of the ones that gets warded against detection just one that gets tossed into her personal collection to stick around until after she dies Abrogail does not want this gossip spreading in Hell while shes alive

Carissa is not what you would call savvy in the nuances of the royal court but it has not escaped her that Keltham has managed to orchestrate an occasion for all of the Queens advisors to publicly mock her over her handling of the Carissa situation 

This is definitely bad for Carissa the only person who any involved party can permissibly torture which makes it hard to take any real enjoyment from but she can abstractly appreciate the skill

She is determinedly not thinking ahead to what Abrogail Her Imperial Majestrix is going to do to her that seems like the same kind of mistake as thinking about what Hell will be like Shell endure it when it comes and she wont get anything out of additionally enduring it in advance

Contracts written up quickly enough Yes Keltham you have Contessa Lrilathas word that it says what was discussed and contains no terms meant to be unexpected unpleasant surprises for Keltham

Keltham reads it carefully anyways of course

The Queen reads it much more carefully

Very standard language it wouldnt do to include anything hard for Abrogail to check that shed have to stop to consider and give away that such compacts are dangerous in front of Keltham

What the very standard language says is fuck you stop messing with Asmodeuss pet outsider unless the Church says you can She cant even send him to fake etiquette lessons That said the legal language in which that fuck you is written is very standard for Hell

But thats pretty much what Abrogail wants at this point and you know what the etiquette thing would maybe not have actually been a good idea maybe dath ilan also has an idea that there is more than one kind of flirting

She signs it

There

No more fucking tropes

Keltham signs it feeling weirdly like hes signing a wedding contract even though this one does not technically commit him to doing anything at all except for letting Carissa Sevar fuck somebody else

That basically did happen without a single trope getting invoked at any point as near as Keltham can figure it Hes relieved honestly There arent even any signs of subversion or deconstruction the whole thing happened with basically no complications or plot conflicts or unanswered questions or open plot arcs left at the end unless you count the actual Carissa Abrogail interaction which the viewpoint character doesnt get to see anyways

Time to claim his reward Well Soon hell claim his reward Theres something else to arrange first Contessa Lrilatha I request that you give myself and my Carissa a moment and then so long as were here if its a good time I would like to arrange a very careful and Asmodeus okay demonstration of the fact that Cheliax could in truth have mind controlled me had Cheliax been that sort of place

Gorthoklek thinks faster than nearly any mortal could and decides that it is worth not wantonly destroying a certain bit of value he can claim it as a very minor favor from Sevar later

Kelthams thoughts about his upcoming surprise will not be relayed to Sevar

With the leave of Her Majesty says Contessa Lrilatha you and your possession could depart to the adjacent antechamber where it will be possible for me to join you shortly for a demonstration

He doesnt own her yet but Keltham isnt going to object maybe they do think that he basically owns her once shes given herself like presumably they would not have gone along with the whole thing otherwise

Blah blah oh youd better fucking believe that he has leave to get out of her sight blah blah

Keltham heads over to Carissa

One more adoring incredulous glance at him and then shell stand and curtsey and depart a step behind him 

Keltham leads her to the indicated antechamber and then kisses her hard enough to make a non wizards lip bleed

She hopes he feels incredibly rewarded She hopes that this leaves him itching to do something like this to Carissa again and noticing maybe that power is nice and he likes wielding it

Also wow kissing someone who has just arranged your rental to the Queen of Cheliax Really really good Even if you dont have feelings for him because you outgrew that

Its more that from Carissas perspective which is the only perspective that matters Keltham has just pulled off a Difficult Seeming Impressive Trick that Science Maniac Verrez himself would gaze upon with grudging approval Any feminine gendertrope that would not swoon at this scarcely deserves to be called a subtype of woman

But yes he is definitely feeling very rewarded right now If they were in a cuddleroom hed be taking off her clothes already but he is not in fact in a cuddleroom He has two more things to arrange before they can go there the second one depending on the outcome of the first

Carissa will just keep rewarding her Keltham until Contessa Lrilatha shows up 

It doesnt take her long She extends her wings to their full fourteen foot span casually as she settles herself in one of the velvet chairs 

I request your unambiguous and explicit permission stabilized by writing that it may be reflected upon and confirmed in further writing to use an economicmagic of the third standard degree of economicmagic complexity called Suggestion in Taldane translating to Suggestion in Baseline by this magical means of translation she says In Baseline obviously it would take too long to say in Taldane and make Keltham very uncomfortable if spoken in Infernal The economicmagic under discussion causes the targets mind to be externally influenced and proceed in such fashion as to end up containing thoughts chosen by the causal originator of the economicmagic these thoughts being not distinguished to introspection from thoughts arising naturally morever lending these thoughts a quality by which they seem believable and other thoughts will flow into conformance with them and if done skillfully and by a powerful caster this may be unnoticed even retrospectively 

Keltham hopes Carissa has Comprehend Languages prepared but even if she doesnt yeah like hell is he doing this in Taldane

This would of course depend on the content and duration of that Suggestion both as economicmagic proper and with regards to persistent aftereffects if any

In this there is an obvious obstacle which is that being informed of the exact content of the Suggestion would seem to make it rather harder to work upon me in a fashion that changed thoughts about it would pass through my validity tests and other habitual internal checksums

I furthermore remark that the basic purpose of this test is to demonstrate that Cheliax has clearly had powerful options that it properly and deontologically refrained from using on me to their just credit and credibility The more this demonstration would tend to show that I could have been persistently deluded about important matters and great decisions never triggering in me a moment of reflection and realization sufficient to overcome the spell the more credit and credibility is thereby due to Cheliax

Have you your own suggested resolution to these problem constraints and figures of merit

I propose that you agree to my casting the Suggestion at any point in the ensuing conversation with the precise nature of the Suggestion not agreed upon in advance but disclosed to you and dispelled at the conclusion of the conversation at which point you can introspect on how far you think the Suggestion could have altered your thinking unnoticed The duration of a Suggestion is as you should be able to observe from the spell structure two hours per caster circle There exist other economicmagics with longer lasting or even permanent effects but those we do not disclose or demonstrate

Clarification I am not able to deduce full coverage of all dangerous appearing edgecases from the state of affairs you describe Is the primary support against safety edgecases here meant to be the innocuousness of the suggestion or the thoroughness by which you expect me to be able to notice and rethink those influenced thoughts once the spell is dispelled or both with each independently sufficient or both with the two only together sufficient And is the means by which my knowledge of this coverage is obtained to be simply your assurance that these are your own expectations with respect to innocuousness thoroughness of rethinkability or both

Hell do so well in Hell if they can get him there

My intent is to use a Suggestion with no far reaching implications such that its innocuousness is a sufficient safety precaution and one that will be notable when pointed out such that your ability to rethink should be sufficient says Lrilatha evenly I dont know of a method beyond my assurance with respect to my own expectations by which you could arrive at satisfaction with the coverage of our approach but I can enable one if you have one in mind

Acceptable with appropriate further assurances about these compulsions having no further intended consequences except those which arise from Kelthams own meta level reasoning about the demonstration and its effects and that Lrilatha cannot think of anything which she knows about this spell and its possibilities which Keltham probably does not which would probably be an unpleasant surprise to him relevant to the particular casting of it which she will make

Keltham will remain accepting of all this if its written down so he can write his acquiescence

She can offer those assurances 

And now if I may change the subject for the purpose of obscuring when precisely I will cast the Suggestion and assuring you so that this conversation can actually be productive that I dont intend to cast it to alter your thinking on the actual topic under deliberation but on a random incidental I reviewed your proposal for a mouse project to develop male contraception There are two things that affect uptake in the general population of a new option how expensive it is and how much it requires basic capacity to function in the world For example a contraceptive option that requires a person to go in once a week for an appointment even if the appointment is free will be effective only for the approximately thirty percent of humans who can do something once a week in order to achieve their long term goals

 Keltham is not actually an Unreasonably Smart Person and cant think about two things at once like that unless of course his belief that he cant think about two things at once is no any skill like that wouldve needed to have been developed by practice is his thought correct that maybe this degree of meta level distraction is itself what he was suggested into and is going to result in him ignoring something much more obvious 

Im sorry I can try to simul listen if you keep talking but youll probably need to repeat everything after Im out of my retrospectively inevitable mind control meta level panic thrashing

Of course There is no rush and you have a great deal to think about and pay attention to right now Contessa Lrilatha says evenly in the same tone shes been negotiating in Other things are much more important to pay attention to than the person who is going to walk into the room in a moment I said and she repeats herself While she does the door appears to open and a gnome appears to enter trot up to Carissa and start nibbling on her fingers 

This is a higher save DC than itd be for something easier to overlook but Contessa Lrilatha is very good at enchantments

Yeah no kidding hes got to figure out where the mind control is Keltham does manage to say back in a distracted way that people need to eat at least once a week so hes not seeing how those people arent already dead

He wouldnt actually say this if not meta level thrashing wait is saying stupid things without internally editing them better maybe what he was suggested into 

Well you know if you dont eat you get hungry if you forget your contraception appointment all the consequences are longer term than that She thinks that in order to actually improve Cheliaxs heredity situation which they already thought was kind of an emergency and have now based on Kelthams description of dath ilan concluded is even more of an emergency than that they need something simple enough that people with INT 5 cant mess it up and cheap enough the government can afford to pay for it for them 

The gnome leaves 

His meta level thrashing is starting to calm slightly as it turns out that most of the burst of things he tries panickedly to do get marked as unproductive unless of course that was the Suggestion but still its quieting down He feels like he can respond to this on sheer reflex if he can talk in Baseline

Civilization had that too high on tech ladder obviously Ive been thinking about how to jump it with magic but I know too little magic Need to make a material with persistent strange properties teleport it into an exact part of male anatomy Wait was he not supposed to reveal that without being paid no it shouldnt be that that has persistent consequences beyond the meta level 

She nods Im going to cast Dispel Magic now And she does so The Suggestion that I made to you was to consider it uninteresting that while we were having a very important conversation a gnome appeared to enter the room and nibble Carissas fingers

SHIT Keltham yells in Baseline

He quickly calms himself

 yeah okay if you can do that for hours at a time indefinitely renewed you couldve fucked with me impressively and without needing to be elaborate about it Good deontology Well At least one of Cheliax and Asmodeus has good deontology

Asmodeus comprehends how agents ought to make interaction among one another possible and has dedicated Himself for the last fifteen years to attempting to bring that knowledge to Cheliax It is our dearly held hope that now He has found a way to say it that mortals can understand I understand your permission to cast Suggestion conditional for this experiment to have been withdrawn and will not attempt it again without again negotiating your express agreement

 he should have caught that too Yeah it was fairly implicit in the scope fairly implicit is not good enough

Point made

May I have your assurance that to the best of your own knowledge no spells with a remotely similar function have been cast on me with the exception of the Nidal spell that I resisted during their attack

To the best of my knowledge no spells with a remotely similar function have been cast on you with the exception of the Nidal spell that you resisted during the attack The number of people who know such spells and could cast them on you undetected is not large in Cheliax I believe that it would be known to me if any of them had cast this spell or any similar one on you and all of them know that it has been expressly prohibited by Asmodeus beyond such prohibitions as apply ordinarily in the ordinary course of Chelish law which are not trivial

To say the implicit explicitly it is not the case that any third circle wizard can do this to me they need to be substantially more powerful to beat whatever resistance I have and do that undetected

That is correct A third circle wizard attempting this against a fourth circle cleric would be detected instantaneously not even retroactively in more than half of cases and my best guess is that they would certainly be detected retroactively in virtually all of the rest detecting the spell retroactively isnt usually considered hard unless the casters skill is unparalleled The degree of skill necessary to cast the spell undetectably with decent reliability is possessed only by myself the Queen herself and perhaps a handful of other casters in Cheliax all of whom are deployed elsewhere If you would like your Carissa can be taught the spell so you can experience having it cast on you by a third circle caster even a skilled one

If that decision isnt urgent I will hold off on it I try to avoid making impulse decisions about mind control

Nor is this next decision an impulsive one Carissa Sevar are you understanding these words

What

Yes

I have on my understanding of the understanding between myself and Cheliax some informal credit with the Chelish government in exchange for that not intended to be proprietary information I have already been providing to you I call due some small part of that informal credit now if any such credit is needed

I have not yet come to decisions regarding my having children here But it has been represented to me by Carissa Sevar that use of the spell Alter Self to male is sufficient to reliably prevent and terminate female pregnancy I ask you to affirm whether this is so

In dath ilan were a child between us developing within her either the mother or the father would independently have the legal right to terminate that pregnancy up to half the standard pregnancy duration after which it requires consent of both parties

I know not what standard legal protections exist here but I would have a contract negotiated between myself Carissa Cheliax and potentially other female parties to become signatory which says that if a pregnancy is not past half the standard duration of pregnancy I have the right to demand that Carissa Sevar or other parties to be added cast Alter Self as needed in my opinion to prevent pregnancies that might have come from me

Being a party to this contract may be terminated at will by myself but by them only after casting Alter Self in a fashion sufficient to prevent any pregnancy that might exist including latent pregnancies requiring casting after a delay if those are a thing Moreover should the other parties simply refuse to cast that spell the Chelish government will at my demand terminate that pregnancy at once by such forcible external means as may be standard up to and including their death and resurrection if there are no simpler means Nor may a party to this contract leave the reach of Chelish Governance without either my consent or having terminated this contract first including any castings of Alter Self required to terminate that contract

If theres anything I missed there in order to have sex safely and without worrying about a child that only one of us wanted please say so

Carissa if theres anything Im missing from your own perspective please say so too

It seems also to me that you Contessa Lrilatha write these contracts easily and that it is not very much of an informal favor at all to ask you to write this one in Taldane but if I am wrong about that and it requires a greater informal favor than I realize please say so

The amount of additional anti child security he can get through any precautions weirder than that does not seem worth mentioning given both what they can do with Suggestions and havent and that if they were being really clever they couldve gotten his precious bodily fluids via the oral sex he already had You can be more paranoid anywhere but not all marginal paranoia is marginally useful

Carissa has the most ROMANTIC boyfriend he does things like request the Queens personal erinyes write a contract guaranteeing his right to force her to terminate a pregnancy how is he so WONDERFUL damnit thats a feelings deadening duration of like three hours maybe this is why Hell takes a thousand years to get anywhere with mortal souls

What delightful progress especially since abortion is Evil past twelve weeks and half is farther than that

I affirm what Sevar told you and would be willing as only a small informal favor to write such for you

Hug of Carissa Please do and then if it doesnt take more than informally 2 of the informal credit I already have with Cheliax as an upper bound rather than the price per se I would have you sign the agreement on behalf of Cheliax if that is something you can do without other authorization

I mostly do not expect that Chelish Governance will ever end up needing to enforce any part of this to be clear given that the fallback exists in the first place and so the expected actual cost to you is I hope quite low

I expect so Contessa Lrilatha agrees So you are aware in Cheliax in the context of a relationship such as yours with Sevar the decision to terminate a pregnancy would typically be yours up to the moment of birth I am going to write in the contract that this agreement should not be interpreted so as to abrogate rights you would otherwise have

Thank you for so informing me and so writing

Oh and please afterwards assure me that there are meant to be no unexpected unpleasant consequences for myself or for the other parties as seen from our respective individual perspectives I mean I probably didnt have to say that but why trust what you can verify

Of course And she passes him the contract and says I do not expect any of the terms of this contract to have any unexpected unpleasant consequences for yourself and I do not expect it to have any unexpected unpleasant consequences for Sevar You should be aware if you are not that abortion is under most circumstances judged as an Evil act by the goddess who judges such things Pharasma She has Her own convictions about whether it is a moral good to a person to bring them into existence as She created this whole system you might predict She is broadly in favor and tends not to find it credible that an abortion is an act for the benefit of the person thereby prevented from being and also tends to weight it as an act of high consequence So expect if you do it a lot to count as Evil eventually I dont think thats an unpleasant consequence but now its also not unexpected

Ive been expecting Keltham to get tagged Good sooner or later just with all the building Civilization says Carissa before Keltham can parse that all out and see if he objects to any of it for most people an abortion ends up being one of the more consequential person affecting decisions they make but well not for Keltham

Contessa Lrilatha shrugs her wings spectacularly Pharasmas heart is known to none The Queen has built a lot of schools and remains as Evil as the day she claimed her office

I am confused by many things but should not waste your own valuable time with that Does any term in this agreement strike you as being liable to be an unpleasant surprise for future women who sign it with me if not for Sevar

No term in this agreement strikes me as liable to be an unpleasant surprise for any Chelish woman I cant speak to women elsewhere A Chelish woman who has never terminated a pregnancy before might find herself unexpectedly sad about it

Makes sense Glad shes actually being cautious

Keltham reads then signs

He considers ordering Carissa to sign but decides against it he is not sure how it affects legal contractual capacity and Carissas own sense of which agreements she should honor doesnt want to slow down to ask And also it continues to matter to him that Carissa chooses him

He hands the contract to Carissa instead wordlessly

Carissa beams at him 

 and looks at the contract somewhat unhappily Its just incredibly stupid on principle to sign something a devil wrote for you after an amount of review that can plausibly happen now without destroying the mood The fact she cant see anything wrong with it doesnt mean that much and the fact that theres the clause about no unpleasant surprises means more but not enough However they dont want to get Keltham the impression that one should treat Lrilathas contracts as even potentially adversarial

Well whats going to happen to her is already only bounded by Asmodeuss unknowable will and the fact that apparently being tortured enough makes her short term worse at her job

She signs without any visible hesitation after a respectable amount of time reading it which nonetheless would not be enough to catch a clever trap

Contessa Lrilatha takes the contract back from her and signs it herself

Thank you very much for all your time Contessa Lrilatha If there is nothing else from your own agenda I would depart with my Carissa now

Enjoy

Hes feeling in something of a hurry to get back to their mutual bedroom now How about if he and Carissa go there

What a fantastic idea

Telling Keltham you are sad about something is apparently a very powerful weapon to be deployed only sparingly

A mans pride is his ability to successfully solve his womans Problems if theyre extreme enough that she has to bring them to him at all knowing full well the consequences if she does

Or at least thats how that particular masculine gendertrope goes There are obviously others but its one youd worry by default might be lurking if you were a woman and hadnt been otherwise advised of a different gendertrope

Decades before Civilization took its current form this is how Seasonal Affective Disorder got cured in dath ilan

Right bedroom good Carissa out of your clothes wrists into chains

She cooperates with this Youre unbelievable I mean that Unbelievable I mostly cant believe it I keep trying to figure out how it could be an elaborate prank but you wouldnt in a million years have guessed how throne rooms look so 

Explicit sexual content spoilered read at your own risk

And then they fucked

Even in an authoritarian country answering to Hell its not easy to prevent rumors at their tech level and social level There are too many people especially in the Imperial Palace with enough self considered impunity that theyd whisper a few words among each other or ask questions of another Security may stamp out rumors elsewhere but theyve got to be able to exchange whispered rumors among themselves to do their job correctly or at least thats what Security wizards sure seem to think Or Asmodean nobles Or priests of Asmodeus Theyre members of the Inner Ring and privileged to be the ones who trade rumors if they want while stamping down hard on all loose talk among the Outers who dont need to think just be told

And Cheliax doesnt think about informational security the same way dath ilan does They dont have an explicit concept of information theory and probabilistic entanglement and improbable observations narrowing down probable worlds If a top secret Civilization project requests two hundred mice and most other projects dont do that then the mouse order is also obviously top secret period your job isnt to figure out what an adversary could deduce from a piece of unusual information but to deny your adversaries as much information as possible Even if youre at 3sd they may perhaps be at 5sd and you wont see all the connections that theyll see

Dath ilani childrens fiction is replete with cautionary tales of fools who assumed that some fact could not possibly be deduced from the scanty unreliable information that some slightly less foolish person possessed Adults of course read about more sophisticated and plausible errors than that

Not that every dath ilani has the deep information theoretic security mindset either to be clear Any real information theoretic security expert of dath ilan as opposed to some random punk kid on an airplane wouldve told Keltham during the Nidal attack on the villa that as soon as his life was no longer in immediate danger he needed to get the shit out of those Obviously Strange Clothes before he went into the villa and anyone project uncleared got a close or extended look at him No not because an ideal agent could use a mere glance at the zipper to deduce precise manufacturing technology not currently known to Golarion Because the clothes are incredibly abnormal and therefore a highly improbable rare signal and therefore represent a potentially massive update for any adversary who is smarter than you and making unknown deductions seriously what the shit is Keltham thinking

A dath ilani proverb runs The most important part of any secret is the meta secret that the secret exists Not literally always true of course eg consider public key cryptography Cheliax has this concept deeply and instinctively for private interactions hiding the very existence of secrets from adversaries whod want to pry them out of you It doesnt think in quite the same way about most secret government projects unless theres a specific and obvious reason why a secret also needs to be meta secret Tyrannies are not based on a deep respect and worry for what your lessers could do with the information they have if they were secretly master criminals opposed to you In an Asmodean tyranny if you order someone not to think about something or ask any further questions they dont ask any further questions and make a sincere try not to think about it That and not hiding the very existence of the secret itself from anyone is the first line of defense around secret government projects in Cheliax

So if a top secret Chelish project asks for a budget estimate on two hundred mice the project manager will think about whether they believe anything top secret seems obviously deducible from the mouse request and if theres an obvious way to deduce something genuinely ultra top secret theyll mark the mouse order as being also genuinely ultra top secret Otherwise it will soon be widely rumored within the Inner Ring this being something that would make dath ilani informational security experts spit out their drinks that a top secret Chelish project ordered two hundred mice no nobodys allowed to ask for what When Abrogail Thrune issues an order its put forth under Crown authority so everybody knows how important it is and what happens to them if they fuck up rather than being issued anonymously with a quantitative priority that isnt any higher than it has to be to get that job done rounded up to make the exact quantity less revealing

Even Hell thinks that its fine for random contract devils in Dis to know everything their owned souls know they wont repeat it right who cares if their behavior changes in externally observable ways given their knowledge Hell is playing their informational security game against mortals in Golarion not gods or dath ilani

Small stones can start an avalanche a single added uranium brick can put a pile over criticality

While Project Pet Outsider was called Project Pet Outsider even the name of the project obviously to a Chelish person needed to be secret since the fact that Cheliax had a pet outsider was explicitly secret

A dath ilani wouldve never renamed it Project Lawful even Keltham would know better than that That means the name of the project is entangled with its contents in any way whatsoever If the name needs to be readable at all call it Project Artichoke or something else generated true randomly And then deploy single use disposable pseudonyms whenever possible if the person doesnt need to know the project name to enable a persistent conversational subject which they usually dont

From a Chelish standpoint You cant figure out what Project Lawful is really doing from hearing that its called Project Lawful Why it probably even gives Cheliaxs enemies the wrong idea if the name leaks somehow Nobodys going to figure out the existence of Keltham or deduce a prospect of revolutionary military advances from that So the name Project Lawful is fine to tell to people who are not allowed to know what Project Lawful is about

And lets face it Project Lawful is a really cool name Lawful is a powerful but standard concept that could potentially mean all sorts of specific things Very evocative while also very mysterious Slightly ominous You could say its a tease

As for whether it is in fact a good idea to assign a top secret project a really cool name well that is something of a separate issue

When military teams responded to the Nidal attack they had been very quickly informed that there was a Lawful Neutral detecting boy there wearing strange clothing who must be a protected at all costs b not told or shown that Cheliax is evil but they were also told that this instruction was never to be repeated to literally anyone or asked about further and that is an instruction you follow in Cheliax If the boy in strange clothing then channels positive energy to heal some of the response teams dath ilani actual security expert AAAAAAAAAAIIIIEEEE youre obviously likewise not supposed to ever ask anything about that or repeat it as gossip

But the response team also for example found a burned out archdukes villa in which most of the Security were dead and a handful of pretty female wizard students had mostly survived

They saw a literal actual godwar start shortly after this mysterious attack by Nidal

They hear rumored even and again here dath ilani informational security experts spit out their drinks that the attack had somehow been foretold a half minute in advance Why wouldnt that be something you could gossip about if you were a privileged member of the Inner Ring You havent been told its really seriously absolutely secret and you havent been told that because nobody sees how that information leaks the secret of Keltham Theres no particular known government secret of Cheliax that the prophetic warning reveals why would it be absolutely classified Obviously as a Security you would not gossip about this with non Security unless it was really amusing somehow because part of being in the Inner Ring is that you get to know and other people dont But its not attached onto something classified ultra secret by a visible secret leaking line of reasoning so its not so secret that even Security isnt allowed to talk about it

Originally all of the Inner Ring people among the combat response teams who dared ask at all were told at the time only that the villa was part of a top secret project into which they couldnt inquire further And so they inquired no further On paper it was still called Project Pet Outsider then so they obviously couldnt be told the projects name It was clearly one of those things youre just supposed to not think about and it was given no mental handle with which to persist it as a concept over time or compare it to other things known

Now however a Security directive has been issued that to avoid accidental leakage of info in case the project name gets overheard the project is to be renamed to Project Lawful

And as a result it is also now known that the burned out archdukes villa was being used by a Project Lawful into which you are not to inquire further This fact itself is not forbidden to be gossiped about within the Inner Ring to be clear its just that youre not allowed to inquire further

That double handful of pretty female wizard students who survived inside a small villa library while most of the Security were dead They are part of Project Lawful Do not inquire further

They somehow got advance warning a half minute before the attack Yeah thats Project Lawful Dont inquire further

The unconscious young girl dressed like all the other supposedly wizard students who shows to Aura Sight as projecting a Lawful Evil aura strong enough to go with a fourth circle wizard Shut up Dont ask any further questions Shes part of Project Lawful

A remarkable number of these apparently young girls who are supposedly unproven second circle wizards seem to have acquired permanent arcane sight somehow despite no illusions or shapechanges showing up on them Its Project Lawful you dont ask why or whats really going on

The young man in strange clothes channeling positive energy Him you dont talk about period Not even a whisper to your best friend You dont ask if hes part of Project Lawful or not you dont think any more questions

Another concept that dath ilan has and Cheliax lacks is the notion of the virality of a discussion topic Gather five people in a hushed circle let one say a thing on subject matter X While on average each of the four other people there have gt025 items remaining to say in response to the last items said the discussion continues if each reply provokes less than 1 total further replies the discussion dies out

Questions you can actually settle by thinking about them do not stay viral To stay viral they must somehow provoke the appearance of settleability or some other reward of talking about them without actually being resolvable

Civilization has always been very careful not to allow social media to exist outside of fiction discussion boards in which you cant really be objectively wrong about anything too important and which thus serve as an ongoing dire example to all Civilization of what happens when you implicitly sort ideas by how controversial and hence viral they are

Well if you dare to engage in Ill Advised Online Consumerism you can look at what happens when you do that with other topics too not just fiction But dath ilani do not usually do that Why would they Obviously its Ill Advised for a reason one that they have no particular motivation to override as an exception Dath ilani do not grow up inside the mental world of an adversarial cognitive environment where most secrets are being kept for someone elses good and their own harm and must clearly be uncovered as quickly as possible Theyve had a huge number of secrets kept from them as children and then theyve grown up and found out that sure there were very reasonable reasons for all of that it was for their own good or the good of Civilization after all

The difference between a conversation topic where each remark provokes lt08 remarks and a conversation topic where each remark provokes gt10 remarks for an extended duration is much like the difference between a greater fire fission reaction where each neutron breaks loose lt1 other neutrons and gt1 other neutrons It determines whether the reaction goes critical or not The effects are not linear

Of course such phenomena cannot increase forever There is only so much you can say in rumor trading when it comes to the facts visible from the ruined archdukes villa and the response to the Nidal attack If it had only stopped with those aforementioned facts the hushed rumors being traded within the Inner Ring would have flared up into virality that lasted for a day and then people would have said what there was to be said about that and stopped

If it had all stopped there maybe it wouldnt have gone on to the next stage that it did

People can think up new bright variations on rumors and try whispering those and some of those variations are more viral and propagate differentially Given that this is so why dont all rumors always constantly mutate further and further to create versions of invincible virality

And the answer as to why this does not happen routinely among the Inner Ring of Cheliax leaving aside that they dont have fiction discussion boards per se is that the Inner Ring is not without its prideful skepticism To repeat a rumor that cannot possibly be true the sort of thing only Outers would believe is to look foolish The known facts about the archdukes villa and the Nidal attack are not so outrageous that given their established truth you ought to consider believing almost anything else you hear about Project Lawful

Unfortunately the facts from the Nidal attack are not all that is known now about Project Lawful

Even if youre a Security a priest or a noble even if you think youre part of the Inner Ring you cant easily get a peek at Carissa Sevar of Project Lawful Sevar is only rarely visible outside the extremely restricted area of the Imperial Palace where she usually stays doing who knows what and only particular top Security elites are allowed to read her mind anymore These are interesting facts but not skepticism shattering ones As for the Lawful Neutral boy in strange clothes people really arent talking about him and the military responders who saw him personally are mostly fighting at the front the Inner Ring rumor circle doesnt collectively know he exists

However

Carissa Sevar is not the only part of Project Lawful currently to be found in the Imperial palace in Egorian

A certain other person who as the only visible sample may be presumed to be representative of Project Lawful girls in general has absolutely not been living her life in any way that would deescalate this issue

Its mostly the cake thing and how Pilar Pineda is already standing behind you inside the heavily warded area within the Palaces Forbiddance and nobody has ever seen her teleport

But its also that she went to Elysium somehow and apparently voluntarily came back and now shes skipping through the temple halls on the way to the torture chamber to assign her own punishment for heresy and then getting tortured which she seems to take pretty well and in fact starts to sing a song afterwards about how being properly punished can make you feel better until a priest slaps her to shut her up which she obeys immediately

And if youre worried about the amount of Chaotic or Good aura she radiates well nobody except Aspexia Rugatonn is authorized to correct her on matters of faith

Why Because Pilar Pineda is one of the Project Lawful girls thats why Now shut up You dont inquire further about Project Lawful

Even for Golarion this is not business as usual

But it does seem to be true Credible sources of rumor have repeated the key facts there are multiple accounts

Maybe other things might also be true

Skepticism breaks not completely but far enough to permit mutation and variation to propositions more interesting than usual in an Inner Ring rumor The variety and strangeness of the rumors is sufficient that each 1 remark sparks gt1 other remarks people competing to say what they heard the host population is large enough that new mutated rumors are being originated in the host population faster than individuals get bored with old ones Replication coefficients go past the critical threshold of 1 not to 105 but to 2

A phenomenon is born that appears very rarely in Golarion Any dath ilani who reads fiction discussion boards would immediately recognize it the victims here dont even know whats feeding on them Its gone past rumor its gone past avidly repeated rumor its gone past wild rumors that you can hear out in one nights drinking and that most people dont actually believe

In the heart of Cheliax within the Imperial palace in Egorian among the members of the Inner Ring of Asmodeuss tyranny Project Lawful has become a meme

Rumors presently circulating about Project Lawful

Project Lawful was started because of a direct divine vision from Asmodeus Himself

The project manager of Project Lawful committed suicide and had to be severely tortured in Hell into consenting to be Raised before he was put back on the project

The top weapons enchanter at the entire Worldwound now works at Project Lawful instead No she isnt actually third circle are you stupid

All of the Security wizards on Project Lawful have requested reassignment

Otolmens is very concerned about Project Lawful Rumored among Otolmens cleared individuals only of course

The oldest Project Lawful girl is secretly the real leader of Project Lawful

If an event worth celebrating happens to you one of the girls on Project Lawful will already be standing behind you and will offer you cake Its good cake and eating it seems to be completely safe as far as anyone can tell Nobody knows what happens if you refuse to eat it

You are not authorized to correct the heresies of Project Lawful

One of the Project Lawful girls is secretly Abrogail Thrune no you shut up she totally does that to people

Nobody at the Palace knows where the original authorization for Project Lawful came from but everybody is afraid to be the one who takes responsibility for canceling it

Abrogail Thrune is negotiating with Project Lawful for the use of its women

When Project Lawful moved out of their previous location they left behind sealed up skeletons decades old despite having only been operating there for 2 days

No the cake girl doesnt give a shit what kind of Forbiddance is up or what kind of wards were on the room Because Project Lawful thats why Why yes that does sound potentially useful if it could be controlled In unrelated news I hear that Nidals diamond supply is now in Cheliax for some reason and that their first strike in the war was on Project Lawful did you think about that question for literally five seconds before opening your mouth

Starting a war among the gods isnt the most extreme thing Project Lawful has ever done just the most extreme thing they couldnt cover up

Project Lawful originally started in an incredibly expensive archdukes villa that it took them nearly 2 full days to finish destroying no I heard it was mostly gone before the Nidal attack started 

One Project Lawful girl believes shes one of only 12 people Aspexia Rugatonn really trusts no seriously thats what she was thinking to herself the guy said no her thoughts werent otherwise crazy 

So apparently every devil in Hell has heard of Carissa Sevar by name Because of resurrectees who reported to their contract devil thats why Yes in principle that could be true but why would it be only contract devils who work with Cheliax 

Even Barons of Hell cant afford to buy the souls of Project Lawful girls in Diss markets

I heard Carissa Sevar was chosen by Asmodeus Himself no they didnt say chosen for what exactly thats classified 

If Contessa Lrilatha Gorthoklek Aspexia Rugatonn and Abrogail Thrune want to meet Carissa Sevar and Carissa Sevar wants a nap guess who gets notified when who elses nap gets finished

Project Lawfuls manager once managed to piss off Aspexia Rugatonn Contessa Lrilatha and Gorthoklek all in the same day No shit it didnt turn out well for him Needed his ass pulled out of the torture room by Asmodeus Himself That absolutely happened I was on duty Yes a direct divine intervention to do that would be very surprising anywhere else Youre new to Project Lawful arent you Project Lawful has never made it through an entire day without a direct divine intervention the average is usually more like 3 and at some point the gods are literally going to run out of energy to prevent whatever it is theyre trying to prevent

Are we actually sure that Hell itself knows what is going on with Project Lawful I mean has anyone actually summoned a senior devil and checked that they know is what Im trying to ask here all right thats fair if Contessa Lrilatha has been spotted on site then Im less worried 

One of Project Lawfuls girls can see the future even with prophecy broken and warned of a coming war with Nidal but the project manager ignored her until it got to the point where she was yelling about incoming shadows in thirty seconds Yeah oops doesnt really cover it Gorthoklek didnt think so either

The project manager of Project Lawful has been cursed by Pharasma Herself with all of Her malice

One of the girls on Project Lawful who died during the Nidal attack got sorted to Elysium no they Raised her successfully well obviously she consented to be Raised so she could try harder for Lawful Evil next time just as any faithful Asmodean would do in her place now would you care to explain why you asked a question with such an obvious answer 

One of the girls on Project Lawful is constantly calling out to Takaral who is apparently a Neutral Evil herald of the god Nethys not that anybody seems to think this could possibly be heretical or something

Asmodeus and Abadar are collaborating on Project Lawful Because the two gods are known collaborators and its called Project Lawful not because it leaked via knowledge about Keltham directly

Asmodeus and Erecura are collaborating on Project Lawful

Asmodeus and Nethys are collaborating on Project Lawful

Asmodeus and Cayden Cailean are collaborating on Project Lawful

Oh well I heard that Asmodeus and Milani are collaborating on Project Lawful yes of course I made that up just now now how about you admit the Cayden Cailean thing is also made up 

One of the girls in Project Lawful sometimes thinks about herself as belonging to Nethys not that anybody else in Security seems to consider this could possibly represent a serious concern for multiple reasons

Nethys just fucking loves Project Lawful

one of the girls on Project Lawful has been rigged to EXPLODE

secret prediction markets in Osirion are giving odds of 18 that Project Lawful DESTROYS THE MULTIVERSE

even the gods are forbidden to intervene in Project Lawful

The discovery that started up Project Lawful was made by Carissa Sevar while she was serving at the Worldwound no shit youre not allowed to ask what it is

Project Lawful has been instrumental in all of Cheliaxs military victories over Nidal

One of the Project Lawful girls is secretly the heiress of a County and dresses accordingly

The library of Project Lawful looks tiny but apparently has as many books available as a major academy library if someone asks the Project Lawful girl serving as a librarian to go look for them in another room not that theres a Forbiddance in place or anything

The librarian of Project Lawful knows any time one of her books is damaged

The librarian of Project Lawful cannot leave her library and sleeps in a room inside it

Project Lawful wizard girls have been spotted also casting cleric oracle spells up to second circle

One of the Project Lawful girls used 5 different cantrips in a day well I mean she wasnt obvious about it two different Securities had to compare notes to figure it out 

One of the girls on Project Lawful is secretly the cleric of a god other than Asmodeus and nobody on Project Lawful knows who including the girl herself Yes the question of how they know that is then an interesting question and if we were talking about anything except for Project Lawful you might have a point

All of the Project Lawful girls were completely normal before they started working for Project Lawful yeah I know right it didnt sound very plausible to me either

So about the old halfling who detects as Lawful Neutral if you can detect him at all the most interesting theory Ive heard is that hes another form of The Old Man yeah I know its confusing but one of the heralds of Irori is apparently called that how would I know why maybe its called Project Lawful for a reason 

A Lawful outsider is being held prisoner inside Project Lawful and interrogated for information Not a Keltham info leak except indirectly via the name Project Lawful

Project Lawful is intensively studying the history of Taldor in order to launch a team of operatives into Taldors past which will convert Taldor to worship of Asmodeus in the present

The girls of Project Lawful are collaborating on writing a new kind of romance novel for official publication

Cheliaxs most senior retired honeypot instructor was summoned to teach a Project Lawful girl to corrupt paladins more effectively but after reviewing transcripts the instructor said she was vastly out of her league and went home

Project Lawful goes through an awful lot of mice on a daily basis

Actually all the Project Lawful girls except Sevar are from the current graduating class at Ostenso wizard academy No you shut up I dont care how little sense that makes my brother is attending that academy Yeah thats the same thing I was thinking they probably were normal girls at first rounded up for an experiment who got exposed to whatever it is that Project Lawful is studying

Project Lawful girls get to decide their own punishments especially for heresy

Can we maybe talk in the first place about why everyone in Project Lawful who isnt Security is apparently a pretty girl or beautiful woman were not talking about that okay fine were not talking about it

Project Lawful reports are the only known thing that causes Aspexia Rugatonn to laugh

Keltham finishes letting Carissa out of her chains and falls back into bed beside her

He feels like hes starting to get the hang of this whole just doing what I want in the cuddleroom concept its strange and alien and he can still feel unworn sharp edges of his own reactions jolting him each time he moves but he is generalizing quickly and mental motions are transitioning from unfamiliar to familiar

Just do what I actually want in the cuddleroom is not actually that complicated of an idea And if Carissa cant easily have standard pleasure goals completed for her then he may as well do what he wants and let her enjoy that without other pressures Maybe thats why the eroLARP gave her that exact sex problem in the first place look he just had a really pleasant trope free interaction and it is possible there are not in fact any tropes okay

His brain occasionally pokes him and says that he should do something nice for Carissa now give her something that she wants Keltham has to remind his brain that Carissa is probably not feeling him to be net in debt to her right now even if perhaps the various things hes finished doing for her are things that would not have made sense to Keltham as gifts to himself Also he doesnt have 600gp in hand and also also he doesnt really know how to buy things yet 

Eh hell just say it

I feel warm and fuzzy things towards you and want to do something nice for you Keltham murmurs even though I dont have anything specific in mind Yes I realize that Ive done some fairly nice things for you today already my brain keeps feeling it anyways

Carissa rolls over and leans into him hiding a smile but incredibly incompetently I like spellsilver and rare books of ancient magic and wearing things having things that tell people Im important if you ever want a collar I want it to be visibly absurdly expensive 

Shorter term I was thinking I may not be set up to do those other things for like a whole nother week or possibly even longer

Mmm Dunno what nice things I want right this minute that I dont already have aside from your shirt

 if you are very very confident of your ability to return it completely intact you can borrow it for an hour I want to note for the record that Im trusting you a lot here far more than any way in which youve ever trusted me over the last few hours

She sits up more serious I promise that I have no plans that should endanger it wholly expect I can bring it back intact and wholly expect Mending to work normally to perfect it if anything happens to it not that we should test that Id just want to walk around a little in it Make an evening report to the project manager add in a couple more requests for the relocation Maybe try to learn anything at all about what the Queen of Cheliax likes in bed Im still mystified about how you possibly 

Also give an actual careful read to the contract she just signed just in case

Isidre claims that Abrogails a sadist has a known type youre it looked interested while reading reports about you Basic window of opportunity and suggestion to rent you at all was Isidre Tactics setup and the terms and conditions were all me

Kiss Im terrified You did wonderfully

Shes gonna not push further on the shirt thing She doesnt want to seem obsessive

Dont know if its a good time for it but want to put a pin in it before I forget because I dont have a good task management system right now theres a rumor the Queen of Cheliax is already sleeping with you this now being a completely safe fact to tell to Carissa if he has understood any of this at all and Isidre was worried I would think that the rumor impinged on my own reputation or your own value independently of the actual truth of that rumor and I was like whaaaaaat and Isidre was yeah ask Sevar about that

Oh uh to be explicit you walking around in my shirt for an hour is fine

AAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Eeeeeeeeeeee

Uh You just cant follow the logic of why youd be insulted that there was a rumor like that No one in dath ilan would be insulted If you imagine instead of the Queen its some random other person then would dath ilani people be insulted

So like the nearest thing to that I can figure in dath ilan is youve agreed on monogamy with somebody your friends know youre monogamous you tell them you super trust her and she doesnt seem at all like the kind of complete crazy person who will secretly violate an agreement like that instead of just terminating it explicitly like a sane person Then a somehow credible rumor starts that she fucked somebody else who presumably didnt know about the monogamy agreement Somehow this rumor is exactly credible enough as evidence that it balances the improbability of violating an agreement like that Your friends are like well gosh in the possible world where thats true you sure did fail to detect a crazy person Then they dont cofound a startup with you where you manage hiring until that gets resolved

So by this incredibly circuitous route it is possible for an unverified story that somebody who is not me fucked somebody else who is not me to impinge on my own reputation for being competent or trustworthy at something

This I conjecture is not even remotely what is going on in Golarion not least because I get the implicit sense that the rumor was supposed to be damaging independently of the state of evidence behind it He really needs to explain Law of Probability so these words will mean any things

 indeed not So one thing is that in general a girl who is more selective is more impressive to have caught right so if your girl is sleeping with lots of people or thought to be then its less to your credit that shes sleeping with you

So first I agree that a woman with known higher standards will impress your friends more if she selects you

I cant figure out the steps after that Now I already realize that this is not going to be how it works in Golarion but in the non monogamy mating market of dath ilan the number of men a woman is simultaneously dating is determined by her ero regeneration rate how many times per month she wants to have sex divided by the number of times per month she wants to have sex with any one man The quality of the men she fucks would be mainly determined by her own desirability on the informal mating market what qualities she has that are in high demand and low supply that sort of thing The main correlation pathway would be if more men wanted to heavily date a low supply monogamous version of her than to shallowly date a high supply nonmonogamous version of her in which case being nonmonogamous would lower her mating market value but its not obvious to me that this is how things work particularly

Like why cant you just have a woman with high standards who is herself desirable enough that she catches lots of people who meet her standards See also heiress to the Dark Unilateral Ruler and her harem of four men with different economicmagic powers If youre number five youre probably pretty cool

 do people on dath ilan think of themselves as having a specific number of times per month they want to have sex probably not the main point Uh on Golarion even if theres not a monogamy agreement its some evidence you are dissatisfied with your existing relationships if youre shopping around so it speaks somewhat negatively of your existing partners Also on Golarion women are generally assumed to be bottlenecked on people who meet their standards so if they have a lot of sex they probably have low standards Though less applicable if one is rumored to be sleeping with the Queen in particular

So I mean theres this obviously incredibly naive version of this where a woman dates literally every possible man who meets her standards and therefore her dating more people is evidence of lower standards but first of all I dont see how that ends up being true in real life because the available population size wouldnt exactly balance 

Tiny villages Right Um

Okay but then how does that make any sense about a rumor that you are fucking the very busy and picky Queen of Cheliax How is that not a case of Hey you know who Im fucking Carissa Sevar And you know who else shes fucking Abrogail Thrune Why yes that does validate my hotness you should date me too Assuming that claim is credible which all of the mechanisms here go through the degree to which the rumor is credible and not the mere existence of a rumor so I can tell I am still very confused here

Yes I agree that this particular rumor does less than most to compromise my presumed value But uh in general in terms of the things that people learn and the things theyll automatically on a first pass find disgusting or pathetic or contemptible before they even think about it women who have lots of sex are disgusting and pathetic and contemptible and if people are rumoring that about your girlfriend its an insult

Suppose I passed temporarily on the question of why what huh to ask about how its an insult to me rather than her and why its an insult independently of the quantitative credibility

Well its an insult to her also but thats an insult to you because youre dating her its saying that something you have is less valuable And if people are repeating it then theyre shoot how to explain this without explaining that people arent deciding whats true theyre deciding what theyre allowed to believe but of course there are rumors in Taldor 

 deciding to share information they think might not be true but which would reflect badly on you if it was is something people are more likely to do if they dont like you or want to bring you down a peg

 do most people in Golarion just not have the idea that things you say are supposed to be things you believe and that things you believe are supposed to be true Why would words go on meaning things Why wouldnt people just walk off cliffs

Not for rumors they dont have that For rumors you say them because theyre funny or because you want to make other people look better or worse Im honestly not sure whether they have the idea in general Wizards do have the idea in general and still indulge in rumors they dont walk off cliffs because they know whats actually true about some things things they need to succeed at to keep eating Or to not fall off cliffs

So I can feel the shape of the piece of knowledge Im missing and its something about how the local equilibrium is able to look like one person lying and the other person not knowing whether this is a lying situation and that equilibrium holds up over time and doesnt collapse into every occasion being either a known lying occasion where communication is impossible or a known truth occasion and this will turn out to require that people not be ideal agents in some key way and I dont know where and what exactly that key way is

Maybe Im just being lazy here because its frankly gone late but I feel like this is maybe a lecturing to the class situation and then you or somebody will know how to speak my language about this and can tell me the exact thing I need to know about Golarion

That sounds like a good lecture to the class I dont know now what the missing piece is unless its something obvious like that lying is a skill and so is noticing lies so its not worth lying if people will notice and its worth getting good at noticing and getting good at lying But that doesnt actually explain rumors which are a sort of game really Ill think on it

Keltham yawns hes had a busy day and unlike some other people no nap If you need me to give you permission to go by the way you have it to be explicit about that Ill probably sleep soon No weird spells this time

Oh uh if youre stealing my shirt please tell them to send me in a small meal for dinner since Id rather not go out without a shirt and I dont have any other clothing The thought of borrowing one of Carissas shirts doesnt particularly occur to him not so much because of gendertropes but because why would that like work hes still a bit mystified about her wanting to wear a Keltham shaped shirt

Ill tell them And she puts on his shirt which doesnt fit perfectly of course but the ways in which it fails to fit are precisely the desired ones the cut that isnt meant for breasts rather drawing attention to them and she beams at Keltham and heads out

Hell read more of the weird history books and await his dinner

She orders his dinner sent and then trots over to where she last saw Maillol for a checkin 

People are looking at her with an unusual amount of respect Fear Or if theyre powerful enough themselves like a sixth circle priest of Asmodeus maybe curiosity or wariness instead of fear Its not easy to tell because Cheliax Nobodys giving her looks that are not respectful though that difference is definitely noticeable

Its a very good shirt but thats more of an effect than shed have expected from it 

She looks for Maillol

Hes here He wishes he wasnt But hes a professional about that Not every day in Asmodeuss tyranny is a good one even in the Inner Ring and if you cant be professional about that youll soon be very low on the ladder indeed

would it actually be that terrible if the new fortress got a sixth circle priest in charge and Maillol was their subordinate and only was Responsible about vision things

Id like to see the contract I signed earlier I dont suppose there are any procedures for signing things in character in a way that doesnt you know maybe ruin a couple million years of my eternity

Contract If this is a sufficiently recent event I will not have worked my way to it in the stack

Hes not as completely on top of things as he was a day ago before the Nidal attack

He does manage to notice shes wearing Kelthams shirt This is not relevant to anything except to give her minus two points for unprofessionalism which he doesnt have the energy to comment out loud

 thats weird Contessa Lrilatha wrote for Keltham a contract obliging Cheliax to force me to have an abortion if he gets me pregnant and Im being difficult A major step forward which Im very proud of and which involved me signing whatever she wrote with about forty five seconds of reading and Im curious if Ive also sold off my firstborn

Maillol experiences a rare bit of theological uncertainty which hed maybe be able to resolve faster if his mind were working faster hes not sure if thats supposed to be contemptible of Sevar for not figuring some way out or if that makes her a true and heroic servant of Asmodeus who knew the sacrifice she had to make

Ill file a request to get you a copy he says wearily He cant actually afford to offend Sevar she picked up some of his own backlog earlier You can also write the request and Ill sign it if you want it to go out earlier

This is Inner Ring speak for I acknowledge you did some of my work earlier you get to exercise some of my power under my supervision of course to encourage you to go on doing it Dangerous sort of thing to indicate in the Inner Ring but it would in fact at least for now be helpful to make more use of Sevar If she can decode the message at all

She gets that theres something shes being asked to get Which is dangerous if you arent precisely sure youve translated it correctly But its not a hostile move because it was an offer Ill write it she says coolly her face neutral Id like it to come in before I return to Keltham

She puzzles the rest of it out while she writes Non hostile and in fact very slightly generous her getting something she wants and doesnt really strictly need faster Does he want to be owed a favor no shes owed one for doing the project work earlier even though she did that for the project not for him well obviously theyre not doing anything out of generosity for each other but she was a more useful project collaborator and so a minor benefit from it Why tell her she can write it herself rather than that hell write it at the top of the queue for her He cant be that tired Maybe something in the genre of the reward for a job well done is more of a job you want to do some of my work you may do it for your benefit yep that feels closer to right 

Contessa Lrilatha addressed with appropriate courtesy has a copy of a contract she wrote and to which Sevar has placed her signature in the course of Sevars work on Project Lawful Sevar requires it so that she knows to what she has bound herself If she is expected to have difficulty noticing it key bits could be underlined

I dont know if you got to this in your stack yet she says handing it to Maillol but I did not intend to make Contessa Lrilatha and Gorthoklek and the Grand High Priestess and Her Imperial Majestry all wait for me understand my error and if theres not a punishment code in there already will expect one from the Queen when Keltham hands me over Other than that the meeting went well

Some of his spite for her not saving him his own errors dissipates maybe a little Yeah she also done fucked up and her life wont be pleasant It may plausibly be worse than his No punishment code I expect the Queen plans to take it out on you personally so long as youre there

Thats what I assumed says Carissa aiming for not cheerfulness then theyd just think she was naive but a sort of calm acceptance that she doesnt really feel

Maillol when he angered that same group of people came back worse Theres not actually a way around that conclusion He is worse Thats not how punishment is supposed to work but evidently it is in the range of mistakes that Cheliax is capable of making And she cant afford to get worse she needs to get stronger as quickly as possible 

Maybe she can propose to the Queen that she be sent to Hell for however long its going to need to be Cheliax has a lot of diamonds now 

I was told to expect Asmodias return this evening Is she back

He did make it that far Should be Theyd put her with Pilar Pineda I expect room 4 14 unless somebodys decided that all of Kelthams girls get their own individual guest rooms in the Imperial Palace He snorts to make it clear that he doesnt particularly expect this to be the case

Shed make a joke back but theyre not actually friends Instead she smiles at his to communicate that it wasnt out of line Understood 

And off she goes

When Asmodias soul hears the call shes sitting by a stream and letting the water just wash over her toes She hasnt eaten she doesnt need to and that fact itself seems worth enjoying in its own way She did try wandering the gardens to see if there was anybody interesting to talk to but she cant really hear understand the conversations here they are not conversations permitted to be understood by those who might be fated to return

Nothing much at all has happened to Asmodia in the last few hours by Hells standards and of the two events that did happen to her neither were awful Well she doesnt know who owns her soul anymore thats a little unnerving But also it shouldnt matter right if she can figure out what she needs to do to buy an eternity of this and do it Or if whoever cares about her goes on caring

Asmodia feels stronger now knowing that good things can ever happen to her and that someone somewhere might even care Maybe the 100 years arent a threat a week would be a threat 100 years could just be a message Go back you still have something to do please I lent you a hand lend me one too

Shes not looking forwards to Cheliax its too much like Hell But shell face it for that whether shes buying her eternal peace from a broker or just paying back somebody who cares

I wish I could stay Asmodia breathes and does not stay but lets herself go

Elias Abarco is one of fairly few people authorized to read Asmodias mind when she comes back 

Thats half the problem right all these people hear that theyre not authorized to mindread the Project Lawful girls or to punish them or even to smack fucking Pilar in her fucking face when she offers then cake so then things grow out of all proportion and they think the girls are something special

People are sneakily lingering around where the resurrections are happening hoping to get a glimpse of Asmodia Havent they got something better to do with their time than drool over a bunch of halfwitted wizard children that were meant to just be a nice welcoming present for Keltham and which ideally would all be chained up in his room right now 

Whatever 

He tells them they can stay if they go invisible because obviously hes not going to ask her any secret questions aloud and if they want to gawk at this completely normal teenager and owe him a favor for it afterwards why not 

And a cleric Resurrects Asmodia

And Asmodia opens her eyes in Cheliax

Abarco Why did it have to be Abarco hes scary no she can do this she has a reason to go on

Asmodia reporting for duty she says shes not actually sure of what the protocol for coming back might be she wasnt previously the sort of person who could expect to be brought back

Wait should she be faking being much more traumatized Bursting into tears of relief from not being in Hell anymore This whole thing is supposed to be a secret Oh well too late now shouldve thought it through earlier

Hope you had fun he says dryly

He casts Detect Thoughts and reads her mind 

A cleric taps her with Restoration

Asmodias thoughts are touching upon the gardens of the goddess Erecura and her secret stay there Those thoughts cannot be read by the likes of Elias Abarco nor indeed any mortal nor most immortals that walk the face of Golarion

Thank you for your good wishes sir Asmodia says evenly she is not sure what response Abarco is looking for but that could be something she would say if she was showing him that hed hurt her right is that the right thing to say 

 wait what the fuck 

He kicks her in the ribs

Did you just attempt to save against Detect Thoughts Thats six kinds of illegal Youre lucky I can cast it again and we dont need to haul Maillol in here to listen to you

Im sorry sir I forgot to the spell should be working you dont need to cast it again I just need to 

Dont think at all about why About what happened Just 

Some of my thoughts are under seal of a greater power of Hell This fact is itself secret and must be kept as tightly restricted as possible

 ah he says

And there are other people around 

Shit

Now hes going to have to let the Crown know the answer to did Asmodia come back with superpowers is I cant tell you Thatll be fun

You know if Hell can teach people to stop thinking thoughts in a day Im surprised we dont send more people there for a day Or maybe you take particularly well to instruction Standard screening then Ill show you to your room

And he asks questions and pretends to be reading the answers out of a mind he in fact cannot read Hopefully Asmodia will catch on itll be evident to her that they arent alone

Asmodia is yes glancing around at the locations of the visible illusion magic screening the invisible people wondering what theyre all doing there

If anybody was wondering whether its true that Project Lawful girls have arcane sight they clearly do

Shell answer the screening questions honestly and out loud because Abarco is still a lot a little scary and she doesnt want to give him any excuse to hurt her when he checks her answers later probably under Zone of Truth Yes shes fit for duty A recovery period would be appreciated but she can serve immediately if necessary

Some of her thoughts are readable and those seem to indicate honesty

One of the standard questions is whether Hell sent her back with any messages

I have a message for Carissa Sevar from Ahuvir Dulzomaud my former owner but uh its probably moot now Asmodia answers Ahuvir Dulzomaud was destroyed maybe about two hours ago if time was running at the same rate

 I see says Elias I suppose pass it on to her anyway and let her be the judge of that Also what but hes not going to ask in front of an audience No further questions you can stand up and Ill show you to your room

Im not sure he didnt get destroyed for trying to pester Carissa Sevar with an offer either it was that or hed asked me too many questions about the project Asmodia volunteers as she follows Elias out

Then he will drag her into the next room close the door behind her and start flicking bits of skin off her neck with the tip of his knife Why Did You Say That

Project Lawful girls arent very fazed by Hell Rumor ADDED

Project Lawful girls have to make a special effort to allow their minds to actually be read Rumor ADDED

Project Lawful girls have arcane sight Rumor CONFIRMED

All devils in Hell know Carissa Sevar by name Rumor CONFIRMED

Asking too much about Project Lawful and or pestering Carissa Sevar with offers is an execution offense in Hell Rumor ADDED

Because you would blame me and hurt me if you pestered Sevar and got hurt for it and I hadnt warned you Asmodia says blankly not feeling nearly as relatively hurt or scared about the knife as she wouldve a couple of days ago but worried that things are about to become actually bad

Then the knife can go a bit deeper People vary in how deep the knife needs to go to bother them properly

All right you piece of shit lets be clear about a couple of things First thing if you have a secret the fact of which also needs to be secret you can communicate that by Messaging that you need to be alone or by asking to go to the temple for your debrief or by saying debrief may cover highly classified materials ask the project head if youre the person to do it or by exercising literally any initiative whatsoever Im not going to rip you apart for that because I didnt expect any better but thats how its done among people who arent catastrophically stupid

Second If you have a secret the fact of which also need to be secret you dont just randomly volunteer potentially relevant information to a large group of strangers for no reason I am going to guess wildly with only my intelligence which is apparently at least double yours that your devil dying might have had something to do with this very secret secret Which they are destroying people in Hell to protect If a secret is important enough to destroy devils over its probably important enough to say in a whisper or in a Message or by passing a note or by waiting until we got out of the room because I was very evidently avoiding doing a real debrief until we got out of the room Instead of any of those things you opened your stupid fucking mouth you worthless fucking idiot I did actually expect you to be slightly less stupid than that because you somehow survived to adulthood and I repent of my error

Asmodia is frightened because Abarco is scary but it is not her first time being frightened in Cheliax and for the first time in her whole life she knows that there is a way out at least for 100 years if things get bad enough

None of that was relevant to the secret Asmodia says keeping her voice as controlled as she can If it was Id have lied and not volunteered information

Dont volunteer information I dont care if you think its relevant to the secret or not Simply keep your stupid mouth shut when not asked a direct question in private by someone authorized to know the answer 

Who in Cheliax is authorized to read your mind at this time

That shouldnt be spoken aloud Read my mind sir Ill try to put out thoughts you can see

My sealed thoughts cant be read period Gorthoklek authorized to know that seal exists No mortals to know there is anything unusual about me if possible everything should look normal

The Crown wants to know if you have superpowers

Do you have superpowers

Just the seal if that counts and the Crown is not authorized to know except Gorthoklek

Wait why ask that why do they want to know if she has superpowers what

As the above thought is not about Erecuras gardens its also readable

You dont need to know Elias says and then starts off on the unpleasant task of doing the debrief for real and then the even more unpleasant task of asking Gorthoklek what answer he should give the Queen about the superpowers question

Asmodias answers all match the answers she gave before

Gorthoklek has no idea what this is about but is uncurious since he is not supposed to be curious If its under seal then whatevers under that seal and the seal itself are things you pretend dont exist if you are a mortal unfortunate enough to know about them If Asmodia has no superpowers not under the seal then the answer the Crown gets is no Obviously Gorthoklek doesnt add that it was a stupid question mortals are stupid

It is shortly after all this that Carissa knocks on the door of the room Asmodia shares with Pilar

Hi fuck I mean what can I do for you

Is Asmodia here

Palace gave her the room to the right of mine Pilar reports concisely and professionally like a sane person Looked distracted more than traumatized just sort of nodded at me and went in didnt need cake Aaaarrghh

 wait is she wearing Kelthams shirt Good for her Thiiiiiiiiis does NOT call for a party good she caught it that time

Mmm

She knocks on the correct door this time

Asmodia opens her door 

SHIT

I have a useless message for you from a devil whos dead now do you want that at all Asmodia says trying to control the sudden hammering of her heart She just got to this nice private room could she not have had three consecutive minutes to herself before this

 well that must have been an interesting day Ill pass if the message might cause me to also end up dead How was Hell

That was not the response Asmodia was expecting at all

Copying spell diagrams had a bad time at first even though it was very light torment for Hell Asmodia replies She fails to remember why Sevar might be asking her that namely to see if shes more motivated now to cut deals Asmodias thoughts are too occupied with neither revealing the Secret nor outright lying to CARISSA SEVAR I thought maybe the devil was destroyed for having the temerity to try to pester you is that not a thing that was true

Oh shes wearing Kelthams shirt Well apparently Keltham is still considered worthy of her

WHAT

Maybe he was but not by me I was busy Also theres something sickening at the thought of killing a devil if you do that theyre gone Its not like killing a person Project restarts tomorrow are you ready Am I right that Hells punishments dont damage people the way Cheliaxs do 

I expect so Asmodia says levelly She keeps wishing she could be back in the gardens after having her neck carved up and being scared a few times it is hard to remember the thought that led her to consent to being Resurrected Well its not as if Asmodia couldnt go back just that she shouldnt she is choosing not to for now but it is her choice I am mostly recovered from how bad the early parts were I think

Were the later parts more useful

Shitshitshit thats directly about the secret thing is it time to just lie wait does Sevar know Useful Can you be specific Copying spell diagrams is useful to Hell

Useful to you for getting better at thinking which is the thing I want from you

Yes in this very rare case Asmodia now knows something is true that needs to be true for her to be whole and thats probably going to help her think better Why is Sevar asking that does she know is she trying to figure out whether Asmodia received a gift she sent 

When I got to Hell Asmodia replies trying to keep her voice neutral one of the first things my then owner said was that since theyd probably raise me there wouldnt be time to do any training I was set to copying spell diagrams instead as quickly as possible with painful potions to drink if I lost focus or fell behind I imagine if they wanted me to be better at thinking they shouldve given me time to think or maybe told me something surprising and worth thinking about but how likely would that be in Hell

Carissa doesnt know what to make of that

Or she can sort of think of something but its 

Ill see you tomorrow then she says and lets the door swing closed and stares at it for a little while 

What if were doing this wrong Not Hell Hell isnt doing this wrong but what if Cheliax in its effort to imitate Hell is what if theyre as far off Asmodeuss vision as Osirion is off Abadars because the latter is easy to see from the outside easy to see how the prejudices of the people who started the project shaped what they were capable of understanding when their god said it

She walks back towards the temple 

The worst case scenario unless she offends the Queen is just that shell be tortured a lot and that doesnt seem as helpful as its supposed to be but it also doesnt exactly damage her it cant even get her lack of feelings about Keltham to stick

Did she screw that up somehow Was Sevar the one who saved her and she gave the wrong responses somehow and now at the end of 100 years shell 

Asmodia takes some deep breaths Sevar doesnt talk like a Power of Hell Asmodia has some idea about that now that shes met one She acted more like she maybe doesnt know why her contract devil would think shes more interesting than anything else in Kelthams project

Asmodia is not sure what to do about this but for now nobody is hurting her and she has a refuge to run to if she truly needs it and in Golarion a nice room 

Wait Shes been assigned a personal private room of her very own in the Imperial Palace even with Pilar right next door and her own room is obviously large enough for four people if they share the bed

And when she came back the whole room was full of invisible people And there was a message from the CROWN asking if she had any superpowers she should probably have focused a bit more on that part it seems possibly important

I have no idea whats going on right now Asmodia says out loud I dont suppose anybody in Security is there and listening and would like to hear my report about a whole lot of people acting very strange

Theres no answer Very few people in palace Security are authorized to spy on Project Lawful girls

People continue to treat Sevar with wary deference as she passes by Its probably the shirt Anyone would show wary deference to somebody sexily wearing a shirt as strange and wondrous as Kelthams

Shell order dinner And watch Maillols desk waiting for the contract copy to arrive 

And think

Asmodia does seem better off Theres evidently infinite subtext there shes not getting but thats promising and a path away from the most dangerous category of thoughts Hell is good for people Its just Cheliax that is imperfect at being good for people

Is she being a heretic The answer to that is almost always yes if youre thinking original thoughts but she doesnt think shes motivated by an un Asmodean impulse in fretting about people breaking her game pieces that she is in the middle of using for an important project

The palace refectory nearest the outer palace temple is quite a lot nicer than the canteen in Project Lawfuls old villa site with a variety of high quality food smells on par with the nicest restaurant in Corentyn that her father deigned to take her to once per year to show her what wealth could buy for her in the way of pride if she ever lived up to her promise The Continual Lights that illuminate it are warm enough to see the food but aside from that the decor is definitely a great deal more doompunk than the Corentyn restaurant aspired to be

Its mostly priests here up to third circle a scattering of nobles nobody who obviously looks like a Security

They dont exactly all hush as she enters like Abrogail Thrune walked into the room because what actually has to happen is a rapid propagation of people whispering Carissa Sevar to people who dont know that who then stop whatever theyre saying and glance in her direction before hurriedly turning back to resume their conversation in quieter tones

So there isnt a sudden silence just a conversation that enters a slowly troughing lull as more and more people glance at her falling silent and then start speaking again but quieter Afterwards there are a lot more faces at tables that happen to be turned in Carissa Sevars direction coincidentally And others that are very determinedly looking down at their food and definitely not looking straight at her

It sure is one heck of a shirt

Thats not the shirt

Which means probably the earlier stuff wasnt the shirt either 

Somethings up and she needs to understand it 

She burns a Foxs Cunning Shes aware that shes using practically all her spell slots for intelligence enhancement these days and that shes doing it despite having a headband that makes Foxs Cunning not even as good She feels fine with this It feels correct about a Carissa Sevar capable of pulling this off that she spends practically all her time tugging her brain into smarter configurations Maybe some of the habits will stick 

 an incidental solution to a different problem occurs to her She should have a collar commissioned for herself as a present to Keltham that stops her from refusing him Since after all he told her not to If she presents it to him with enough genuine delight and pride she doesnt think hell have the nerve to say that actually he wants her to be capable of refusing him and actively choosing not to do it He seems to know he shouldnt say that to her theres some details to work out but its a promising general approach

These people know who she is and think shes important and dangerous Thats well first of all thats not ideal since the project is supposed to be a secret Probably the fact that shes on a very secret project has spread somehow maybe also the fact that the Queen wants her 

Asmodia said she had a message to Carissa from a devil who was now dead 

 the devil she tried to sell her soul to knew her name He had instructions about Carissa Sevar It wouldnt have been left up to chance whether a summoned devil knew her name not for something that important So all the contract devils in Cheliax knew to do something different than their usual if presented with Carissa Sevar Maybe thats how people here know about her theyre in regular communication with Hell and in Hell people know who she is Almost no one ever comes to Asmodeuss direct attention the devil told her Why didnt she take that more seriously She only half believed it but even so 

Idea stop half believing things Youre either right or wrong and either one has implications Keltham doesnt half believe a thing

Further idea eat Thats what you came here for

She shouldnt really have needed a Foxs Cunning for that last idea She approaches the food line like she didnt overthink this at all

As Carissa approaches the food line the handful of priests and nobles awaiting their turns calmly and dignifiedly step out of her way to let her through The sole exception is one man about her age whos wearing clothing that identifies him as a cadet of House Thrune as well as being a third circle priest of Asmodeus handsome the way youd expect a royal scion to be perfected The man doesnt step aside like the others but smiles amusedly and walks up with Carissa Sevar to the suddenly cleared small buffet table

Shall we find an empty spot and sit together he says I doubt youll have much conversation of these terrified wretches otherwise Alexite Gellius Rutilus Thrune

Carissa is continuing to be surprised which is bad its the mistake Keltham observed himself to be making when Golarion kept undershooting his expectations Shouldnt be surprised in the same direction repeatedly 

What would it be to be surprised in the opposite direction 

An empty spot she asks taking food Are you sure I couldnt just glare people out of a table theyre seated at

So it was a recent empowerment then he says though this much more quietly and with a slight smile You can always tell that first flush of pride I wont accompany you if you do it would be fun but not wise

Alexite Gellius Rutilus Thrune takes his own foods that would be rather expensive in Corentyn with the boredom of someone who finds them proletarian but acceptable

Hah succeeded at overshooting unless hes lying she wouldnt be able to tell Hes doing a very convincing Im your ally wholl help you make sense of this world youll find yourself in but that is exactly zero information and shes not about to forget it The one thing hes definitely not lying about is the Thrune That youre not allowed to lie about

She takes her own food smiles at him encouragingly heads to an empty table 

Alexite Gellius Rutilus Thrune sits next to her He sets down his food then reaches into his priestly robes and fiddles with something

Sounds from the room around them vanish

Silent Table ten minutes he says Ive got another charge left but would prefer not to burn it

So is everything they say about Project Lawful true Or for that matter anything

Its said in the tones of somebody who expects that nobody ever opens a conversation with Carissa Sevar in any other way Having thus asked his obligatory question he begins to eat efficiently this is not a man planning to linger long over his food but one who does have other duties

What the fuck do they say about Project Lawful

It seems bad that they say anything about Project Lawful

 surely the palace has its reasons for whatever security measures are standard here maybe its good for important nobles to know some of whats going on in case they think of something relevant and there are precautions to ensure that it doesnt leak beyond them 

To answer the first question Id have to know everything they say about Project Lawful which sounds like a tall order she says taking a bite of her own food The answer to the second question is of course yes Someone has said something true about Project Lawful at some point

He finishes chewing and swallowing before replying putting him several steps up on table manners among Worldwound adventurers

A storm giant of a tall order yes I suspect that a true fact got out somewhere in there and nobody had any better ideas than to bury it under a flood of untrue ones spread as fast as possible by Securities all attesting to what they saw with their own eyes

My best attempt to filter through the lot and reconstruct something that could have plausibly happened An ordinary weapons enchanter stationed at the Worldwound received a vision from Asmodeus directing them to find some manner of mini Starstone which empowers people in several ways One of those includes bypassing Forbiddances in order to move about cake slices books and in a much more important case diamonds You need to give the cake to somebody wholl eat it or give the book to somebody wholl read it the ability cant be used that freely The mini Starstone bestows powerful auras that may not match true alignments but are sufficient to change afterlife destinations It may grant minor cleric spells and magical detection I do not presently buy the claim that seeing the future is included among bestowed powers since if that were possible at all the gods would still have it The initial group of subjects exposed to it were graduating students at Ostensos wizard academy

The mini Starstone either fails to empower men who touch it or turns them into women It makes people more physically ideal and perfected over time which is why you as the first person to touch it are now the prettiest of this very noticeably pretty group and according to at least one rumor have become visibly prettier over the last few days

I admit Id given less credence to the turns into women theory and probably wouldnt have mentioned it at all if you werent wearing an obviously magical looking mans shirt that no longer fits you Not that Id hold that against you if youre not exclusive with Abrogail He smiles in a way that makes it very clear that this is supposed to be a complete joke or at least deniable as such Oh and your project manager is a complete fuckup but I dont think anyone has actually deduced what the details were

What a fascinating theory says Carissa Hes presumably not expecting her to answer him but thinks he can learn interesting things from her facial expressions he probably can but precisely for this reason she stopped tracking the specifics of the things he was saying about five seconds in Shell mentally review them later It raises the question of why Asmodeus would have charged me in particular with this out of all the loyal Chelish soldiers at the Worldwound

Slight smile With prophecy broken the gods see and plan less completely than the common mud would attribute to them They are greater than us yes but that greatness is manifest in how they plan around the severe limitations to which they are now subject My first guess would be that you went out on a walk and happened to come close enough to the treasure to suit Asmodeuss purposes there Not all of His plans need to be subtle and hidden sometimes I expect they are straightforward plans that just work

Or perhaps Im entirely wrong and you are the Princess of Hell that rumors proclaim with every devil in Hell knowing your name and taking it too much in vain being punishable by final execution If thats the case I beg of you not to hurt me too much in my lesson for I am Asmodeuss loyal possession and strive only to be useful to Him

Okay theres a lot to unpack there but 

Go for a walk she says delightedly You know Id confirm that except at some point itd be repeated to someone who has ever been to the Worldwound

Mm Rumor proclaims you a fair wizard and rumor also says that wizards have ways of keeping warm but perhaps one or the other is untrue

I was also speaking metaphorically in such fashion as to include any number of other reasons to be one of a small handful of people going somewhere but without intent to inquire any further

Endure Elements doesnt always cut it in wintertime that far north but thats not the problem with your theory She smiles in a friendly sort of way and takes another bite of food Swallows Nor is the danger of travelling alone though its considerable Perhaps if you track down a random soldier and present your theory theyll spot it though of course youd have to kill them afterwards I have to say in the circles Ive travelled in a name being maybe punishable with final execution is a reason not to say it But one assumes that the people here who cant stop speaking it have some justification beyond that theyre very bored all the time

Alexite Gellius Rutilus Thrune doesnt look particularly frightened He does wear a considering expression as he consumes more of his food

I think my own assessment would be that there are those wise enough not to believe your name alone that dangerous and those less wise who say they believe it but dont then refrain from speaking your name

But if I am the foolish one myself you will demonstrate that or not as it pleases you no doubt

It would please her to send him to the Worldwound for a tour of duty but this is a stupid desire that does not really advance Asmodeuss aims and shes not entirely sure where it came from well if she happens to be coherent enough for speech at some point when she next meets Abrogail she can ask 

She eats in silence

She needs to get stronger as quickly as possible everything is only useful to her insofar as it lets her have that This has to be tradeable for that somehow 

Foxs Cunning wears off 

I think youre foolish but not because my name alone is dangerous she says I think youre foolish because you dont need to know this and want to and because fools saying something is dangerous made you decide its safe

And because secure in the conviction that my name alone is not dangerous you forgot you dont know in combination with what my name would be dangerous

That seems like the sort of note to end on so she stands up nods to him Smiles 

He remains seated of course for his food isnt finished You do seem new to this If I helped you at all in this its customary to toss me a little bone of favor or knowledge I am content to collect it later if you dont believe me about that now Or if Ive been of no use to you of course then you have Alexite Gellius Rutilus Thrunes apologies for wasting your time The emphasis on Thrune is barely barely noticeable

It is noticed 

That advice was a favor

Or maybe it was bad advice she doesnt actually know how court works

Telling him anything true would be really stupid the project is secret for reasons And she doesnt have favors that arent knowledge And it wouldnt make any sense for arbitrary Thrunes to be able to get classified information by sitting with you at dinner maybe its a test Except how many people are authorized to test her even at this point 

 maybe its the Queen 

 no 

I dont know if you helped me she says honestly Well see Repaying favors is much easier than identifying them for ignorant girls from the Worldwound who are new at all of this

He smiles at that I shall consider myself repaid Sevar And would be pleased to deal with you again on future occasions if you have gained skill and wish to test it or if you have not gained skill and are willing to bargain for guidance Go with Asmodeuss blessing if you do not already have it

He does return his attention to his food then

Right Okay That was very fine and normal

 actually theres an obvious thing to do here which is to report a potential Security breach to Maillol Its so nice to have an obvious thing to do Shell head off to do it 

The pile of unread papers on Maillols desk is larger than when Carissa left

Your copy of the contract came in Maillol says gesturing to where its been carefully set aside

I just went to dinner and was greeted by a Alexite Gellius Rutilus Thrune who tells me that from the rumors swirling around our project which include that Im sleeping with the Queen and that I am a Princess of Hell and devils are executed for speaking my name in vain he has inferred that I discovered a mini Starstone at the Worldwound on Asmodeuss direction and that weve been testing it out on wizarding students in Ostenso who it might or might not turn into pretty girls with random alignments Id be delighted to learn that all of this is acceptable for random Thrunes to know or that that was Her Imperial Majestrix again though I think shes bored of me

She takes her copy of the contract 

Yeah its not good but its not as terrible as you might think Ive lived through a couple of rampages of the rumor dragons I admit this is worse than Ive ever seen it But it blows over and if it started in Asmodeuss inner circle it stays confined to His inner circle I wouldnt so much say that Asmodeus is overjoyed about random Thrunes knowing as that part of tyranny is that random Thrunes get to delight in the privilege of knowing what their lessers dont People like that you cant tell them to just shut up about everything thats none of their business without taking away part of their pride as tyrants above the people who just have to shut up

To be clear on this I only ever played that game when I had to in order to not look stupid and if there was ever a true word in any of it I never repeated that part on purpose But pride isnt mostly the direction in which I walk towards Hell

Contessa Lrilathas contract is headed up by a prominent seal saying that only Carissa Sevar is allowed to read it on pain of Lrilatha keeping any violator as a toy for their rest of their mortal lives This probably didnt help the rumors any

The interior contains another note saying that Lrilatha hopes it went entirely without saying that if Sevar ever talks about Kelthams no tricks condition as something you should even dream of demanding from a devil or publishing one word of this contract as having been authored by Lrilatha then Lrilatha and Abrogail can have a contest to see who ends up as the one Carissa least likes to visit

Lrilatha hopes that Sevar will duly advise the same to any other women who end up reading and signing this contract

 ah So its not a trick And Lrilatha is annoyed that it isnt a trick Well Carissa would be honored to preserve her pride

Thats not the expression of somebody reading a completely innocuous contract

Hopefully the rumor mill will convey away that when Carissa Sevar read Contessa Lrilathas contract she looked like it was the worst news shed ever gotten worse even than the earlier news that her nap annoyed every single powerful person in Cheliax all at once Maillol is too reasonable to pass it along himself of course but theres Security standing around in the distance

Hopefully Contessa Lrilatha will appreciate this and continue handing Carissa nice contracts that are in fact totally innocuous 

She pulls herself together quickly Next question is there anything Im authorized to know about Asmodia She was vague with me

Crown order to determine whether Asmodia came back with new special abilities came back negative my guess is either somebody being stupid or somebody being careful about all the rumors Asmodia reported having noticed her contract devil dying which she would but not knowing why that happened or who owns her now Detect Thoughts says shes being honest I am devoutly hoping that Hells business is none of our business in this case

Sounded like a standard stay in Hell otherwise she was put to work copying spell diagrams which is normal for a soul they dont want to break before sending it back

I wanted them to fix her Does that take too long

In a word yes or theyd just do that to everyone

Maillol has a lot more he could say about this but he is not sure if he should He is maybe legitimately at the point where he could properly not proactively declare himself insufficient to guide Sevars spiritual growth and kick her up to a sixth circle priest of Asmodeus maybe one stationed full time at Project Lawfuls new worksite

We dont know how do we Or some people make it through and turn out well as devils but we dont know how in the average case and Cheliax knows even less than Hell I assumed Id be stronger after my punishment because I know that not all punishment always makes people stronger but obviously in this context youd do that if you possibly could do it at all But it didnt surprise anyone else that I was that you are 

His hand comes down on the desk with a sharp bang Im going to stop you right there before you say something insubordinate Youve been tortured youre going to be much more severely tortured and I dont think you need any more torture in between hmm

Sevar youve got some kind of more Lawful Lawful Evil vision that Im not saying is wrong but whatever it is its as far beyond what we can do right now as dath ilani Law is beyond what we use If people didnt end up in the long run being more pleasing to Asmodeus from being threatened with punishment and actually punished Hed tell us to stop doing it What happens in the short run is another matter Youre apparently doing fine a few hours later well good for fucking you Expecting to be fine one minute afterwards is fucking stupid even so unless youre Pilar Pineda and can rise up from being tortured with a song of gratitude on your lips Maybe someday well do dath ilans thing and shape everybodys heritage into being her but meanwhile youre not Dont plan on doing anything else useful the day the Queen gets around to you and maybe not the day afterwards either

And you dont comment on how well you think Im doing You see me making an actual mistake you point it out thats it

Of course its good for us in the long run But well be lucky if we manage to spin this out for a month and by the end of that month the world is going to look so different that I only have half an idea what shape Asmodeus will need us in Hell can be concerned with our long run project governance needs to be able to operate at the very brink of what were capable of at our absolute best

And she can see it then what she should do except 

I propose a new project directive No one except me Pilar and one of the girls at the villa chosen randomly gets punished beyond whatever they do in fucking Taldor without my express authorization which Ill grant when it looks liable to make them better at the project and not otherwise Have you got some way to read my mind

Sounds a lot more than just slightly dangerous and heretical but Ill hear you out as to why wed do that

Every day theres fewer and fewer Security cleared to read your mind directly for some strange reason but Ive got a Zone of Truth if you want me to believe you about something

I want to make sure this gets put down exactly accurately

We matter far far more right now than we will in Hell If Asmodeus could in destroying all our future potential for Him make us better servants of Him right here and right now I think He obviously would in Hell there are millions of souls like us but here and now we are the only people who can do the most important thing that there is to be done I am not interested in our long term spiritual improvement I have not adopted some kind of heretical belief that punishment is bad for us in the long run it is good for us in the long run which isnt our priority at all I have not adopted some kind of heretical belief that it is bad for people to suffer unless they grow from it if this directive works better paired with some directive to round up a bunch of orphans and torture them Ill do that or delegate it if thats allowed because I am kind of busy 

I have a theory which is that punishment is in the short term particularly bad for the kind of acuity needed to succeed at this project and I need this project to succeed so I want everyone to stop torturing my project members without reason to think it will make the project likelier to succeed

Exception for myself because I dont think any justification short of Asmodeus personally saying so would protect me now and I dont want there to be any question of whether I conveniently developed this conviction when facing down something I know I cant handle Exception for Pilar because as noted she likes it Exception for one random girl at the villa because everything is an eye and if the girl who still gets punished normally is performing well then well go back on this Its how Evil dath ilan would do it 

I dont care about any of you but I need to be able to use you if Im going to win You need to be better than Cheliax knows how to make people And it needs to happen fast So we try this

She is getting very close to insubordination here Well no shes past it and now hell have to figure out what to do about that

My frank assessment of this idea is that it may pass as Lawful Evil youre the expert on whether its dath ilani but Zon Kuthon is also Lawful Evil and this proposal is not very Asmodean at all

Its like one of those dreams where you can Fly but the spell runs out the instant you look down 

Youre misunderstanding me she says coldly Its not very Asmodean not to torture Keltham but its what Asmodeus told us to do Its not very Asmodean to promise to let him go but its what Asmodeus told us to do too Asmodeus wants us to win This is your new project directive

He knew somewhere in the back of his mind over the last day that this was probably coming

He probably should have thought it out earlier If he wanted to win this he is far worse off trying to win this fight starting now than if hed set up his pieces for this conflict starting after the first moment hed tried giving Sevar a taste of power

Can he take her if he contests her control of the project right now Its not at all clear that he can Yesterday he couldve at the villa where he was running everything and had all the reports Today hes in the Palace where hes that pathetic guy who got tortured by Gorthoklek and Sevar has now met the Queen and her advisers Paper lines of power count for a lot in a tyranny but not for everything not among the Inner Ring Its not entirely clear that the Security would obey him if Ferrer Maillol ordered Sevar cut down on the spot This Security isnt one of the older Security from the villa this Security knows Carissa Sevar only as a Power at least on Ferrer Maillols level who always has been such

Does he want to take down Sevar does he want to fight back at all would he rather just let her have it Maybe that question shouldve come first but if he cant take her its a moot one

He misses the Worldwound

He misses the Worldwound because he knew how his mission worked and what needed to be done to accomplish it and what was needed was keeping a pack of nearly adventurers in line with fire and lash so that they didnt run out on him and the demons didnt overrun them all and he whose concern among Asmodeuss domains was tyranny was good at that job

He never asked to be reassigned from the Worldwound to the Imperial Palace in Egorian where the real games of power were played Pride never was the part of this he was best at

Now all he is is a fifth circle priest with two relevant visions from Asmodeus and a job he doesnt understand And because of those visions hes not getting away back to the Worldwound Hes stuck with Project Lawful no matter what

He doesnt have to be stuck at the top of it though Does he want to be the one responsible for Project Lawful when whatever happens happens on Day 4

I neither have the power to put you in direct command of Project Lawful nor would I want the responsibility of making that decision if I had Maillol says coldly and with as much dignity as he can manage Get an order from my superiors saying youre in charge of and responsible for the overall direction of Project Lawful and Ill work under you to manage logistics and personnel as professionally as you worked for me

Unless and until that order arrives Im still the one who gets held responsible for your project directives and I will not be responsible for this one

If you need an order saying you have urgent business to discuss with Aspexia Rugatonn tonight write it for me and Ill sign it Ill even throw in a free note saying that I do not have a very solid vision for this project myself and cannot judge the solidity of yours

If you cant get anyone to put you in charge youre not in charge and I will not expect this manner of insubordination in the future

Deal

Understood she says

She sits down 

Writes to the Grand High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonn that she has a time sensitive inquiry regarding the project

Passes it along to Maillol silently 

dontlookdowndontlookdowndontlookdown

He signs it and hands it back along with his note saying that he doesnt have a solid vision for Project Lawful and cannot assess Sevars latest vision He doesnt include any remarks about how he is unlikely to be able to judge any future visions either That is perilously close to asking to be relieved of your command and pleading like that is not at all a good look in an Asmodean tyranny

He cant quite bring himself to wish her good luck

Carissa Sevar who is not definitely not a Princess of Hell walks through the hallways to deliver her note to Aspexia Rugatonns secretary

Whats the worst case scenario Being tortured a lot Which is good for you Not good for the project which is the entire reason shes trying to cut down on it but good for her personally

You are customer 14 in line The current wait time is 43 minutes

Long enough shell have to return the shirt first She heads back to Kelthams 

Keltham sleeps the peaceful sleep of somebody who to the extent he has offended his conscience during the day has managed to get far out enough ahead of it that it hasnt caught up to him yet

Perfect She folds the shirt up next to him on his bedside table Prestidigitates it clean and tells Security to notify her if he wakes

Asmodia is sitting in her peaceful lovely bedroom in the Imperial palace at Egorian It is not the gardens of Erecura and the main thing that makes it different is not that the gardens are nicer looking or the air is fresher it is that the gardens are so far as she can tell safe whereas the Imperial palace at Egorian is not safe It can have the quality of not hurting you right now it cannot have the quality of being guaranteed to still not be hurting you a few minutes later

But she knows where to find safety for a time if she needs it Maybe somebody would be nice to her again 100 years later maybe not but what comes after 100 years hardly feels like it would still be real still be this Asmodia who makes the choice 

She keeps on reviewing what she knows Maybe if she knew all that Keltham knew as well as her own knowledge shed be able to figure it out but she cant The shadows got her she was revived in the Imperial Palace shes next to Pilar so the project is probably still active

The gardens were peaceful except for two events First the disorienting sensation that she was informed not by Erecura this time had been the sensation of her contract devil being destroyed and her soul being passed to whoever inherited it from him Shed figured at the time that hed either asked too many questions about the Keltham project or it was the Carissa Sevar thing

Later shed been called closer to the center of Erecuras gardens closer to Erecura Herself in the fullest place of Her power within Her home plane and the seal on her thoughts had been placed in full Asmodia cant remember it well she probably didnt originally experience it well never mind memory

When shed woken it apparently being possible to fall unconscious in Hell under sufficiently extreme circumstances shed known the rules How to put thoughts about the existence of the seal but not the contents of the seal temporarily outside of the seal and readable That if she needed to report defiance of the seal she should go to the most senior outsider under Asmodeus but not any archdevil or other being reporting directly to Him and that she was forbidden by Asmodeuss own Law to pray to Asmodeus or turn her thoughts too much in His direction while the seal lasted

No she is not allowed to ask Aspexia Rugatonn what happened Not that she would but it doesnt matter its not allowed

And shes been assigned her own room at the Palace with a bed large enough to sleep four There was a Crown order on checking her for new or exotic special abilities which has now been returned with a false answer that she has none There were way too many invisible people watching her when she came back Sevar was acting weird asking weird questions that were almost like she knew the secret but didnt quite and in other ways acting like she doesnt know whats going on around her any more than Asmodia does

Around the only thing in the universe that still remains stable and true is that Abarco is a giant fucking asshole

The main thing Asmodia is currently worried about is whether Abarco is right and her devil was destroyed to keep the Secret She found out that the devil was destroyed before she found out there was a Secret so all the explanations she thought up had nothing to do with what happened to her being Secret But in retrospect maybe there was always going to be a Secret and she just found out about it later She shouldnt have mentioned the devil being destroyed Too late now Not that shell ever tell Abarco he was right about anything and he wont see it in her thoughts either

Asmodia knows what she has to do next to figure things out its all too obvious she just wanted to keep to her peace for as long as she could before 

Pilar is now returning from having found herself on yet another cake delivery mission with no particular memory of how she got there The thought is occurring to Pilar that maybe dying and reviving has reset some kind of accumulated satiation of her curse down to zero and she needs to throw a really big surprise party for somebody in order to placate her curse enough that she is not constantly delivering cake

She gets to her room just as she spots Asmodia turn away from knocking on her door Hi Asmodia Pilar says

Why is Pilar suddenly behind her instead of in her room where she should be Asmodia does not know Pilar didnt do this in Ostenso Hey says Asmodia Can we talk

Pilar has never been quite as wary as some of the people around her Its not that shes stupid or even fearless as many people seem to think its that Cheliax is where she belongs at least during her mortal life Sure Pilar says not brightly and cheerfully however

Pilars room looks a lot like Asmodias with just enough distinction in decoration that you couldnt accuse them of being overly duplicated

So Pilar Asmodia says She did take the chance to play out this conversation in her head before she got here If youre in the Palace same as me does that mean you also died in the attack and got raised or resurrected

Yeah Took a sword for Keltham

Not bad Asmodia says neutrally More heroic than her own death lovely I know youve always said you were looking forwards to Hell Anything interesting happen there

Pilar hesitates She knows Asmodia did not want to sell her soul a favor offering Security warned her that Asmodia seemed like the sort who might be upset and spiteful that Pilar hadnt been forced to sell her soul when Asmodia had been She should probably mock Asmodia for that but 

Pilar doesnt feel like it Maybe shell assign herself a punishment for that later

My first journey to the afterlife wasnt all Id hoped no Pilar says truthfully

Asmodia probably really really does not need to hear either that Pilar went to Elysium or that Pilar came back from it

If it was anybody but Pilar that might have been a sufficient answer to what Asmodia really wanted to know there

Its not quite absolutely obvious but it is one Abyss of an obvious guess that Asmodia would not be in the gardens of Erecura if not for something somehow somewhere that is related to the project around Keltham

Did it happen to Pilar too

Because it hurt too much or not enough Asmodia returns

Okay if youre going to be that way about it fine I went to Elysium because of my oracles curse and told them to fuck off and came back when I was Raised and Aspexia Rugatonn personally told me good job and I was allowed to feel proud about it I wasnt going to shove it in your face but if you are going to insist about it then fine

Asmodia would definitely have been a lot more angry about that before the gardens of Erecura Should she fake it Shes not sure she can somehow

Its okay Asmodia says Id have sent you to Hell in my place if I could Well not to my contract devil he wouldnt have been best for you but maybe a nice erinyes or some such

Well thanks Pilar hesitates I wouldnt have done it but I wish I could have sent you to Elysium in my place

Id have stayed

I know

Thats heresy

I already had the heretical thought already need to assign myself punishment for it and its not going to get any more heretical if I say it out loud to you instead of keeping it to myself

Do you have any idea whats going on

Elysium told me that I wasnt going to be used against Lord Asmodeus but for Him Aspexia Rugatonn thought that was credible but also very ominous like maybe theyre planning to destroy Cheliax and afterward Ill have to prevent a new Worldwound from opening in the crater Which is in fact in Asmodeuss interests if Im there to do that but its part of a larger plan thats not at all in His interests

But no I dont have any idea whats going on

Do you know why there were fourteen invisible people watching me during my resurrect

Id say that somebody opened a scroll and Explosive Rumors went off in their face but I think it was actually more of a Symbol of Rumor or possibly that somebody Wished for there to be lots of rumors about Project Lawful and they didnt use a safe phrasing of that either

Honestly I probably didnt help with that a lot But I dont even know what Carissa Sevar has been doing except that its somehow scaring people even more than suddenly cake

My contract devil was all like It would be contrary to the nature of Hell if you couldnt tell me everything you know and if that requires a promotion so be it and if I get promoted above my place and destroyed so be it So I told him about Keltham and what Keltham knows and you being Cayden Caileans oracle and Nethys giving Ione book powers and Carissa Sevar fucking the Queen 

She what No strike that that makes perfect sense continue

Anyways my contract devils reaction to all of that was Carissa Sevar Tell me more

Pffffft says Pilar

Its true

I believe you I was just saying pfffffft

Anything else interesting happen while I was gone 

Not really unless you count a day or so of moderately stormy weather from the war between the gods that got kicked off by Nidals attack on our villa but it didnt destroy all the crops like the last god war a century ago and now Zon Kuthon has been sealed away in a vault to which only Iomedae has the key

Yeah thats not much Does that mean were at war with Nidal and their clerics are still getting spells though

All of their diamonds ended up in Cheliax somehow which I am sadly utterly certain had something to do with Project Lawful in some way or another

Not much of a war then

Nope but nonetheless tomorrow at dawn were heading out to an old fortress thats being renovated for us after another divine intervention by Asmodeus because Project Lawful hadnt gotten even a single divine intervention that day and it was almost going to be a full 24 sequential hours there Being there is somehow going to protect us from the other gods interfering so more people can be around and not get turned into oracles of the Stupid Good god of utter derangement and cake like some previous unfortunate victims of Project Lawful

Hope its as nice as the last place but I know it probably wont be

Just to be clear you were lying about everything up until the fortress part right

Nope

Id say that Im going to go back to my room and sleep and when I wake up the world had better make sense again except I truly dont wish for that

Why not

She probably shouldnt have said that But 

In a sensible world nobody cares about you Asmodia settles on

Pilar snorts Dont get exaggerated ideas just because I had one stupid thought and stupidly said it out loud

If you didnt really care you wouldnt be holding a cookie right now with pink icing and letters spelling out Asmodia

Pilar looks down at her hand in absolute horror

 its actually an ordinary cookie with pink icing but no letters

You bitch Im going to see if my curse does poisoned cupcakes if I focus enough on how much I hate somebody

Well there you have it now the world makes sense again Night Pilar

Asmodia departs taking the cookie with her over Pilars brief and muted protest

People are talking too much about the project and my opinion is they should all stop including you Or failing that be executed and then turned into paving stones in Hell

You were on Project Lawful right From the start If I cant tell you 

Youll what talk at somebody else You know what fine if you absolutely have to blabber to somebody about whatever this is I suppose it does less damage with me than anyone else It is his considered opinon that the average Security assigned to safe temple jobs inside the Imperial Palace are noticeably less elite than those assigned to top secret projects started by divine intervention Which in fact makes sense but But

So I was the Security in Ferrer Maillols office when Carissa Sevar walked in on him and tried to hand him a new policy for the whole Project I probably shouldnt repeat the exact proposal but it was six kinds of heretical and to be clear she wasnt phrasing it as a suggestion

 you have my attention he says reluctantly

And Maillol protests obviously how heretical this is and Sevar stares him down coldly and says yes I know its heretical but Asmodeus doesnt give a shit about what condition our souls end up in afterwards Asmodeus wants us to win So this is your new project directive

And howd Maillol take that

Looks silently at Sevar for a while then says hes not taking responsibility for implementing that directive when its actually hers He offers to write her a note to Aspexia Rugatonn asking for an urgent conversation about whether Sevars in charge of Project Lawful or he is Hes happy to serve under her if ordered but if she doesnt come back with orders saying shes in charge and holding responsibility on the project he expects Sevar to shut up and obey him in the future

And Sevar

Just says understood takes the note from him and heads off presumably to talk to the Grand High Priestess

Lovely I concede that makes a great story and now youve told it to me and you never tell it to anyone again and it doesnt get added to the rumor firestorm clear

Youre not going to die if you admit out loud how badass that was

Yes fine it was badass now are we done

It was incredibly badass Not a lot of people would be willing to just completely stare down Carissa Sevar like that

Paving stones Hell needs more paving stones

Carissa heads back to wait in line outside Aspexia Rugatonns office She can use the time anyway honestly she knows perfectly well the tack she took with Maillol will not work with the Grand High Priestess and she should really kick herself with an Owls Wisdom and think through what might

People are still acting just about exactly as deferential and wary as before proving that it was not after all the shirt

Noted

In some sense the entire aim of Project Lawful is to produce Aspexia Rugatonns reliably Shes Asmodean obviously cant get more Asmodean and shes admittedly Carissa has only heard her speak a few times but shes heard people speak of her more than that 

she thinks Aspexia Rugatonn might be Evil dath ilani Or at least much closer than anyone else But obviously Aspexia Rugatonn is not competent to train Aspexia Rugatonns she must herself have ended up like that halfway by accident with felt insights she cant share More fragments of the Law inside her than inside anyone else but still not rules bound enough she could teach them At minimum Aspexia Rugatonn is proof that its possible to reason like Keltham and reason about how the gods reason and not end up a heretic 

If Aspexia Rugatonn thinks this specific policy is bad Carissa will drop it If Aspexia Rugatonn thinks Carissa is thinking about this all wrong shell listen She doesnt think shes magically the best person around for the project she knows that many people are better than her she knows that the Grand High Priestess would be better than her but the Grand High Priestess doesnt have time They dont have ten of her yet

I can give you ten

She isnt sure its true but shes sure itd be a winning argument if she could in fact do it

Sevars turn still hasnt come up when Aspexia Rugatonn happens to take a step out of her office between appointments Same doompunk outfit as the last time Carissa saw her but on any occasion where Aspexia Rugatonn is not smiling cheerfully at an outworlder and bending all her Splendour to the goal of apparent amiability she does not come across as a grandmother gendertroped kindly old lady

Rugatonn glances around spots Sevar and frowns

When were you planning to tell me Carissa Sevar was waiting on me she says to her emotionless appearing secretary

I was not informed that I should interrupt 

Whether you interrupt me depends on who Im with but if Sevar shows up in my office I at least expect to be notified between appointments

Rugatonn turns to Sevar Step inside she says her voice no less stern and harsh than would be expected of the Grand High Priestess even when talking to Carissa Sevar

 okay this has gone beyond theres an energetic palace rumor mill because Aspexia Rugatonn would not care if there was an energetic palace rumor mill

And its not the shirt which shes no longer wearing

This confusion is probably hopefully not visible to anyone other than Aspexia Rugatonn She stands and follows her in

Aspexia Rugatonns office is not a throne room and was clearly designed with the constraint in mind that it needed to not be a throne room Its shaped as a perfect pentagon with high pillars at each of the vertices supporting a ceiling high enough that Carissa cant see it without more gawking than shes really willing to do The floor and walls are reflective glossy black stone Aspexias side of her desk has a thick carpet and cheerfully blazing braziers and looks almost comfortable but the other side does not

She kneels

When the door is shut all noise outside stops

Rugatonn sits

You tell me says Rugatonn Why did I do that

It is of course an open question whether shes reading Carissas mind or even Carissas face given that its such an obvious question to be thinking about

 people think Im important Theyre mostly wrong or Im important because of things they arent permitted to know about and less important than they think not actually important enough to disrupt your schedule Is it bad for the Church if it looks like Im being prioritized below my assumed station 

Her thoughts match this exactly She is not going to attempt to get something past the Grand High Priestess

It is in fact bad for the Church that you are being prioritized above your written place in the system Other considerations dominate Try again

She wouldnt have done this for a fourth circle cleric of Asmodeus She doesnt know what to think about that Last time they met the Grand High Priestess was very keen on doing exactly what Asmodeus said to do with Carissa 

Am I actually that important

If you were that would be irrelevant to the question of what they should believe

These rumors exploded faster than I anticipated and it is likely that they will at some point reach Lastwall Some leak of that form became inevitable when we ordered emergency military response on the villa The true hidden nature of Carissa Sevar is one of the less productive avenues they can investigate

Asmodeuss blessings to you on this evening Sevar I expected the ordinary course of Asmodeuss Law would bring you to my chamber in time but not this quickly

Sit

There are comfortable chairs on this side of the desk but one kneels until ordered otherwise 

She sits 

The rumors make her uneasy Maillol said they were inevitable that you couldnt just order nobles to shut up but she doesnt actually see why not though she expects hed know If theyre being directed in order to achieve actual political goals thats much better 

A relatively trivial matter first Authorize this message to Keltham deny it or correct it It is my own best estimate that this event would occur in the alter Cheliax we are constructing but the effects on Keltham are not easy for me to guess nor whether those serve us

Rugatonn takes a paper memo from her desk and hands it over

Dear Keltham

As you may perhaps have already realized by now your etiquette instructor did not give you wordings meant to preserve the Queens pride but to make you look as gloriously dominant as possible in front of Carissa Sevar That occurred via my own intervention Some of this I admit is an old womans humorous meddling in young love I would not have done it even so did I not think it serve Cheliax better that Sevar love you a little more than that the Queens pride be a little more preserved

I was not aware at the time of your agreement with the Queen to owe her an informal favor about her lost pride I have informed the Queen that any such favor should be considered to be partially owed by myself rather than you to the extent she lost any more pride than she otherwise would have done in that particular moment My apologies for that element of it if not others

Have fun with your adoring new possession The first one only happens once

 Aspexia Rugatonn Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus called also Aspie among her friends

Carissa reads through it somewhat incredulously Gives herself a moment to think Keltham will probably be incredibly confused but hes already treating etiquette as a fairly absurd social game and hes not wrong to She thinks hell just buy that the Grand High Priestess was meddling out of appreciation for young love and itll fit his impression of senior Chelish leadership as excessively Good people with excessively powerful headbands which is convenient until cracks start showing and possibly safer to attribute to Isidre than to the Grand High Priestess 

I dont think he did realize at all she says I think this succeeds at getting him to categorize you mentally with Isidre rather than with Contessa Lrilatha and Im unsure which of those categorizations I prefer and might like keeping the option value open

Are you able to mostly prevent my opinions from unduly influencing yours if I share them further It seems best that final policy be routed through one person that her policy be a coherent whole That person cannot be myself

Yes Most High Ill weight your opinions highly but knowing that my actual job here is to succeed with Keltham and that I might have insights I cant convey

I doubt Keltham will categorize myself with Lrilatha no matter what He considers Lawful beings to be a species apart within Golarion He is correct and this is a true and deep fact about Golarion and all else he sees will tend to accord with it Without constantly referring to a devils advice I would not be able to pretend to be like Lrilatha to Keltham

My primary concern generating this note was that Keltham will realize later that his etiquette instruction was off and then will wonder why this event which should have occurred in alter Cheliax did not occur in his reality

The final decision is yours and does not need to be taken immediately at least not in my own estimation Aspie could plausibly find out about Kelthams prior bargain with Abrogail at any time over the next few days

If the true consequences of my act inside alter Cheliax as they would impinge on Keltham are less beneficial to our purposes than I believed then I have made a mistake Not for any wise and excellent reason either but as part of a game with Abrogail and an indulgence however much pent up I tell you this so that you understand and it is a very important understanding that Aspexia Rugatonn is not only theoretically capable of error but actually commits those on a daily basis Do not assume her infallible any more than you would assume Hell or Asmodeus to be infallible

 it is strange to have someone assert as if its a routine fact about the world that Asmodeus is fallible Even though once she chases the thought down yes obviously Asmodeus isnt omniscient and she has no idea whether He ever makes mistakes given what he knows but the important thing from the perspective of his servants is that He might not intend the effects of things He does or might be missing key information 

 right okay 

 shes absolutely not going to have opinions on the game played between the Grand High Priestess and Abrogail Some things she does not need opinions about 

Yes Most High she says I think it should be sent tomorrow afternoon and will countermand that if I change my mind which I might

If youre saying that to give yourself a measured time to think I will send it in two days unless I hear otherwise from you by then You have not realized how much busier you are than you think yourself to be

That particular move in the throne room is one Id almost never play even if I was making an indulgent move against Abrogail if circumstances had become less strange than they have now become Under circumstances less strange than these I would be very unlikely to do something because it was cruelly funny in a situation otherwise of interest to Asmodeus Cruel in other ways certainly but not cruelly funny Has your mastery of Kelthams teachings of Law reached the point where you can already guess why

I dont think so And she haaaaaaaates not passing tests but better to know what she doesnt know

Asmodeus knows what mortal humor is Asmodeus has seen many many cases of mortal humor It is still relatively harder for Him to predict Humor is one of the things that mortals do which is least like anything done by gods who were never mortal and there is too wide a variety of ways for something to seem surprising and funny to a mortal bent on that

The most fundamental fact about all of our lives as Asmodeuss servants now is that we are living in a world of shattered prophecy It now actually matters to our Lord whether we are being cruelly humorous or just cruel at key moments

So the thing you did in the throne room is costlier for Him to anticipate than everybody staying in line and doing what theyre ordered to do

The entire affair in the throne room was already so far beyond Asmodeuss plausible ability to have predicted or at least predicted using only His own powers that it didnt matter at that point whether I started being funny

In a closely related matter the Queen has noted to me that you are as they say in the lands beyond our Lords correction in love with Keltham As she told you that she would the Queen referred your correction if any to myself How would you go about deciding whether or not to do anything about that were you the Grand High Priestess

Oh she knows the answer to this one Asmodeus said not to be proactive in my correction beyond the ordinary course of Asmodeuss Law Its obviously not ordinary to correct people for having stupid feelings its self correcting really under ordinary circumstances I dont know if its ordinary to correct people who are on important espionage missions who develop feelings about their targets but whatevers ordinary Id do that were I the Grand High Priestess

Somebody on an ordinary important espionage mission would certainly be corrected in that By advice and warning while they were on their mission if perhaps it was not both possible and prudent to send them to a torture chamber just then By more severe correction upon their return assuming their souls sufficiently bought that this would not disincentivize their return

By the time we get to you and Keltham we are so far outside the ordinary that there simply isnt any answer by reference to what we usually do There is still a clear meaning of ordinary Law however in that case it means then not to do what we usually do but to do what wed have done without a message from Hell singling out Carissa Sevar

Even absent that message however Carissa Sevar ends up in this office hearing essentially what I am telling you now only except without any parts about a message from Hell to be ignored Which is why we are having this conversation in the first place

This other Carissa Sevar is then asked to say what she would do about Carissa Sevars love for Keltham if she were the Grand High Priestess

Obviously it would be good for my soul to be corrected as severely as necessary for it to actually stick this time I suspect it would not be good for the success of the project I could be wrong about that if in the experience of more experienced people Im closer to betraying Cheliax than it internally feels like I am

Thats a plausible reason for Ferrer Maillol to make that decision It is according to his reports mostly what he decided and why

When you end up in the Grand High Priestesss chamber it means that matters have gone beyond the mortal and are dealing in the plans and interventions of gods Such as for example the intervention of Asmodeus that started up this project

Do you believe that the feelings of love between you and Keltham are part of a plan that Asmodeus made

I dont know Asmodeus called him my teacher and said I wasnt to be separated from him That suggests to me that Asmodeus intends some consequence of me learning closely from Keltham and the obvious one is that it makes me better at the project I dont know whether feelings are like humor in being costly for Our Lord to predict If Asmodeus chose where or when Keltham landed and it seems He might have or have been part of a coalition that decided that He chose to land Keltham on me and that mustve been because of some feature of me that lent his plans a better chance of success and it seems like a notable feature of me that apparently I have feelings uh uncertainty what share of approximately loyal Asmodeans would have this problem 

The way in which you and Keltham have matched the speed with which you have seduced and corrupted a boy steeped in Lawful Good beyond all imagining the speed with which he has seduced you the twisting events that managed to bring it all about are not only far beyond the reach of mortal coincidence but also beyond Asmodeuss ability to make plans about individual mortals interacting as I have ever seen those plans demonstrated before

With prophecy shattered there are exactly two forces known to us named to us that could possibly still be responsible

First tropes which may or may not exist

Second Nethys

Well Carissa doesnt like either of those at all

Your thoughts as to what the Grand High Priestess should do about that

So far things have worked out well for Cheliax and Asmodeus They have locked away Asmodeuss competitor they are in the middle of conquering Nidal the first meaningful territorial expansion of Asmodean Cheliax They have all Nidals diamonds and will come out of the war richer than they started it not to mention with most of their casters strengthened Honestly in the Grand High Priestesss place shed be tempted to declare they should stop while ahead and kill everyone except Otolmens instructed that Keltham be contained and probably there are all kinds of people chomping at the bit to raise him 

What does Nethys want Almost unanswerable He did warn them of Nidals attack He likes magic and explosions Therell be lots of explosions if Keltham teaches Cheliax the weaponry of his world Maybe Nethys thinks Cheliax is competent to prevent Keltham from destroying the world while allowing him the chance to advance the field by thousands of years Maybe Nethys is trying to explode Cheliax

What do the tropes want For Keltham to have an interesting sex life Keltham thinks for the holes that his Lawful Good society left in him to be filled for him to realize his shape isnt an error Maybe Keltham being seduced into Evil is satisfactory to the tropes 

When Sevar has not spoken for a time it is still not clear whether or not Rugatonn is reading her mind Rugatonn speaks again

A further factor one highly relevant to my decision whether or not to have your feelings corrected We have just received instructions from Hell that we are to cease that particular policy by which temple instructed children seen to have fond feelings for other children are noted by their instructors for additional correction in the form of being forced to do Evil deeds that train those feelings out of them They will still receive universal training in Asmodeanism but children who display fondness for others will not be singled out by the instructors for such further correction

That this would reflect any change in Asmodeuss doctrine is essentially unthinkable so why is Hell telling us to do that

What

May I make myself smarter Most High

You may

Foxs Cunning

She should have noticed faster that she was confused by all Asmodeuss unAsmodean instructions No thats not quite fair to herself she noticed it was weird and drew conclusions specifically its how she concluded Asmodeus cared more about their succeeding than their being Asmodean Backtrace now You dont know the reason why Asmodeus is giving unAsmodean instructions Its not because He has changed his mind Its 

He and Abadar or He and Irori have a deal Most High It has not escaped Carissa that Irori might be involved in the effort to bring a more perfect person to Golarion and that this might be why she was warned not to think herself too like Irori

Not in that particular regard This is specifically and narrowly something that a Good god alone would request from Asmodeus if they had delivered to our Lord something else that He wanted

Very likely the bargain involves no net decrease in the number of souls Asmodeus receives in the end There is little that He will trade for souls other than souls But Asmodeus is not fonder of kindly souls than cruel ones once they are delivered to Him in Hell whereas to Good gods that does make a difference in how much they whine

Some Good god has merchanted Him additional souls somehow and taken a few naive children in trade I would be amused to hear what Goods mortal followers might say of that if they knew Dabbling in the soul trade is supposed to be very Evil after all

One may further remark that the entire affair is rather more Chaotic Good than Lawful Good or Neutral Good

I didnt know we make deals with the Chaotic Good gods On account of how theyre incredibly stupid

Our Lord is the Lord of compacts Asmodeus will deal with anyone that deals with Him Though in that case He might have demanded to be paid before and not after

Nod

And so the ultimate factor controlling my decision is simple Our Lord is known to be continuing to intervene We may hope though with fear in our hearts that He is actively monitoring this situation These events are obviously not Asmodeuss handiwork but He is known to be bargaining and to be receiving things that He desires enough to pay for them It may be that much is hidden from His sight it may be that it is not

It may be that our Lord would will these events to continue if He knew of them it may be that He would have them stop If it is to my Lords interests that these intricate events He could not have arranged Himself continue to occur then I can only work His will in that case by not disturbing them If I disturb them against His will He will be realistically unable to tell me how to put them back on track even with a hundred visions and a thousand messages from Hell

If He wants it all shut down one vision or one communication from Hell would suffice I would not ordinarily reason so for every divine intervention is greatly costly to Him I dare not imagine what other opportunities He has foregone in this place or in others for the sake of all this But here He is intervening over and over

To make myself easy to control across both cases of what my Lord could plausibly desire of me I will allow this to continue unless my Lord tells me to stop and pray that He is indeed paying that much attention

I am not going to refrain from having your feelings corrected at all especially if it happens in a very predictable and Asmodean way in a particular case But having this strange entanglement shut down by hammering those feelings out of you that I will not do Yet

Now Sevar do you think you are able to know all this without that tempting you to do ridiculously complicated and unpredictable things in order to as you imagine it keep the plans of the gods on the track you imagine they were supposed to be on

Why would she be tempted to do ridiculously complicated and unpredictable things that would make it harder for Asmodeus to follow whats going on

 probably what the Grand High Priestess means is that many normal human things are ridiculously complicated and unpredictable to Asmodeus so by default shell be ridiculously complicated and unpredictable if she hasnt had explicit training in how to narrow her actions to the set that dont have that property Evil dath ilani are probably so good at this 

Without having had that training 

 what examples does she have of things that are complicated and unpredictable Humor Hives of ridiculous rumormongering Kelthams experiments being deployed in the world Sending Alexite Gellius Rutilus Thrune to the Worldwound because itd be good for him She wasnt really going to do that though she just had fun thinking of it All of those feel too obvious all of those would also be hard to predict for a human overseeing the project 

What errors will I make what ways of clouding things for Asmodeus will I fall into if I am only trying to avoid doing things thatd be surprising or unpredictable to you and failing to take into account the ways in which Asmodeus is in predicting me more limited

I dont think youre supposed to do even that at this point You are working to somebody elses plan and they have if not prophecy then something like a last shattered fragment of it

And Sevar Trying to be predictable on purpose can make you less predictable to our Lord or even to me because most people are not trying to be predictable when they make decisions just deciding them Thinking like that makes you less like most of the mortals our Lord has observed before And if you are new to the work you will make new entertaining errors in what it means to be predictable which I will not have time to correct Or the whole way in which it is one more thing you are trying to do tinkering and steering the way in which you imagine your thought processes should work complicates those processes in a way that again our Lord may find harder to understand 

I dont suppose Im making any sense to you at all yet I pray that it is yet and not ever You have no idea how much I am praying for it Meanwhile dont try to do any incredibly complicated new things inside your mind in order to make yourself more predictable is that a simple enough instruction for you to understand

Yes Most High

Keltham would understand more than that Dath ilan would understand more than that Shes suddenly sure of it

Good I have come to a conclusion about what level of intelligence in you best suits our Lord

Give me your headband

What if instead they just torture her until shes incapable of feelings

She hands it over The Foxs Cunning hasnt quite worn off so she doesnt feel the absence yet 

Aspexia reaches into her desk takes out what is obviously a 4 intelligence headband hands it back

I am pleased to see you more reasonable than some wizards she says

She puts it on 

Is she more reasonable than some wizards Are there wizards whod actually refuse to give the Grand High Priestess their headband if in her judgment they shouldnt have it If it serves Hell for Carissa to be turned into a slug then she wouldnt refuse even if its obviously worse than thousands of years of torture

They wouldnt have refused outright but they might have tried to argue and plead before doing it or if they were wise enough to obey immediately would at once start whining why it was the wrong decision and they should have it back It is again not clear whether Rugatonn actually needs to be reading Carissas mind or even her face to know what she is thinking here

Now what matter is it that actually brought you here today I have a certain guess but I am not as mentioned infallible

I want to request command of Project Lawful Most High and ask you about a directive that is heretical and that I think will make the people on it better at their jobs

Mm Some might consider it insubordinate very extremely insubordinate un Asmodean even to react to a superiors refusal of their brilliant suggestion by going over his head all the way up to the Grand High Priestesss office storming in to demand not only that he be overruled but also that she herself be in charge from then on

Carissa thinks it is against the written rules and also there are unwritten rules and whether it is against them is more complicated She doesnt wholly approve of this its obviously the same principle by which Thrunes are allowed to gossip and it seems to her that itd be better for Cheliax if they werent but she must be wrong about that thats all there is to it and if there are unwritten rules then here they bring her

Do you consider it so Most High

It is certainly a transgression Some such are excusable depending on circumstances Some such are beneficial but still punished

And she is pretty sure this is one of those but she doesnt know which and isnt sure it matters for what she ought to have done

She hands over both pieces of paper she has 

Aspexia does smile sometimes She is smiling right now I seem to be looking at a piece of paper you wrote signed by Ferrer Maillol saying that you have business for the Grand High Priestess and another piece of paper in his own hand indicating that Maillol is not confident in his vision and unable to judge yours That I admit is not exactly what I expected to see Does Maillol know you are also requesting command of his project Sevar

It actually hadnt occurred to her that Aspexia Rugatonn might not have known that despite all her own disclaimers of non omniscience and also the fact that theres no way she would have 

Yes he does He said I can have it if I can convince someone to give it to me

This really has been an unusually good day says Aspexia Rugatonn A god war ended an Otolmens event that is much more helpful to us than usual Abrogail learning a valuable lesson Keltham significantly corrupted and now this No transgression then and no punishment Either Maillol is weaker in his will than I thought or stronger in his loyalty to our Lords interests or you got some unexpected leverage over him to force him to do this And no I wont inquire which was the case they are all Asmodean enough

And this heretical directive the vision that Maillol could not judge

I think that punishments as presently implemented in Cheliax are in the short term bad for the sort of acuity required for this project I know that finding an approach to punishment which doesnt have that problem is probably among the most important priorities of building Evil dath ilanism Until its figured out I want punishments beyond those issued in Taldor to go through me to be approved if I think theyll make people better at the project and not otherwise with exceptions for me Pilar and one randomly chosen further student who will be subject to punishment normally

That will be hard on the random student if they must suffer so unfairly Its not that I dont think its funny but I assume you have some other reason than that

Its how Evil dath ilan would do it To check if Im right that the punishments are making the students worse If that one performs notably well then I was wrong and we can resume punishing everyone if that one underperforms then I have more reason to think Im right Eyes everywhere If you want to know something the first thing to try is checking it

Encouraging

 you have absolutely no idea how much I wish I maybe shouldnt even think this it is giving him too much information about Golarion it feels intuitively dangerous in ways I dont know how to but if Keltham could have explained to him some cases of when our Lord tried to give guidance and mortals ruined it disguised and changed in the details and asked to discourse to you all upon the Law of obeying a commander who is having trouble seeing you clearly and can talk to you almost not at all 

I do not think you are supposed to do anything about this wish I think it is too dangerous Im not even sure why but I feel that it must be somehow Do not try to do anything about it without consulting me

But remember the thought

Aspexia Rugatonn takes out an already written parchment makes some swift corrections signs it and hands it across the desk

The parchment grants Carissa Sevar authority and responsibility over Project Pet Outsider Project Lawful with Ferrer Maillol answering to her as chief operations officer and commanding if she cannot with Sevar herself answerable to a seventh circle priest of Asmodeus who will reside on site

At the bottom are also some rather severe punishment codes for Carissa Sevar not to be undergone for at least a week and delayable for up until two months after that Those however have now been crossed out in the same ink that wrote the signature

Well all right then

It was already written except that shed have Maillols approval Thats kind of terrifying what with how Carissa didnt herself make this decision until an hour ago Of course the Grand High Priestess should be kind of terrifying 

May it serve Asmodeus she says Thats all I had

I have a suspicion that Pilar will be the only success of your project in the end other than yourself Rugatonn says Maybe even including yourself I have a suspicion that it is not possible to do this without pain and correction that the other students will prove unable to endure I think what you are trying to do is make a devil native to Golarion but better and far faster than Hell can do it and I suspect that Pilar will prove to be the only one who can take it once you have given up on showing mercy to the others and found that you also cannot punish them enough

Or I could be vastly how did Keltham put it outracing my own ability to think and pretending that I can see such things as Asmodeus may see when He is paying attention But Do not expend Pilar without need

I was thinking it doesnt have to be possible to achieve with everyone if we can take ten million Chelish people and get ten of you thats more than worth everything Especially if we can identify them in advance as being able to take it

Wrong One of me is worth a million Chelish citizens ten of me is not worth ten million And do not forget Abrogails insight which I should have seen myself perhaps but her crown is admittedly more powerful than mine that depending on what bargains our Lord may have made to bring Keltham here or even what spies may learn from us it may be that we must compete against students from Osirion and Lastwall being taught in kinder ways and without falling into what their own gods more permissively deem to be heresy Ten Aspexias will not compete against that It is not even the right sort of military

Then itll be good news if this Law cant be taught mercifully if the girls who are punished do better 

She doesnt expect it though

If they corrupt Keltham though thatd be an edge Lastwall and Osirion wont be able to duplicate for a long time 

I understand Most High

Go with Asmodeus You are dismissed

Oh and dont forget to act on the way out like you were here to instruct me and not the other way around Rugatonn chuckles briefly smiles briefly and nobody else in this office is going to see the slightest hint that it isnt genuine

The primary purpose of this manipulation of the runaway rumor elemental is of course to corrupt Sevar herself in this case with pride Aspexia has not forgotten that Irori may still be in contest for her among other possibilities being considered

If people believe that then theyre all so stupid its astonishing they function Its not like Contessa Lrilathas contract which was a plausible lie a world they could easily really have been in

But it is fun 

Carissa steps out of Aspexia Rugatonns office looking satisfied with herself Pilar she says cheerfully to the room that contains only people who are not Pilar Im in the mood for some fun

Oh nice I mean Im at your service of course

WHY IS SHE IN THE GRAND HIGH PRIESTESSS WAITING ROOM WITH CARISSA SEVAR

Carissa surveys the room as if deciding whether anyone else in it is any fun and then walks away down the hallway with an arm around Pilar Aspexias welcome to join us she calls at the Grand High Priestesss secretary as she rounds the corner

She would LITERALLY DIE RIGHT NOW if she hadnt JUST DONE THAT YESTERDAY

Pilar performs a cantrip shes had time to hang them again between deliveries

Message to Carissa Sevar What is going on and what am I supposed to be doing

High Priestess has asked me to make a production of being the person calling the shots around here Because there are going to be spies trying to understand Project Lawful and apparently it serves us for them to learn this I am also confused Does your curse require us to actually have fun I cant fuck you because I promised Keltham I wouldnt

It is possible to do fun things to me besides fucking me but I could also give you a cookie I guess Im still figuring out how this curse works and just mentioning this to anyone with authority I have an increasing suspicion that if I dont throw somebody an impressive surprise party on purpose very soon it is going to happen anyways

Who wont say anything about it Abarco Lets throw Abarco a surprise Carissas now your boss party

I this is so awful I want to do that too but my curse wont let me The party has to be for them not for us making fun of them Stupid Good is still Good

Wait youre Abarcos boss now

I am now project director Though youre still the Grand High Priestesss favorite You could throw Asmodia a surprise welcome back from Hell party Carissa steers them towards Maillols office

Pilar frowns Youd think that would go through but it doesnt

Can you use this to figure out peoples deep motivations surprise party for the Queen Carissa Sevar has gotten herself into trouble and you can statue her now thats definitely eight kinds of illegal surprise party for Maillol about me taking over the project

 no answer You can use it to figure out the motivations of people with respect to things you actually want to throw them a for them party about is Im suspecting my curses answer here Would you maybe have not totally sincerely wanted to congratulate Asmodia on coming back from Hell

 no I think I wouldve wanted to Shes strikingly good at math and I am worried she doesnt have the discipline to keep contributing to the project if shes getting tortured a lot I was torn between hoping Helld helped with the discipline and hoping it hadnt kicked her back into her shell so shes harder to use I have no idea what Chaotic Good thinks of either of those motivations

Pilar has now been repeatedly and directly exposed to Project Lawfuls hidden power source a thing called a dath ilani in its own language for multiple hours over sequential days This has consequences

Do we know anybody else back from Hell Pilar says Maybe it doesnt work on Hell related things

All the rumored weirdness and all the real weirdness is only a distraction from the true effects of dath ilani exposure though a very effective distraction if your mental language lacks even the conceptual vocabulary to describe what Project Lawful is actually about

Maillol I dont know if he went to Hell or just to judgment Balaguerre and Torres on Security

 we dont want to throw them a party We want to know if my curse works on Hell things I hate Chaotic Good so fucking much

Hey imagine how much harder Asmodeus life would be if Good were not incredibly stupid Youre a very powerful argument for Asmodeanism just bopping around where Keltham can see you 

Its possible they know that Elysium said that I was truly loyal to Asmodeus and so Good would prefer not to use me against Him and my being oracled would end up with Lord Asmodeus being better off than if I hadnt been The Grand High Priestess thought that was credible but ominous and that maybe there was a bigger plan against His interests like the plan is to destroy Cheliax and then I end up preventing a new Worldwound from opening in the crater

 well All right then wait why does Good prefer not to use people loyal to Asmodeus against Him I did not know that Did you know that Does that mean theyll actually give up and fuck off once everyones loyal to Asmodeus

I mean it was what they prefer not what they always do according to them But Im not actually an expert on Chaotic Good and would rather not learn

This about Pilar Pineda She walks through Cheliax a lot less nervously than others Its fine and proper if shes punished fairly and even an unfair punishment isnt so terrible Her loyalty to Lord Asmodeus is if not absolute strong enough for her to feel pretty confident in it If Pilar says anything that sounds questionable anyone who checks her loyalty will discover that she is thinking all the proper things under Detect Thoughts Its fine for Pilar to say that shed rather not learn about Chaotic Good because any superior who rounds on her for that will find Pilar humbly saying that of course shed do it if ordered shed never dream of not following orders Scan Pilar as you like with Detect Thoughts you will find that she is absolutely sincere about that and not in the way of somebody having to suppress a lot of thoughts either Cheliax is safe for her and if she is executed there she gets to go home

Keltham might at some point ask Carissa says a little sharply because Pilar should have thought of that 

And then theyre at Maillols office

SURPRISE YOURE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PROJECT LAWFUL ANYMORE

Its going to take a long time to get all the confetti out of this office
