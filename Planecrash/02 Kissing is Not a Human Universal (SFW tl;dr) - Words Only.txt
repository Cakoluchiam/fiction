This is a safe forwork summary of the key events in kissing is not a human universal itself a subthread of mad investor chaos and the woman of asmodeus with intent to slightly expand the range of people to whom Mad Investor Chaos can be recommended Also for the benefit of people who would like to read all of the decision theory stuff Ive written without them having to read the whole sex scene surrounding that decision theory Ive tried to include all of the dath ilan worldbuilding any nonintrinsically naughty thoughts about thinking and of course Law from the original naughty thread

 Those of you who are questioning why a sex scene needed any discussion of decision theory at all see dath ilans reply appearing below to people who ask why libraries need secret passageways

As our story begins from Mad Investor Chaos Carissa Sevar has just kissed Keltham and threatened to steal his shirt

It turns out that dath ilan doesnt have exactly the same ideas about kissing Keltham gets through that by just mirroring what Carissa does since kisses are anatomically symmetrical They both survive the experience

Carissa invites Keltham to take his first step into sadism by biting her ear which he does

Carissa then mentions the fact that third circle wizards are tougher than mortals implying Keltham can potentially bite harder without hurting her

Keltham has Additional Questions about this and indeed Suspicions about just how likely that would be but sets them aside for later

The characters move to the downstairs bedroom

Carissa ponders whether she might push Kelthams sadism far enough that she might have to use a lot of acting ability to keep up with it

She concludes that since the other women shes competing are younger and will have an even harder time keeping up this is a good plan

Keltham removes his shirt introducing the following bit of dath ilani worldbuilding

Keltham taking off his jacket shirt is going to look strange to an inhabitant of Golarion not accustomed to overengineered dath ilani clothing

In principle one spends a lot of time in clothes and hence should be willing to spend some money on better clothes

In practice there is a certain element in Civilizations clothing choices of that dath ilani personality trait which always puts a hidden passageway behind at least one bookcase in the house library Often one that just goes around a short corner and exits from a different bookcase in the same library The point is the hidden passageway has to be there and if you ask why the people of dath ilan will smile and tell you to shut up

Kelthams jacket shirt assembly includes more technology than just zipper slides It has been painstakingly designed by a cultural accumulation over time of engineers with 4sd intelligence to among other things manifest a rainproof hood from no obvious receptable convert between warmer and colder coverage and be easy to remove from yourself while youre already cuddling somebody without having to disentangle yourself This easy removal feature makes good use of micro velcro fine enough to not be obvious from a distance and arrays of tiny rare earth magnets which automatically pull bits of fabric back together again in a correct stepwise pattern

From an outside perspective one would see Keltham tear his jacket shirt off of himself with an audible ripping sound and end up holding a jacket with no visible damage If you were watching closely enough youd see the jacket split along the seams and then quickly come together again along those same seams The way this registers from outside is not an accident or any kind of side effect of other design purposes A mad engineer who would detect in Golarion as INT 26 spent several years figuring out exactly how to do that and make it look cool subsequently collecting 0 1unskilled labor hour royalties on over 200 000 000 pieces of clothing

Carissa now really wants Kelthams shirt

Some additional sadomasochism occurs

Carissa starts wondering though she knows its optimistic if maybe Keltham also has desires with no place in Axis

Keltham tries doing some sexy things to Carissa

Carissa is faking all her responses in order to optimize how to appear to Keltham as one does in Cheliax which takes enough focus that it doesnt leave her room for much in the way of real sexual response

Keltham has some training to read subtle bodily responses that Carissa doesnt know how to fake because its the sort of thing that seems cool to learn when youre a dath ilani teenaged male Her micro responses dont match her macro responses Keltham wonders without saying anything whether its his reading of Carissas micro responses that are broken or the responses themselves It doesnt occur to Keltham that Carissa is faking her responses in order to manipulate him but the fixed overt presentation blatantly rhymes with the Permanent Cheerfulness of his students if his ability to read her isnt just broken Without saying anything Keltham tries some experiments to narrow things down

Carissas subtle tells continue reading at low no matter what Keltham tries

They change to Carissa doing sexy things to Keltham

Keltham challenges Carissa to a sexy game

Carissa says that she bets she can do it

Those words have only one possible meaning in dath ilan

 Namely actual betting Theres no colloquialism of I bet to mean I believe

In the course of discussing betting terms Carissa says

 So I could name terms along those lines she says but I feel obliged to note that a symmetrical bet like that seems very dath ilani very Neutral not even a little bit Evil and relatedly that it does not sound like you named anything that you really desperately want

Subsequent discussion escalates to the point where it has pretty thoroughly interrupted the sex

Key snippets

Keltham

 But I dont understand what you mean by saying that a symmetrical bet isnt Evil You bet because you expect to win Maybe some people arent like that in the cuddleroom but I sure am I mean what version of this practice is asymmetrical Evil instead of Neutral

 You cant just mean what that we pick something with even odds and bet an hour one way against two minutes the other way Wouldnt that be less Evil for you even if it was more Evil for me Taking things without giving in return isnt that I mean isnt that a smaller version of Abaddon basically

Carissa

 I am here I am not here because I calculated how much pleasure I could get out of you and how much inconvenience I would be buying it for and in fact came here without any particular expectation that dath liani sex is pleasurable to Chelish people though it does seem to be actually I am here because I want you and part of what it means to want you in the terms I learned insofar as its safe and reasonable and all those other things is to want to put myself in your power and witness what you do with it to strip away every conventional arrangement for how we ought to relate to each other to stop calculating whether its been long enough or fair enough or reciprocated closely enough to emerge whatever you choose to make of me And the difference between us and Abaddon is that I knew what I wanted and came here to do it chose this and chose you in pure selfish curiosity about what youll do with me and where Ill be after that And if your terms arent fair I can walk away if Id like but I can also not walk away if Id like And theres nothing of Abaddon in a bet we both agree to with our eyes open for our own reasons even if it gives you everything and me merely the satisfaction of having that to give you

Keltham

 Were taught that theres always an exchange one way or another and that we have to acknowledge whatever that exchange is to make sure its a fair one

 If I knew you better or maybe if just understood Chelish people Id already know what you were expecting from me in this in whatever were doing which is something that I dont even understand if were not trading pleasures with each other which I mean some people enjoy the act more than others it doesnt mean that what theyre doing isnt valuable

 I can tell Im in the wrong frame for this new thing that were doing but I was raised among people who werent Evil enough and I dont understand what the really Evil thing to do here is Part of me is fascinated by the idea of you giving me things and you being rewarded only by the satisfaction of giving them to me but wouldnt that make you Good

Carissa

 Its not resistant to analysis but you cant do it at all by trying to make sure the other persons getting their duly negotiated share of the value being produced you will destroy all the value being produced if you try It runs on Evil emotions let loose in a context where it is safe to let them loose on the power that want has when its not held in check by all the things that have to hold in in check almost every minute of all of the time it runs on from the other end the ways that it changes you for the better to stop looking out for your interests and discover where they fall when you arent protecting them

Carissa also mentions that sex games can involve giving people orders they cant follow in order to punish them and deliberate unfairness

Boy howdy betsy booyah is Carissa using some ideas not natural to the conceptual language of dath ilan

When Keltham was very young indeed it was explained to him that if somebody old enough to know better were to deliberately kill somebody Civilization would send them to the Last Resort an island landmass that another world might call Japan and that if Keltham deliberately killed somebody and destroyed their brain Civilization would just put him into cryonic suspension immediately

It was carefully and rigorously emphasized to Keltham in a distinction whose tremendous importance he would not understand until a few years later that this was not a threat It was not a promise of conditional punishment Civilization was not trying to extort him into not killing people into doing what Civilization wanted instead of what Keltham wanted based on a prediction that Keltham would obey if placed into a counterfactual payoff matrix where Civilization would send him to the Last Resort if and only if he killed It was just that if Keltham demonstrated a tendency to kill people the other people in Civilization would have a natural incentive to transport Keltham to the Last Resort so he wouldnt kill any others of their number Civilization would have that incentive to exile him regardless of whether Keltham responded to that prospective payoff structure If Keltham deliberately killed somebody and let their brain soul perish Keltham would be immediately put into cryonic suspension not to further escalate the threat against the more undesired behavior but because hed demonstrated a level of danger to which Civilization didnt want to expose the other exiles in the Last Resort

Because of course if you try to make a threat against somebody the only reason why youd do that is if you believed theyd respond to the threat that intuitively is what the definition of a threat is

Its why Iomedae cant just alter herself to be a kind of god wholl release Rovagug unless Hell gets shut down and threaten Pharasma with that Pharasma and indeed all the other gods are the kinds of entity who will predictably just ignore that even if that means the multiverse actually gets destroyed And then given that Iomedae doesnt have an incentive to release Rovagug or to self modify into the kind of god who will visibly inevitably do that unless placated

Gods and dath ilani both know this and have math for defining it precisely

Politically mainstream dath ilani are not libertarians minarchists or any other political species that the splintered peoples of Golarion would recognize as having been invented by some luminary or another Their politics is built around math that Golarion doesnt know and cant be predicted in detail without that math To a Golarion mortal resisting government on emotional grounds Dont kill people or well send you to the continent of exile and Pay your taxes or well nail you to a cross sound like threats just the same maybe one sounds better intentioned than the other but they both sound like threats Its only a dath ilani or perhaps a summoned outsider forbidden to convey their alien knowledge to mortals wholl notice the part where Civilizations incentive for following the exile conditional doesnt depend on whether you respond to exile conditionals by refraining from murder while the crucifixion conditional is there because of how the government expects Golarionites to respond to crucifixion conditionals by paying taxes There is a crystalline logic to it that is not like yielding to your impulsive angry defiant feelings of not wanting to be told what to do

The dath ilani built Governance in a way more thoroughly voluntarist than Golarion could even understand without math not only because those dath ilani thought threats were morally icky but because they knew that a certain kind of technically defined threat wouldnt be an equilibrium of ideal agents and it seemed foolish and dangerous to build a Civilization that would stop working if people started behaving more rationally

The Taldane word punishment translates into Civilizations conceptual library as a technical concept for a structure that should never appear in reality not just the punishment itself being kept out of reality the threat of punishment is something that shouldnt appear in the actual counterfactuals

So giving someone orders that they cannot follow so you can punish them for failing to follow them doesnt make any sense even assuming the actualization of a counterfactual threat structure because punishment is by technical definition something that appears in threats which if theyre being deployed sanely are meant to work in a way where the naive agent obeys in actual reality and therefore the threatening agent doesnt have to expend resources on carrying out the punishment in actual reality so why would you purposefully give somebody orders they cant follow that doesnt even make sense even in the world where threats work on people

And thats not even getting into the math underlying the dath ilani concepts of fairness If Alis and Bohob both do an equal amount of labor to gain a previously unclaimed resource worth 10 value units and Alis has to propose a division of the resource and Bohob can either accept that division or say they both get nothing and Alis proposes that Alis get 6 units and Bohob get 4 units Bohob should accept this proposal with probability 5 6 so Aliss expected gain from this unfair policy is less than her gain from proposing the fair division of 5 units apiece Conversely if Bohob makes a habit of rejecting proposals less than 6 value units for Bohob with probability proportional to how much less Bohob gets than 6 like Bohob thinks the fair division is 6 Alis should ignore this and propose 5 so as not to give Bohob an incentive to go around demanding more than 5 value units

A good negotiation algorithm degrades smoothly in the presence of small differences of conclusion about whats fair in negotiating the division of gains from trade but doesnt give either party an incentive to move away from what that party actually thinks is fair This indeed is what makes the numbers the parties are thinking about be about the subject matter of fairness that theyre about a division of gains from trade intended to be symmetrical as a target of surrounding structures of counterfactual actions that stabilize the fair way of looking things without blowing up completely in the presence of small divergences from it such that the problem of arriving at negotiated prices is locally incentivized to become the problem of finding a symmetrical Schelling point

 You wouldnt think youd be able to build a civilization without having invented the basic math for things like that the way that coordination actually works at all in real world interactions as complicated as figuring out how many apples to trade for an orange And in fact having been tossed into Golarion or similar places one sooner or later observes that people do not in fact successfully build civilizations that are remotely sane or good if they havent grasped the Law governing basic multiagent structures like that

Carissa continues to attempt to explain that she is trying to give herself to Keltham to do whatever he wants with her

Keltham

Again that sense of standing on a narrow ledge and not being sure whether Carissa is trying to stabilize him or push him off it

 I youre right that theres a part of me that wants that wants it a lot and I keep wanting to say that its like being offered a an apple for free without paying for it who wouldnt want it except that I can tell its more sexual than that and deeper and darker and maybe dangerous but but how is it okay How is it all right with you I keep wanting to check that youre not expecting more equity or the rights to the fasteners in my shirt or but you sound like youve done this with other sex partners it seems so so valuable to give that to somebody if you didnt charge for it at all even in nonfinancial ways then there should be many many more people wanting it then people wholl supply it and I dont understand and yes I know it shouldnt be something I need to figure out to have the sex itself but it doesnt feel safe to grab something so precious and scarce whose scarcity has to be rationed somehow without knowing why I get it when not everyone gets it because that reason whatever it is is the price

 Lit factor that varies to equilibrate supply demand in Baseline but unfortunately this more technical and general term has just translated right back into price in Taldane

Carissa

 I think its pretty balanced actually in supply and demand Cheliax has philosophy about parts of yourself you discover through pain through obedience through not having choices Some people hear that and think well that sounds false of me or try it and its false of them but but its true of lots of people about as many as there are people who discover something in themselves through sadism itd be neat for me if I were offering you something very precious you could otherwise stalk half the world looking for even with all your money but if you ask the class in the morning youll have three volunteers She mentally considers the girls in the class youll have five but three who know for sure theyre into it This would be overconfident if she didnt have the power to order the girls in the class to not ALL VOLUNTEER FOR KELTHAM TO TORTURE THEM HE WONT THINK THATS PLAUSIBLE

Keltham asks himself why hes scared of trying this when he clearly wants it and finds

Keltham smiles for he sees the humor in the situation though he doesnt know if Carissa will find it humorous at all

 Well I just got an interesting answer from my mind when I asked it why I was scared of something I knew I wanted Apparently I really dont want to disappoint you by missing some key requirement on my performance that youre not thinking to mention and then youll never offer me this again Apparently even if three other women here offer it to me Im attached to getting it from you in particular I have no idea how youll take that but it seemed like the sort of thing I ought to let you know

Carissa

Carissa has not encountered that level of being emotionally vulnerable at someone on purpose presumably its on purpose since she was eight and another child told her that their dad died yesterday as if they expected sympathy for this She corrected them by saying cheerfully you look it you have a dead dad face and then when the kid merely looked confused like if I were your dad I would die of how stupid your face looks This got the message across and Carissa does not think the kid even said it to anyone else and got beaten for it so really she was doing him a favor

 anyway So far I have found all your miscommunications very endearing I think I will enjoy watching you get better at this even if you are very bad at it starting out And its doing it more wrong to want it and do something else you arent actually avoiding doing it wrong that way

Keltham

 Havent actually noticed that internal phenomenon with any other women before I suppose it requires respecting somebody to some noticeable degree further snippet redacted And here I thought I was just aromantic ha ha I wonder if Civilization has a secret effort underway to cure people like me out of existence or just try to make sure we have fewer kids so our descendants wont be running around needing something that dath ilan can never give us

Carissa

asexual was doesnt actually do sex aromantic is doesnt actually do romance

Is he Saying that he is falling in love

Well that was one of the objectives so good job on that objective Carissa Are such declarations accompanied by snuggles It seems like maybe they should be She will stop leaning over him and curl herself in at his side

During subsequent discussions Carissa again hints that she intends to acquire Kelthams shirt

Keltham replies that it is HIS SHIRT and he considers that part to be SERIOUS BUSINESS

Keltham also mentions since they havent resumed activities yet that hes been trained to read subtle tells and that so far as he could tell they all continued to read low arousal no matter what he tried doing to her hes not sure if that means he cant read women who havent been trained in dath ilani baseline training for women or what exactly

Carissa

Whats an explanation thats not oh I was really hoping I could just fake it And not yeah thats Chelish girls unreadable which itd now be her responsibility to coordinate everyone on that Which seems hard Its its the same problem they ran into earlier right Keltham pulling apparently magical correlations out of nowhere because his society shelves entirely different things alongside each other and not actually I really dislike experiencing pleasure which isnt even true but feels kind of true right now and not oh that was my badly behaved unsexy body double

Why is her life LIKE this

As few lies as possible Only she doesnt even know what the relatively fewer lies route from here is because they are standing in a LIE MINEFIELD

 this is the way a stupid failure who gets executed a week from now thinks not the way that the girl Asmodeus noticed thinks calm focus good lies are personal therefore nondisprovable Good lies expose vulnerability because people dont expect vulnerable lies and because if you know what someone thinks your vulnerabilities are youre safer

Snuggle Thats on me not on you I think I was enjoying myself but its hard for me to relax enough to get off when I dont feel like I understand handwave whats going on If its safe for me to stop tracking things Its not actually safe to stop tracking things very often at the Worldwound And uh it Is physically much safer here but its also very confusing I am curious whether youll have this problem with anyone else but my guess now is that you wont and it is just that I am too on edge and need to relax

Keltham

Keltham hugs Carissa closer to himself Its an honest reaction of course hes not going to start faking things that would be a sign something had gone dreadfully wrong with an equilibrium if people acted fake in that way then Carissa would be expecting the fakery and if they dont then hes not going to be first to defect etcetera Keltham is moved and feeling empathetic suffering as one would expect what with Carissas story being more awful than anything youd almost ever hear in dath ilan where the news coverage tries to be statistically representative of how often things happen in reality

But Keltham is also concealing another thought one that seems not especially helpful to speak right now which is about the way that Carissa made sexual sounds despite her low objective arousal It blatantly rhymes with the Permanent Cheerfulness he is beginning to suspect it is not dignity of his students

There is Keltham is beginning to suspect a kind of damage to the self that nonpsychiatrists like himself have never heard of maybe a kind of damage that approximately doesnt exist in dath ilan something like an illusion spell something like the Eagles Splendor spell something that unglues seemings from actualities Keltham suspects he intuits that the ungluing isnt just in the outer social world its not like a lie told to other people it reaches deep into peoples own selves It is a form of damage that dath ilani mental training protects against so thoroughly that he was never warned against it as a danger or maybe its a socially inflicted hazard that requires your society to be doing everything wrong simultaneously

Fighting endless demons at the Worldwound and that making you tense to the point where you have a hard time getting off during sex even after you leave well yes thats bad or even grimdark but its the ordinary kind of grimdark you would see in a movie or novel out of dath ilan The thing where you make noises like youre fine that seems very very very much worse in ways that Keltham is finding hard to describe That cannot possibly be something that would not damage a person nor a thing that an undamaged person would do

 he wants to find whatever did this to Carissa and unmake it

Ha Keltham has never felt that way about another person before It isnt limerence Keltham doesnt think it doesnt feel like descriptions hes read of limerence More like he owns equity in Sevar or or he doesnt even know

Hes supposed to set aside sad thoughts like this but Keltham can feel that he should not do so that quickly The current running through him now is deep not lightly to be told to go away and come back later Still he can at least not say any such things out loud If his Carissa is broken and doesnt know it he shouldnt ask about that or try to explain his hypothesis to her in the middle of sex under previously decided meta policy it should not be said tonight at all

Keltham

 I may need a half minute to recover Keltham says out loud Im afraid that I went and updated about how awful Golarion is again and I definitely needed to go there because otherwise I would have been too confused specifically during sex but still

Carissa

What in that could possibly have been an update

 Take as long as you need

Keltham

A brief smile Ill aspire to need as little as possible A saying out of dath ilan First learn correctness then comes speed

Carissa

 A saying that works here too I dont think Ive heard it but if I did I wouldnt guess at all itd be invented by aliens

Keltham

 Interesting How about If you know where youre going you should already be there

Carissa

 somewhat more invented by aliens I know where Im going usually means Im pleased with my afterlife arrangements and if they turn out to be dated to today then so be it but its not advised to run straight off to Hell just because youre supposed to get there eventually

Keltham

 Ha No thats not what it means in dath ilan at all Its the second discipline of speed which is fourteenth of the twenty seven virtues reflecting a shard of the Law of Probability that Ill no doubt end up explaining later but Im not trying it here without a whiteboard

 As a human discipline If you know your destination you are already there is a self fulfilling prediction about yourself that if you can guess what youre going to realize later you have already realized it now The idea in this case would be something like because mental qualities do not have intrinsic simple inertia in the way that physical objects have inertia there is the possibility that if we had sufficiently mastered the second layer of the virtue of speed we would be able to visualize in detail what it would be like to have recovered from our mental shocks and then just be that For myself thatd be visualizing where Ill already be in half a minute For yourself though this would be admittedly harder itd be visualizing what it would be like to have recovered from the Worldwound Maybe we could just immediately rearrange our minds like that because mental facts dont have the same kinds of inertia as physical objects especially if we believe about ourselves that we can move that quickly

 I of course cannot actually do that and have to actually take the half a minute But knowing that Id be changing faster if I was doing it ideally is something I can stare at mentally and then change faster because we do have any power at all to change through imagining other ways we could be even if not perfectly Another line of that verse goes You can move faster if youre not afraid of speed

 You seemed to think that the first layer of speed made perfect sense so I thought Id go try the second layer on you Though that may have been a little ambitious now that Im actually saying out loud what all goes into layer two

Carissa

 huh I think that might not be true until youve learned some other things for changing your mind around I bet its true for devils

Keltham

 Layer three is imaginary intelligence is real intelligence and it means that if you can imagine the process that produces a correct answer in enough detail you can just use the imaginary answer from that in real life because it doesnt matter what simulation layer an answer comes from The classic exercise to develop the virtue is to write a story featuring a character whos much smarter than you so you can see what answers your mind produces when you try to imagine what somebody much smarter than you would say If those answers are actually better it means that your own model of yourself contains stupidity assertions places where you believe about yourself that you reason in a way which is incorrect or just think that your brain isnt supposed to produce good answers such that when you instead try to write a fictional character much smarter than you your own actual brain which is whats ultimately producing those answers is able to work unhindered by your usual conceptions of the ways in which you think that youre a kind of person stupider than that

Carissa

 Huh I have not tried my hand at writing fiction but I would be really surprised if I had that problem One thing I like about wizards is that they are very very focused on being as smart as possible and getting as much out of your intelligence as possible and if there were a widespread phenomenon of people failing on some level to use all their intelligence which you could notice once you enhanced Wisdom or Cunning theres no way everyone wouldntve known that

Keltham

 Yeah lets try that again after all yall hear a remotely Lawful definition of what intelligence is

 I was wondering before if maybe the permanently cheerful students in the classroom are trying to imagine the version of themselves thats cheerful and act like that person in hopes of being that person Because when were being instructed in the virtue of speed were told that you can try that like once or three times to see if anything improves But if you kept it up itd be like They probably dont have artificial flavors here Using Prestidigitation to flavor all your food if Prestidigitation worked perfectly for that to the point where flavors were uncorrelated from actual nutrients and your body became confused in the way that it tried to seek nutrients by seeking flavors associated with those nutrients Fake cheerfulness until its real is something youd try a few times to learn how it helped if it helped Not a good way of splinting a bone long term to help it heal It wouldnt heal straight Or at least that was the standard dath ilani advice to a standard dath ilani person in my intelligence bracket But artificial cheerfulness meant to become real probably isnt the explanation for the permanent cheerfulness thing because if it was they could have just said so

Thats about the best veiled helpful advice Keltham can offer relative to the obvious possible reason why Carissa might be imitating all the sexual responses of a person who hadnt just gotten back from the Worldwound

Carissa

Carissa has picked up that theres subtext but isnt sure enough of what it is to be sure she can handle it cautiously enough

Keltham asks some further questions about how Carissa expects his sexuality probably works

Keltham

 What would you guess Im supposed to feel while Im having you making you experience what I want you to experience Its not infinitely safe to tell me what I should feel but Im guessing that its much safer than giving similar advice to a Chelish man my age Civilization ran me through a lot of exercises on not feeling something untrue to myself just because somebody primed me in the wrong direction

Carissa

 powerful Thats why its interesting at all right she has no idea how tyranny would translate to Baseline and doesnt want to risk it but this is clearly the thing her tutor possesses and she doesnt the ability to find Asmodeus here the dimension along which Keltham can be tempted except he couldnt learn it from someone else who experiences it he has to learn it from someone who can look him in the eyes and sincerely tell him that some people are meant to be ruled over that she would know that your wants are law that the only thing you have to think about is how youd like things to be

Keltham

Not quite right somehow Keltham thinks But its close enough that he can maybe see what his mind is trying to feel

 You talked about giving yourself to me to see what I made of you can you say another few words about that

Carissa

 There are lots of different kinds of devils And some of them are painful to become from a human shaped start not the way exercise is painful the way being whipped is painful and Ive wanted that since I first heard it was an option I want to bathe in a flame that hurts me but does not damage me and emerge perfected I want to suffer and survive and know things about myself from the surviving I want to let go of all the things I cling to as I try to keep the world under my control and learn what happens without them And I want to watch people transformed by power over me I want to see what they grow into when I am the raw material they get to use for growing I know that I will survive anything Keltham I think no one in your world has ever really had that And since I will survive anything I want to endure lots of things And you youre already remaking how I think what I see what I want I want to see what you do with me I want to learn how I emerge from it

Keltham

 Thats the way you feel about this is too far from any way my own mind works for me to understand I think though its helping on some level to know that you have an experience that makes sense to you

 You can be damaged even if you cant be annihilated Isnt it still a big deal if I manage to screw up on a level that damages you Even if its only for the rest of your preafterlife existence Im sorry I know on some level that Im asking questions whose answers from you should already be obvious that Im denying the frame and making you repeat yourself but maybe I need to hear it anyways

Carissa

Well seems like the devil bit went over okay That was the highest priority here

 so several things First I think you probably actually cant damage me for the rest of my preafterlife existence I recognize Id be more credible on this front if I didnt apparently have some kind of Worldwound related trauma but Ive been there for six years and Ill be astonished if I have trouble relaxing for a month And thats you know watching my friends eaten by demons in front of me and so on not getting hurt Second Im worried youre still reaching too much for a trade frame Which is maybe my fault for telling you what I like I am not trading you the right to do whatever you want for hopefully its a satisfactorily compelling experience for me and if not Ill wish I hadnt made the trade I am giving you the right because I have it and so I have the right to give it away to do whatever youd like

After some further discussion sex is attempted again somewhat more BDSM flavored than before

Keltham orders Carissa to hold still and plucks some of her body hairs dath ilan has mastered chemical control of hair Carissa hasnt heard of women removing body hair at all

Keltham

 For now he says softly this is as close as I know how to come to remaking you the way I want with pain

Carissa

She feels that inappropriate tothe situation burst of emotion again fondness and protectiveness and Carissa if you catch feelings every serious person in Cheliax will laugh at you while they put you to death

Sexual activity continues successfully this time without further distraction by things that are not sex

Theres a difficult challenge with one brief permitted wearing of Kelthams shirt as the offered prize which Carissa fails at

Snuggling follows
