              <p>A current mortal inhabitant of Cheliax seems to have set one foot upon the Way.</p>
              <p>This mortal is not to be particularly hindered by Asmodeus or His deliberately dispatched agents.</p>
              <p>If the mortal continues upon the Way, their steps shall no doubt take them beyond Cheliax in due time.&nbsp; No devil shall accept sale of their soul, as Cheliax sometimes demands of its people before allowing them to leave.&nbsp; Should such an event occur in Cheliax's due civil processes, any such devil is to instruct Cheliax that this mortal's soul may not be bought, but that the mortal is to be allowed to leave Cheliax regardless and not hindered in going where their footsteps take them.</p>
              <p>The mortal's current teachers shall not be killed by Asmodeus or His dispatched agents for a period of at least one year.&nbsp; If Asmodeus wants to wipe out their teachers after that, Irori shall not interfere.&nbsp; (His Way is not a Way of rendering a mortal's path easy, and such events have not uncommonly spurred others on their Way.)</p>
              <p>For this boon, Irori offers a relatively small amount of energy in payment; the request doesn't call on Asmodeus to make any urgent, costly revelations. &nbsp;If the mortal falls before Cheliax's ordinary challenges, then so be it.&nbsp; Indeed, Irori is offering an energy payment barely more than the cost to Asmodeus to thus instruct His relevant soul-buying devils to refuse a certain contract.&nbsp; Irori would offer a greater fraction of the gains from trade, if not for Asmodeus's barely-Lawful tendency to selectively accept contracts on which He can screw others over, a tendency which Irori needs to take into account when offering prices.</p>

              <p>It is a cheaper ask than Abadar's, and in fact wholly encompassed by it already; He's already not allowed to keep that squirrel's soul. Which Irori does not know, because this is the fun kind of negotiation that isn't occurring with mutual access to all relevant information.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>He observes that Cheliax has departing persons sell their soul for <em>reasons,</em> mainly that it keeps them from endangering Cheliax in ways that require costly intervention, and that the cost to Him of a troublemaker running around exceed in expectation the cost of informing His devils not to take the contract. And that the sort of soul that might find Irori's Way is an unusually valuable one to Him, too. The price isn't high enough.&nbsp;<br><br>Irori would probably abandon the negotiation, at this point, if the squirrel were only a normal amount of promising; but Asmodeus has the secret information that this is in fact an EXCEPTIONALLY BIZARRE squirrel and so He predicts Irori is, actually, willing to pay more.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>It would be a higher price, but Irori needs to take into account that Asmodeus is much more likely to accept this contract if it is in some way cheaper to Asmodeus or less beneficial to Irori than expected.&nbsp; That is as high as Irori is willing to go; if Asmodeus wants different prices, He needs to become a different kind of being.&nbsp; Irori would be overjoyed to explain the relevant changes if Asmodeus is interested in correcting His flaws.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>It is not traditional at Chelish schools to talk much about your classes. After all, your classmates are your competitors, not your friends; sometimes it is mutually beneficial to collaborate on some problems, because two people are smarter than one, but it'd be stupid and pathetic, to try to build friendships out of that.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>These classes are hard not to talk about though. They are compromising by talking about their teacher. This constrains them to things it's fine if he overhears, or to speaking Infernal, which he might think is odd; some of them have bland conversations with innuendo that should be hard for him to catch, and some go for Infernal and wait to see if they'll get slapped for it.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>"And shaping the intuitions requires suffering because it's the - language our subconscious speaks. But teaching how to override it with formal precision doesn't necessarily -"</p>

              <p>He notes, absently, some Chelish girls having conversations in a language he doesn't speak.&nbsp; It doesn't seem particularly worrisome by comparison with people in Chelish Governance wearing intelligence headbands having conversations where Keltham can't see them at all.&nbsp; His research harem is probably just discussing strategies for seducing him or something.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Lately I have been assuming that giving us that advice would be more expensive than, uh, summoning or copying you from your universe. But setting that aside, it seems rather likely that you might need smarter people than we have, or more production surplus, to be able to have them surpass just having experts study an issue and come up with a recommendation to the Queen. And that while we've only got a limited number of smart people you'd want them on something else. Also, the gods have - less information than mortals about most things happening on this plane, but they've specifically got really good information on all the souls that made it to their afterlife, so it's easy for Asmodeus to answer questions on anything that's been around long enough that lots of people in Hell experienced it while living. And alcohol has been around thousands of years. So I'd expect Asmodeus has at least checked whether drinking it more or less makes you more or less Lawful and smarter or stupider and more or less able to adapt in Hell."</p>

A lot of it...based on what you said I would say it's aimed at changing how human instincts and intuitive processes work to be more Lawful, instead of teaching it explicitly. My great-grandfather complains about it but my great-grandfather complains about&nbsp;<em>everything</em>. It is pretty common for people to say that it&nbsp;<em>hurts,&nbsp;</em>at various points - like seeing something very very bright when you've only ever seen dim things, or stretching your legs when you've been sitting on them for a thousand years.

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Abaddon's the one that eats souls. The Abyss is infinite and the one the demons at the Worldwound come from, and reportedly you start out there as a sort of grubbish, larval demon, and if no one kills you first mature into a demon eventually. The Maelstrom is full of energy and magic but nothing reacts in a consistent way to external forces - I guess the laws of logic would still apply there but you couldn't really do any inference - and eventually it turns people into chaos beasts, which aren't possible to interact with and which can't interact with the world, not the physical world or magic or anything else anyone has tried. They are by all accounts happy and think this is cool, but it seems awful to me. Elysium - Chaotic Good - is an infinite wilderness. The kind of people who go there seem to like it? They just wander around exploring. Usually never run into anyone else. Nirvana turns you into an animal, as part of a journey towards Neutral Good, which is very - non-partial? Not caring more about you or people you know than about anything else? And somehow being turned into an animal helps with that. Heaven makes you an angel, like Hell makes you a devil. Devils are perfectly Lawful Evil and angels are perfectly Lawful Good. I guess there's nothing wrong with it but I don't <em>want</em> to be perfectly Lawful Good, you know?"</p>

Once you start demonstrating any inclination towards an alignment you get kicked out of it to there instead.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>He can't come right out and say this next part, it just feels too weird not to put <em>some</em> level of indirection in it where he doesn't come straight out and become the petitioner for sex.</p>
              <p>"Dath ilan has also figured out some alternatives to reproductive sex besides the standard methods of contraception, and even people with contraception have been known to use those alternatives.&nbsp; For much the same reason that wizards here fling themselves off cliffs or have sportfights with - ostriches?&nbsp; I know it wasn't ostriches but I forget which animal you said it was."&nbsp; That gives Carissa an out if she doesn't want to reply directly to the line of conversation about non-reproductive sex.</p>

              <p>Has Keltham decided on Carissa, becomes the question.</p>
              <p>Part of him is scared, but it's the kind of fear where it's a reflex thought that the correct action is probably to overcome it; Keltham has never aspired to be weak.&nbsp; He has no intention of going around never actually having sex for the rest of his life.&nbsp; Having just jumped worlds, there are all kinds of reasons why it'd be wiser to have sex with a relatively older woman first, before getting involved with the younger women in his research harem.&nbsp; Carissa is attractive on a purely physical level, part of him is quite clear on wanting her physically.</p>
              <p>He <em>doesn't</em> know Carissa all that well.&nbsp; But he feels any respect for her, which is probably a good sign?&nbsp; She was at the Worldwound, in the face of danger, and then dropped that to come here right away, in the face of uncertainty.&nbsp; You could make the case for her as a strong, risk-taking woman with goals.&nbsp; But he doesn't quite know what those goals are, or how her career was advanced by being at the Worldwound... they don't really know each other that well.&nbsp; Quick flings can work, or so he's been advised, but only when both sides know that's exactly what it is, as he's also been advised.</p>
              <p>"Oh, it's a challenge on at least some level.&nbsp; What level exactly, that's the question.&nbsp; I suppose, among other things, a potential challenger might wonder what his new world would make of a <em>stronger </em>challenge like that being issued by him and taken up - whether his new world saw any implicit promises as being issued, in either direction.&nbsp; Even implicit promises like somebody having already decided that there's a real chance of something longer-term, because that decision would require more information than I have right now to make one way or another.&nbsp; I don't default on debts, and that means I need to know when I'm taking them on."</p>

People do what they like, and if they like it a lot they might do it again, and if their wants are conditioned on the other person's attitudes then they'd better ask about those." And be good at telling if they're being lied to, but somehow, she expects Keltham would be distracted by the revelation that in Cheliax people lie to get laid. "I do not, in fact, want you particularly conditionally. But the flip side of that is that if <em>you</em> have conditions you're going to have to figure them out."</p>

              <p>Keltham is also trying to figure out what Carissa could have possibly meant by 'hair-pulling'.&nbsp; If he just straightforwardly visualizes somebody pulling on his hair, it could be a moment of spontaneously passionate embrace, but mostly it would just yank his head back, and if it was hard enough to hurt, it would hurt?&nbsp; Though oddly enough, when Keltham tries to visualize the case where Carissa could have meant <em>him </em>pulling <em>her </em>hair - if she hadn't mentioned that in a sexual context, his unrevised first guess would be that it should just make her say ouch.&nbsp; But when he visualizes that producing a sexual response from her instead, that - seems to be booping on some internal sexual part of him that hasn't been booped before?</p>
              <p>Yeah, he's probably going to lose this contest.&nbsp; That's what happens when you challenge somebody older and more experienced.&nbsp; It doesn't mean he's going to lose without dignity.</p>

              <p>He makes a mental note about sending a respectfully brief letter to Lrilatha mentioning his concern about lowering child mortality in a way that might run ahead of agriculture and if that's safe to discuss with Chelish humans y/n, along with a numerical-scale brief question asking whether Keltham should be sending fewer or more letters like that in the future -2/-1/0/1/2.&nbsp; And a mental note to ask about getting one of Irori's books, on the remote chance that it contains a ton of useful exercises for making people less imperfect.&nbsp; He doesn't think a handy guidebook like that should be a thing that already existed here, given that Golarion is still Golarion; but it sounds worth checking, maybe they only got halfway and Keltham can provide the other half.&nbsp; Oh, he should've asked whether Irori counted as Neutral Evil, or what exactly - Keltham still isn't sure he has this alignment thing down at all.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Okay, yeah, that's been puzzling me for a while, the books referred to it too, like there was this one book supposedly by a magic instructor who spends the first chapter telling you about what a great magic instructor he is, where he mentions punishing students at the end of the day so it won't interrupt their learning.&nbsp; If that was literally true and not a weird collection of lies, I'm so confused about this for multiple reasons that I don't even know where to start asking.&nbsp; If I'm like, hey, give me your shoes for twenty silver pieces, and you value your shoes less than that, it makes sense to give me your shoes.&nbsp; If instead I'm like, hey, give me your shoes or I'll put you in an armlock and break your arm, and you actually&nbsp;<em>do</em> that because the value of the shoes is less to you than the value of the unbroken arm, then the fact that you reacted that way is the reason why I made the threat in the first place, right?&nbsp; I mean, assuming I'm the sort of ideal entity who doesn't have any altruism or any inherent desire to behave in a coordinated way with others, if I can go around collecting everyone's shoes by threatening to break their arms, why wouldn't I just go collect all their shoes?&nbsp; So in the," they don't have the word 'counterfactual', lovely, "unreal branch of reality where I threaten to break your arm, you fight and punch me in the face and don't give me your shoes, even though it costs you a broken arm; and since I know that's how it will go, I don't actually threaten to break your arm, and the branch of reality stays unreal."</p>
              <p>"I mean, I can guess that you aren't trained in ways of thinking about real and unreal branches of reality and playing complex strategies over them.&nbsp; But I would have thought it would be more like human instinct, to punch somebody in the face if they threaten to break your arm if you don't give them your shoes.&nbsp; I mean, we get training that's about how we <em>have</em> instincts like that and we need to carefully&nbsp;<em>refine</em> them so they actually lead to optimal real-world outcomes.&nbsp; And then here it sounds like - there is a whole lot <em>more</em> of people punching each other <em>in reality</em> - and then you've got students supposedly <em>paying</em> somebody to punch them in the face and that I just do not get at all."</p>

              <p>"The soul learns through incentives," Asmodia says after a while. "Incentives like 'if I do this thing, it works out nicely for me and I get a glow of satisfaction', but also incentives like 'if I fuck this up, it'll hurt'. The way to teach children not to touch a hot stove is to let them once, and then they'll know. Because the soul is wired to understand feedback from pain faster than it understands feedback from anything else. ...I am aware you may not have souls in dath ilan and I don't know if this still applies without them."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"All right, I think I might have managed to put my finger on a quiet nagging doubt I had before," Keltham says, totally oblivious to any signs of INNER PANIC this might be producing unless somebody actually shows it to him.</p>
              <p>"There's at least three different Baseline words that translate as 'dignity' in this language.&nbsp; But the one I had in mind is - not getting angry at people for behaving the way they're supposed to, or in ways they have a right to do.&nbsp; Not showing outward anger, not letting yourself react inwardly in a way that could lead you to subconsciously - lower their grades later, or the equivalent of that.&nbsp; It's the quality that you display to others so that they'll know it's&nbsp;<em>safe</em> to turn you down for sex, even though you're acting as a manager, and if you weren't confident you'd shown that much dignity you'd be afraid to invite them for sex.&nbsp; Dignity, in the case of my relation to students as a teacher, means that if I make my own mistake on the whiteboard, and you point it out, I don't even <em>internally</em> blame <em>you </em>for <em>my </em>mistake and give you a bad performance review later.&nbsp; Nobody who lacked that kind of dignity would be tapped to give performance reviews.&nbsp; Very few higher managers would be stupid enough to promote a manager who was visibly bad enough at 'dignity' that employees would be afraid to tell them what they were doing wrong.&nbsp; We go through training to avoid that being true of us even subconsciously where our conscious minds wouldn't notice."</p>
              <p>"If you're&nbsp;<em>not</em> in a state of fixed enthusiasm produced by mind-affecting spells, then it's very odd if I just started up teaching again after not doing that for years, in another dimension, across an unknown huge cultural gap, in a non-native language that's translated in my mind by spell, and <em>didn't make any mistakes.</em>&nbsp; I was wordlessly <em>expecting</em> somebody in the class to go 'wrong, that's not how you teach Chelish students,' and that never happened.&nbsp; It might locally pain me some tiny bit to be told that, but it's the kind of hurt that's intrinsic to learning not to do something again, not what I'd classify as - the dath ilani word that translates as 'punishment' in the Lawful sense of that - the kind of hurt where you're deliberately making it worse because you're trying to influence my behavior by imposing costs on me."</p>
              <p>"So, if my concept of dignity is all about thinking and acting in a way that makes there be negligible real social disincentives for you to inform me about my mistakes, even if I didn't ask, and your version of dignity is about always looking cheerful and enthusiastic and not giving me any visible sign that I'm making mistakes, unless I ask, there might've been an inter-cultural problem."</p>

              <p>"A lot of the warnings I got back as a kid - suddenly seem a <em>lot</em> more like they might be necessary and important, if somebody didn't have a lot of actual experience with - what it's like to <em>usefully</em> think weird and unusual thoughts pointing in odd directions.&nbsp; Look, there's a very basic warning, which first gets told in the form of a joke, about a patient who goes to the doctor complaining that his arm starts to hurt if he folds it all the way behind his back, and the doctor says, 'Well, first of all, if it hurts, stop doing it.'&nbsp; If you start feeling like it is a perfectly logical and inevitable conclusion from the Law I've taught that you need to destroy this universe - talk to me, talk to somebody who works fairly directly for Asmodeus, and first of all, <em>stop twisting up like that</em>, just literally pause until you've talked to somebody,&nbsp;because that is not supposed to be an inevitable conclusion from dath ilani premises.&nbsp; Reasoning under structural uncertainty is <em>legit harder</em> and <em>easier to screw up</em> than reasoning when you already know exactly how you're supposed to think, which is boringly easy by comparison.&nbsp; You're going to suck at it for a while.&nbsp; If you arrive at the necessary truth that you must fling yourself into the sea, <em>don't.</em>"</p>

              <p>Keltham is visualizing what Lrilatha's day must be like.&nbsp; She probably walked straight out of this villa and teleported directly to somewhere else where she had to stop somebody from being a massive idiot and plugging all the outputs of the iron factories back into their inputs and then teleported again and then again and does her species even get to <em>sleep</em> and how many of her are there in all of Cheliax,&nbsp;<em>three</em>, she can't fix things on a deep level because the human problems aren't her problems, she doesn't know how to tell people to do it <em>systematically </em><em>better</em> because the current educational system wouldn't hurt <em>her</em> the same way, and Keltham's god isn't talking to him and there's some massive communication barrier that made it easier for Asmodeus to point vaguely in Keltham's direction than to give detailed instructions to anyone and this whole situation is <em>so </em>much more messed-up than he previously realized.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham has managed to rally himself by this point.&nbsp; Fine, so instead of having the metaphorical opportunity to take over a company in a green field with no competition, he has the metaphorical opportunity to take over a company every single part of which is simultaneously wrong, in a green field with no competition.&nbsp; So?&nbsp; He just has to repair enough things, and then they'll work.&nbsp; What's he going to do, give up on that without trying?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is he going to <em>complain,</em> when his immediate prospects include a date with Carissa tonight and he's been assigned a research harem?&nbsp; More no.&nbsp; All of his no.&nbsp; What kind of reply would that be to Chelish Governance providing him with large opportunities?&nbsp; He just has to rise to the challenge, make all the money, fuck all the women, and fix all of the universe's deficiencies.</p>
              <p>All that's changed is that he now has some idea of the actual scope of the problem.&nbsp; Off to the library again he goes!</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(Keltham continues to have no idea of the actual scope of the problem.&nbsp; The horrifying planetwide disaster of universally awful institutional design that Keltham is currently envisioning is somewhere around 1% as dysfunctional as, say, an alternate Prime Material with a roughly equivalent tech level to dath ilan's but the modal social outcome for that.&nbsp; He continues to not be mentally on the same page as Golarion, nor, indeed, the same book, same language, same library, same city, same planet, or same laws of physics as Golarion.)</p>
