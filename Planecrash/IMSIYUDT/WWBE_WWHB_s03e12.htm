If Maillol (he has to be in trouble, that's the only reason they'd know how long he'll be indisposed) didn't know in advance who'd be able to do this then there isn't a wizard that powerful who's up to date on the whole thing.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>If the word 'rape' is translating at all correctly, Keltham is having some trouble seeing how the notion of a 'rape fetish' isn't as obviously paradoxical as 'asking somebody to rape you'; but presumably there's some elided meta/object distinction that makes sense of it, and in any case that's not the most urgent topic right now.</p>
              <p>So.&nbsp; Pilar has the fetish.&nbsp; But it's very common locally, maybe it's 1/3 of the population, say, if he'd also checked Ione then taking the universe at face value there'd be a 55% probability of at least one of the two having the fetish.&nbsp; But still, it should probably be called something like one bit of evidence favoring the eroLARP hypothesis.</p>
              <p>"I wasn't saying Sevar was too stupid for it," Keltham replies after taking a moment to think.&nbsp; "I was saying the concept structure came at the end of a long series of other concepts, that would take too long to explain.&nbsp; Higher Intelligence doesn't let you bypass that sequence, what would be needed is that you have a lot of prerequisites that I'd guess to be outright unknown in Golarion."</p>
              <p>There's also the concern about whether explaining the notion of an eroLARP to people inside the eroLARP will drive them insane or cause this universe to collapse.&nbsp; But if Carissa is able to hear him talking about his weird theories and the very smart people immediately investigate them in Pilar and report back to him, it doesn't seem like that kind of eroLARP; they're apparently allowed to know.&nbsp; Anyways, though it seems kind of foolish in retrospect, he already published that private key.</p>

              <p>"I'm not really sure how to say it, except that the patterns are in my memories out of dath ilan, and their origin in dath ilan was complicated," Keltham replies.&nbsp; "I would not have particularly <em>expected</em> to find facts and events here, corresponding to those memories.&nbsp; And a lot of things don't correspond in that way, to be clear, I'd have been much less confused, getting here, if this world was even 5% made out of things I was expecting to see.&nbsp; But there's bits and pieces of this world, all over, that fit into one pattern or another.&nbsp; And the danger is that I'm just looking up at random clouds, and seeing faces, trees, patterns in the sky that are pure coincidence.&nbsp; As you say, if the fetish is very common here, then Pilar having it isn't much evidence."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>All right, that's slightly impressive, maybe the bigger headbands are actually good for anything.</p>
              <p>"It would have to be, yeah, but I don't exactly have a lot of specifics and what specifics I have... aren't something I'm thinking of a good metaphor for... let me think."&nbsp; Sure, if you've got <em>enough</em> prerequisites, it's obvious in retrospect that the explanation for what happened to Keltham is that <em>almost </em>all of the copies of him ended, across the multiverse of everything being infinitely embedded all over the multiverse, and this is one of the Kelthams that didn't end, in some universe that's either higher-complexity than his original universe or of course a higher-complexity specific embedded somewhere simpler than that, and then, arguendo, if the EroLARP Hypothesis is correct, he was localized to somewhere such that it has convenient evolutionarily-implausible 'masochists' who are <em>super </em>okay with not being let out of their chains when they struggle, so that hurting them during sex, which it turned out you really wanted to do, doesn't get you kicked out of that city or exiled to the Last Resort.</p>
              <p>Keltham <em>has not figured out why this would be the case,&nbsp;</em>but he doesn't need a specific hypothesis of&nbsp;<em>why</em> to notice what it&nbsp;<em>looks like</em> and start generating predictions.</p>
              <p>And then, of course, you have the problem of explaining this to a Golarion native who has no idea that her own world sure looks like it runs on quantum mechanics the same as dath ilan, and how that means there's an exponentially vast number of near-exact copies of her spread all over the <em>local</em> amplitudes to say nothing of the alternate laws of physics that embed each other as substructures.</p>
              <p>Does Taldane contain the word 'fanfiction'?&nbsp; No it does not.&nbsp; Well, there goes that metaphor for 'this world is a continuation fic of my life because in an infinite multiverse containing an infinite number of fanfiction writers no book can ever truly end', which, on reflection, would probably have been an overly disturbing thing to try to explain <em>anyways.</em></p>

              <p>"So Carissa Sevar is, in fact, under your de facto power, exactly where she wants to be and needs to be.&nbsp; The possible problems I foresee, stem from you failing to understand that this is what she needs, this is what she wants, this is how her sexuality works, and that your de facto power to do anything you want with Sevar is <em>part</em> though of course not&nbsp;<em>all</em> of why she started being attracted to you in the first place.&nbsp; It is in the interest of Cheliax for obvious reasons that you continue to be happy with Carissa, fond of her home country of Cheliax, energized and productive for your project, and not <em>distracted </em>by being <em>heartbroken </em>after what happened when you were always careful to emphasize to Carissa how much she was free to go at any time if she didn't want to stay."</p>

              <p>...and now the tree isn't branching further.&nbsp; Keltham is having more trouble than usual thinking about this.&nbsp; Part of himself is recoiling in horror and it's not because the situation being described sounds awful for Carissa, it's because something about it seems terrible and threatening for&nbsp;<em>him.</em></p>
              <p>Is it that he distrusts himself with power?</p>
              <p>Is it that he's afraid of pressuring himself into doing something to Carissa that he didn't really want to do, even&nbsp;<em>if</em> she turns out to want it?</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"I think, first and foremost, that you should not press yourself too hard or make yourself unhappy by going too far too early, even if that's what Sevar wants," Isidre says, making a sudden change of plans.&nbsp; "This is an Evil country, not a Good one, and among the foundational reasons for that is that Good people all trying to help each other instead of themselves seem to inevitably end up sad and unhappy at the end of it.&nbsp; You have a Civilization to build here, Keltham, your role in life is not actually to make Sevar happy.&nbsp; She is responsible for her own life's happiness, as you are for yours."</p>
              <p>"<em>With that said,</em> if you yourself,&nbsp;<em>for your own sake and not hers,</em> decided one day to demand that the government of Cheliax give you absolute-power over her and order our Security to put her forcibly into her chains any time she didn't want to go, Carissa Sevar herself would be very, very happy about that.&nbsp; But I will quite understand if you do not wish to essay that until you are confident of your ability to discern that happiness for yourself."</p>
              <p>"And.&nbsp; There are other women in Cheliax if Sevar's happiest outcome is <em>not what you want.</em>&nbsp; You are not obliged to give literally the first girl in this world that you talked to everything that she wants from life, at your own expense.&nbsp; That is what it means to be Evil rather than Good."</p>
              <p>"A further warning.&nbsp; Sevar is not the most extreme case of what she is.&nbsp; Pilar Pineda is more submissive than Sevar, substantially more masochistic than Sevar, and would, in a way very strange to you, feel raped if you made her have a careful conversation about sex instead of just forcibly throwing her onto a bed.&nbsp; My considered opinion is that if you are struggling and flailing with Sevar you are <em>absolutely certainly</em> not ready for Pineda."</p>

              <p>Are his instincts trying to tell him something?&nbsp; Keltham now wishes he hadn't eaten that snack; but he's at least not going to eat any more.<br><br></p>
              <p>His brain, still running in the background and creative as ever, suggests that, if this is an eroLARP-ish context and therefore Keltham has a dreadful buried urge to rape somebody which Pilar matches, he could in fact run three Augury spells before trying that, to check what the consequences would be.&nbsp; Obviously after having first done a bunch more work to verify that the Augury uses his own utility function or a sufficiently aligned neighboring one.</p>
              <p>Keltham tells that thread to shut up.&nbsp; He's starting to doubt this whole eroLARP business if it implies that he would enjoy <em>that</em>.&nbsp; Anyways the concept of a 'rape fetish' in the sense of 'wanting unwanted sex' is literally paradoxical and the term presumably means something else.</p>

              <p>"In practice, the actual and much simpler reply is that the revelation from Asmodeus which led to this project's establishment said, or at least, we think this is what Asmodeus was trying to say, to not pull any of that on you.&nbsp; So no such discussion was ever entertained at any level of government.&nbsp; If you're looking for a simple answer that doesn't require you to worry about backroom discussions by people like me, it's right there, I suppose.&nbsp; Possibly that's why Asmodeus ordained it so, if you feel that way.&nbsp; I don't think we <em>would </em>have decided to unsheathe blades at you, absent His order, but I can see His order simplifying things from your perspective."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>That couldn't&nbsp;<em>actually</em> be the reason for Asmodeus's instructions, could it?&nbsp; No, it has to be some pre-existing godagreement, or a bargain with Abadar and Nethys whose initial premise was that they cooperated to bring Keltham here and Cheliax got first crack at him, or one of the other likely possibilities that Aspexia reluctantly discussed (reluctantly because Aspexia would rather that Abrogail shut up and follow His orders).&nbsp; Absent those instructions, Cheliax most certainly could have gotten compliance out of Keltham, regardless of his society's silly pretense of a godlike immunity to threats -</p>
              <p>And now Keltham is thinking about how the other possibility would've played out, whether he could commit suicide using a Create Water cantrip or other tools that his god could unilaterally give him.&nbsp; But Cheliax could just raise you, then, poor fool; Miracle doesn't require consent.&nbsp; The only danger would be if Abadar could instruct Osirion to raise Keltham before Cheliax could, and Cheliax would know it was in a race and they would have that information first -</p>
              <p><em>Now</em> Keltham is also thinking about Raise Dead, and thinking about the story Carissa gave him about oaths, and how he could if necessary break an oath over something trivial, unilaterally in a way that nobody else depended on so it wouldn't actually violate the ~~~~~~~~~~, and so go to Abaddon.</p>
              <p>Keltham expects to - just end up somewhere else, if he did that?&nbsp; But he knows he might not and this doesn't faze him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>He'd literally rather go to Abaddon than comply.</em>&nbsp; True death doesn't scare him as much as it scares some dath ilani, he's thinking now, and - he's not even imagining Cheliax severely torturing him in a scary way to which he'd prefer nonexistence, the thought that they could break him with torture still hasn't <em>occurred </em>to him, he'd just <em>walk out on this entire universe and existence itself rather than accept a forced unfair division of gains from trade,</em> because if you can't do that, why would anybody bother bargaining fairly with you.</p>
              <p>He wouldn't actually have been able to do it, if Cheliax was running Detect Thoughts on him, and not otherwise restrained by Asmodeus.&nbsp; They've ever had experience with uncooperative torture victims.&nbsp; You don't instantly end up in Abaddon and instantly get eaten.</p>
              <p>...but maybe, just maybe, Abrogail feels the tiniest shred of respect for Keltham at this point.&nbsp; That degree of 'fuck you' is something she can appreciate.</p>
              <p>Of course now she wants even more to see what Keltham's mind would look like when it broke, but Asmodeus said not to do that so she won't.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>See, Keltham's lips are moving again and Carissa's getting confused about the nature of Good and Evil again, it's getting to be a pattern. Lastwall wouldn't hand her over, probably - why? 'simplifies cooperation with people like Keltham' jumps to mind as an explanation with Fox's Cunning up, in a way it wouldn't jump to mind otherwise. But obviously the Good gods do sacrifice people to horrible fates to achieve their goals ....what's the difference? Is it just that Good gets incredibly worked up about rape in particular?</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Why did Asmodeus tell them to cooperate with Keltham? It's one of three important glaring confusions right now, along with "what is Maillol in trouble for" because Carissa suspects she's probably in trouble for the same thing, even if they're going to punish them one at a time about it, and "what does Cayden Cailean want" which she's trying not to think about but which feels salient since they're talking about, you know, Good and whether they sacrifice people to be raped if it achieves their long goals...</p>

              <p>"In almost any place and&nbsp;<em>organization</em> in Golarion, you will find a large number of people running around believing things that are not true, that bear at best a tenuous connection to reality, or no connection at all, stories that got repeatedly passed around and distorted.&nbsp; I would guess that dath ilan prevents this, somehow, I can't actually imagine how, which means it might never occur to you that something people were whispering excitedly to each other might <em>not</em> be true."</p>

Presumably not literally just here to fuck with Carissa, that'd be taking pride a little far, but certainly going to fuck with Carissa while she's here. As she is entitled to. Because she can do whatever she wants.</p>
              <p>(Carissa isn't exactly surprised by, but does admire, the perfectly straight face 'Isidre' has been keeping for the last twenty seconds.)</p>

              <p>Why yes, dear, while all our eighth-circle wizards are currently on the front lines with Nidal, there <em>is</em> an eighth-circle sorcerer remaining with incredibly high Splendour who would enjoy having a chat about Carissa Sevar's sexuality and, oh, yes, that other topic you requested be introduced.</p>
              <p>So nice of you to write such a perfectly targeted request, less than 12 hours after my personal order of Irori monks had arduously, <em>painstakingly </em>badgered me into agreeing to not bother you again unless and until <em>my strictly conventional duties to Cheliax</em> called for that.</p>

              <p>The second thought is to ask whether this rumor is perhaps true.</p>
              <p>It admittedly&nbsp;<em>does in fact</em> sound a lot more like the sort of thing that would be passed around six-year-old kids, than would make very much sense in real life, but&nbsp;<em>even in Golarion,</em> presumably, the people who pass around rumors like that are probably running their own sanity checks&nbsp;<em>at all,</em> and think it's not completely obviously false?</p>
              <p>"Does the rumor say it's consensual or a pharaoh-of-Osirion situation?" Keltham inquires.&nbsp; He is putting any flashes of anger on hold pending evaluation of probabilities.</p>

And maybe, if that is restricting Her Imperial Majestrix from things she'd otherwise like to do, they can ensure Carissa remains shaped appropriately for Asmodeus's goals with memory-erasing magic so Carissa has no idea what the Queen is doing with her?</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>...Carissa's model of Aspexia Rugatonn is&nbsp;<em>still not happy about that plan&nbsp;</em>and oh, yep, that'd be why Maillol's in trouble, he waded into a Church-Crown conflict.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa was braced for the Queen to say a bunch of flattering nonsense that has nothing to do with the real reason which is that Asmodeus chose her. Or, well, maybe Asmodeus choosing her was related to her understanding the Law better than almost anyone, but, realistically, it was probably a combination of that plus being attractive to Keltham plus being a heretic in a coincidentally useful direction -</p>
              <p>- anyway. Obviously the Queen of Cheliax doesn't like Carissa for the traits that Carissa values most in herself. It would be pathetic to believe that. It would be pathetic to believe even if it's being spoken into your ears with very high Splendour by someone who would know. Carissa is not pathe- okay, Carissa<em> is</em> pathetic, Carissa has spent like five percent of her mental motions this conversation on being happy that Keltham is protective of her, you can't do that and then claim you're not pathetic, but Carissa's not <em>that&nbsp;</em>pathetic. The Queen wants Carissa because she can't have her, and Carissa's personality has very little to do with it, because one doesn't show that much personality while being horribly tortured anyway and the thing the Queen wants to do with Carissa is horribly torture her. This is the not pathetic thing to believe and Carissa believes it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>But it's true that she had the highest spellcraft at her Worldwound installation. And it's kind of nice that Cheliax did have that written down somewhere. (Unless they didn't, and learned it from her irritably thinking it earlier today, which now that she thinks about it seems likelier.)</p>
              <p>And it's true that she understands something no one else did, which made Asmodeus choose her.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>....and it's true that he'd have done that even if there were only a tiny chance she did anything useful, and that if she fails he won't care if the Queen turns her into a statue and she never ever ever exists again. Stop being pathetic you will be&nbsp;<em>gone&nbsp;</em>you won't&nbsp;<em>exist&nbsp;</em>the stakes are&nbsp;<em>much&nbsp;</em>too high to be that&nbsp;<em>contemptible&nbsp;</em></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa exists because she might serve Asmodeus and might serve Cheliax, and she intends to try to do that, and she does not have any feelings at all.</p>

              <p>"Keltham, you're missing a lot of context here on how submission works, but - among the approaches that had occurred to me, if things developed in that direction of greater complication - was seeing if the Queen could rent Sevar from you for a half-day for five hundred gold pieces and get it out of her system.&nbsp; Please don't object that you don't own Sevar, the point is that this is a recognized practice when somebody like Sevar gives herself to you, and the fact that the Queen would be <em>renting </em>Sevar from you means that she isn't <em>stealing</em> Sevar from you or <em>fighting</em> with you over Sevar and the whole thing is occurring in a way that acknowledges Sevar is yours and not the Queen's and the Queen only gets to have her because you said so -"</p>

              <p>"In dath ilan, we have systems of revocable delegation that people can use to aggregate into much larger political factions in a way that remains legible at every level of organization.&nbsp; Among its other uses, this permits Civilization to annually form a Masculine Faction and Feminine Faction to negotiate with each other about what common masculine and feminine behaviors should be, not one standard for everyone, but pieces you can make your own behavior out of and have them be quickly describable to others and mesh well with other standard behaviors.&nbsp; Like, grandmothers are one subkind of women and grandfathers are one subkind of men, that sort of thing.&nbsp; This requires real Lawfulness and therefore shouldn't be able to exist in Golarion, and therefore all of your notions of what grandmothers and grandfathers should be like, must come from somewhere else -"</p>
              <p>"I'm probably digressing here, my point is, you're describing something weird enough that I'm trying to fall back to basics and make sure of my foundations.&nbsp; You are describing a system in which somebody, usually a man, does something with a second person, usually a woman, that falls into a standard pattern that they both understand, and which some third party therefore also understands."</p>
              <p>"That system of meshing behavior patterns is that the party of the second part -" Taldane please, you can't use that many syllables for <em>that,</em> your contracts would be infinity pages long.</p>
              <p>"That meshing-pattern system is that Two tells One that One can do whatever One wants with Two.&nbsp; After which One rents out some of Two's time to Three, but it's not that Two is anything like a rentable resource that One rents into a market for Twos, it's that One and Two and Three all think that's hot.&nbsp; And maybe also Two likes to trade oral sex for footrubs and Three likes to give footrubs and One does not like to give footrubs, and usually you'd just solve this problem by Two and Three forming a secondary or tertiary relationship," like normal sane people do when monogamy isn't working for someone, "but if Two gave themselves fully to One, then One is supposed to decide who Two fucks, so One being able to demand money for that from Three, is a symbol of how One still has all the Two and hasn't given any of it back to Two to use, or Three paying One is symbolic of how much Three isn't taking away some of what Two gave One, Three is paying One for it.&nbsp; Is that about right?"</p>

              <p>It could almost be a dath ilani poem from some layer of some virtue, though he does not know which virtue it would correspond to.&nbsp; There is a spirit in it that is not in any poem he can remember having heard before, something that comes to it from the way that it is a relation between a mortal and something larger than that, being trusted.</p>
              <p>He closes his eyes and imagines it, he doesn't bother with imagining a better world drawn in grains of sand, the better world his god draws is drawn in grains of people, agents all over the world interacting with each other.&nbsp; Their actions scattered and uncoordinated, for now, stepping on each other and hurting each other, for now, but there are other actions they could take instead that would make all of them better off, fairly.</p>
              <p>He imagines himself as one of those grains, one of those people, and if this was going to be a realistic metaphor he should be a special one, maybe, except that right now he's not.&nbsp; Just one of all the people in Golarion hoping for this war to end quickly, and contributing the tiny little action that is cheering their god on; if they all do that, they'll all be better off.&nbsp; Keltham visualizes a grain like any other, to represent himself.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa closes her eyes and prays for Asmodeus to win.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It's a sincere prayer, obviously. She does not like Zon-Kuthon and she believes in the project Zon-Kuthon was willing to blow up everything in order to oppose.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She's definitely some flavor of heretic at this point. She isn't sure what flavor. She assumes they're mostly monitoring for whether she's about to betray the project, and she's not, she believes in the project with as much conviction as she can recall ever having felt for anything that isn't the continued survival of Carissa Sevar. Which is also served by the project succeeding. But there was a set of stories meant to point people like her in the right direction, and she knew they were lies, and now she had to face what specifically they were lies about, and learn a new set, which are also lies, but lies better suited to the position she finds herself in now, and -</p>
              <p>- she knows she can't handle the truth. She knows that even in dath ilan there's the concept not everyone can handle every truth, she knows it's possible to learn the Law even when many truths are hidden from you. But she's slightly worried that until she invents evil dath ilan thinking herself everything'll ring a bit wrong, not quite crafted for a mortal mind in the particular fragile place Carissa finds herself in.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Except, maybe, advice for little children about prayer. Slightly adjusted advice, no one ever told Carissa Asmodeus was trying to craft a better world. That's still true. It's true to Keltham, too, it landed, meant something, and she can worry later about what that means for the plan where they seduce him into Evil, it seems just as important to their plans that they find the bits of their own teaching that feel true even to dath ilan.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She imagines herself a grain of sand in the grand designs of Asmodeus, and strives to be placed where she'd needed, and fierce in remaining there, no matter what interference of other gods or other grains of sand, and hopes that Asmodeus can see, from where he stands, something beautiful and right and strong and Lawful that can be built of mortal building blocks.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Zon-Kuthon is losing too quickly.</p>
              <p>Zon-Kuthon is a god; and depending on how you count it, either a very old entity, or something built out of the corpse of something that old.&nbsp; He models reality, therefore, entirely in probability distributions.&nbsp; He has no mortal heritage of any other way of seeing.</p>
              <p>When this war began Zon-Kuthon formed a probability distribution over how long the fight should take, and gambled on a chance to drag it out long enough to ruin the crops and visit misery on a generation.&nbsp; But He is losing too fast, in the unreasonably far tails of that probability distribution, especially given the further information He now has about the war's participants.</p>
              <p>The external-demigod-assembling fragments that Zon-Kuthon deliberately set to reunite with Himself quickly and early in predictable locations, to act as tests of the theory that all His longer-buried fragments are being hunted and destroyed somehow, returned to Him.&nbsp; And yet Zon-Kuthon... does not have an ominous intuition, He was never that mortal.&nbsp; He has rather the hypothesis that Nethys is opposing Him, that this is the reason for His losing too quickly, and the implication that, if so, His longer-buried external-demigod-assembling fragments will be gone.</p>
              <p>He randomizes, then, with far too much power, in a way that Nethys can of course see but should not be able to <em>foresee </em>with prophecy shattered; and based on the result makes an expensive calculation of where something will be while its trajectory is still complicated; He focuses much of Himself someplace it is not at all convenient for Him to be, losing ground in the war as He does; and there He finds that His external-demigod-assembling fragment that should have been flitting through that location is gone.</p>
              <p>He knows, then, He understands the betrayal and that Nethys it was who worked it all upon Him from the beginning.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>And what does Zon-Kuthon do, when He is betrayed?</p>
              <p>Mostly, of course, Zon-Kuthon does what serves Zon-Kuthon's longest purposes of pain, misery, terror, mutilation, woe.</p>
              <p>But if there were a tiebreaker between two strategies - if there is some little thing that Zon-Kuthon can do along the way -&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Then Dou-Bral, if He had been so betrayed, would have done some last thing He could to work vengeance on His betrayer.</p>
              <p>And all that Dou-Bral was, Zon-Kuthon is not.</p>
              <p>Nethys is betraying Him?&nbsp; Of course He is.&nbsp; How amusing.&nbsp; No doubt Zon-Kuthon will be the first of many.&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon then will tell nothing to the other gods of how Nethys has begun the series of downfalls that will inevitably lead to Their own destruction, destruction more complete than Zon-Kuthon's mere sealing.&nbsp; Whoever currently thinks they are Nethys's ally will find themselves mistaken; Zon-Kuthon can guess, of course, that Nethys is probably trying to side with fellow gods who also once were mortal, but Nethys being Nethys, the road that has been started down is one from which Nethys is unlikely to be able to turn back.</p>
              <p>It is not a certainty, obviously, this beautiful vision.&nbsp; But the probability is one to gamble on; and a better gamble than the one where Zon-Kuthon announces Nethys's sins, in which case there is not much chance&nbsp;at all&nbsp;of lasting damage to the world and misery to the gods.</p>
              <p>He will go into the vault, then, for a time, and say nothing of Nethys's betrayal.&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon has been exiled once before, after all, and it did not last.&nbsp; Evil stays contained less long than one might hope.&nbsp; If Nethys brings enough ruin to the gods, the vault will last even less.<br><br></p>
              <p>Zon-Kuthon's pieces begin to gather into the vault. &nbsp;They will not slay Him; they need Him to counterbalance Asmodeus yet.</p>

              <p><em>Zon-Kuthon, a known existential threat, attacked the exact location where my mortal followers had secured and contained the anomaly.</em></p>
              <p><em>My anomaly-storing followers validly deduced that this meant that Zon-Kuthon knew about the anomaly, knew where the anomaly was being stored, and was targeting the anomaly.</em></p>
              <p><em>They knew that if Zon-Kuthon had attacked the anomaly at this location before, Zon-Kuthon might attack the same location again, more forcefully, and perhaps breach containment.</em></p>
              <p><em>They therefore moved the anomaly to an even more protected location which Zon-Kuthon might not know to target, though they are protecting it without trying to make that assumption.</em></p>
              <p><em>Since You had only recently declared the containment zone and I was busy containing known existential threat Zon-Kuthon, my followers did not know, while making this decision, that they were leaving Your containment zone in their choice of new location.</em></p>
              <p><em>I realize that this is not the outcome You desired, Otolmens.&nbsp; But I, Asmodeus, have not acted with intent to contravene the spirit, let alone the letter, of your Pharasma's-Name Edict, and the subsequent events will clearly be legible to Pharasma or any other sufficiently informed gods as being how I described them.</em></p>
              <p>Asmodeus goes legible so that Otolmens can see that He is being completely sincere.&nbsp; Look how legible Asmodeus is.</p>

              <p>There is now nothing preventing Asmodeus from giving instructions to Asmodeus-obeying mortals, such as, for example, instructions to move the anomaly back to the containment zone.&nbsp; Where Zon-Kuthon will not be able to attack it again, since Zon-Kuthon is now sealed.</p>

              <p>Now, however, in addition to having already used up many resources on the previous interdiction field, Asmodeus's followers are at war with Zon-Kuthon's followers to help prevent further existential threat from any previous plans Zon-Kuthon has laid.&nbsp; This will be grindingly expensive to Asmodeus's followers.</p>
              <p>They cannot afford to lay a new interdiction field while the war is still continuing, so they stored the anomaly inside a previously built interdiction field with existing heavy security.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>(Manipulating Otolmens to a particular conclusion that She is allowed to reach is easier than with other gods, because Otolmens does not try to be less predictable; it is unfortunate that most of the conclusions one might desire from Her are ones She will not reach by any pathway.<br><br></p>
              <p>There is, very clearly, a plot afoot, one that has just resulted in a god's downfall.&nbsp; Asmodeus wants to know what that plot is, whether Asmodeus's interests are a primary target of it, who exactly is behind it.</p>
              <p>He needs information.</p>
              <p>He has a list of suspects.</p>
              <p>Who is known to already know about, and have acted around, the anomaly?&nbsp; Abadar, Nethys, Otolmens, Irori, Cayden Cailean.</p>
              <p>Otolmens need not be considered.</p>
              <p>In the case that Asmodeus's interests are being targeted by the plot, Abadar would not have originally reached out to Asmodeus with a poisoned trade; Abadar retaliates, in such matters, but does not attack.&nbsp; Also the whole thing is not really Abadar's style.</p>
              <p>The remaining gods involved, Cayden Cailean, Nethys, and Irori, are all former mortals.&nbsp; Formerly mortal gods do tend to be more interventionist in mortal matters, and so more likely to appear there, but still.&nbsp; The thought has not escaped Asmodeus that perhaps there is some common interest of the gods who were once human, opposed to the interests of the gods who never were.</p>
              <p>Who else was clearly involved?</p>
              <p>Gorum, Chaotic Neutral god of battle, who suddenly switched sides about whether Zon-Kuthon should be allowed to roam free.&nbsp; Gorum being Gorum, He might not demand to know all about it, it is not in the nature of War that all soldiers must understand why they fight; but whoever contacted Him and successfully brought Him on board was probably somebody whose purpose Gorum finds sympathetic.</p>
              <p>Iomedae is formerly human, and her work often conduces to Gorum's ends.&nbsp; And Iomedae now holds the key to a certain vault.&nbsp; But Iomedae will only use that key under certain rigidly defined conditions; holding it does not clearly benefit Her by much.</p>
              <p>And if you consider this entire plot, it does look, a bit, more in the style of Chaos than of Law, or at most Neutral on that axis.&nbsp; To be a god is not to have the nature of carrying out strategies that some third party might see as nothing but otherwise-featureless choices of paths to final consequences; if that were so, there would be little overt difference between Lawful and Chaotic ones.&nbsp; Gods drink more deeply than that, of their own natures, and Lawful gods make Lawful plans and Chaotic gods make Chaotic ones.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus will see, then, what Milani, formerly-mortal Chaotic Good goddess of revolution, will do, given a prompt to meddle in this particular issue, and perhaps that will prove revealing.)</p>

              <p>Well, Asmodeus is being, in fact, pretty straightforward for once, more straightforward than He'd be with anyone who wasn't Otolmens.</p>
              <p>Otolmens asked for Asmodeus to tell His followers to do something very expensive in the middle of their war with Nidal.&nbsp; It would cost them somewhere in the vicinity of 100,000 gold pieces, more than 50,000gp, less than 200,000gp.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus does not think that this matter is going to destroy the world and is not going to do this out of the charity of His heart.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus wants to be paid.&nbsp; He's not going to mess with Otolmens, because Otolmens, but He wants to be paid.</p>
              <p>That's it.&nbsp; Look at how legible Asmodeus is being about how He didn't set Otolmens up for this, didn't secretly prompt Her into making the request, and isn't trying to sneakily make His mortals do anything more expensive.</p>
              <p>If Milani could suggest a straightforward trade and service for Otolmens to do, that Asmodeus will accept, without being particularly Chaotic or Good about it which Asmodeus will NOT accept, then Milani would be doing Her proper part to help out Otolmens, just as Asmodeus is not trying to pull anything complicated on Her.</p>
              <p>As for specifics beyond that, Asmodeus will not discuss Otolmens's affairs without Her consent, lest even more gods meddle in them.</p>

              <p><em>The service I have in mind will benefit Cheliax, currently Yours for now.&nbsp; </em><em>Cheliax by and large tends to do things that I find very unpleasant.&nbsp; But as the symmetry and opposition between your interests and mine is not perfect, there is a chance here for mutual benefit.&nbsp; Nidal, for example, manages to be such an awful place that Cheliax is actually better than it, and for Cheliax to conquer Nidal entirely would serve both of Us well - though the gain from Your perspective would be larger than the gain from Mine, and I would demand payment to make up that difference.</em></p>
              <p><em>I propose in particular that you legibly exhibit to Me your honest expectation of how long the war with Nidal will otherwise last and how much it will otherwise cost; our compact will call for You to pay Me for how much better for Cheliax the war ends up going, compared to that expectation, after I suggest my proposed service to Otolmens.&nbsp; You will pay me for improvements as they become nearly certain, however, rather than waiting for the war to end.&nbsp; I would commit not to using those payments to work against Your interests; not everything that I want is something you hate.</em></p>
              <p><em>One similarly observes that although You derive similar pleasure from torturing most of the souls in your possession, there are in truth some souls' tortures that I find more tragic than others, even though they are all tragic.&nbsp; If Cheliax ends up with a counterfactually larger population compared to what You expected, after Otolmens's intervention suggested by me - due to their increased counterfactual wealth and hence population growth, or their conquest of other territories - the compact would call for You to instruct Cheliax to use fewer of certain tactics and techniques that you designed specifically to lead good people into damnation.&nbsp; If the payment cannot be made up that way, it can be made up in relaxations of other Chelish policies designed at producing damnations of people who are not, in fact, particularly evil.&nbsp; I would also accept payment in the form of stays of torment for souls of my choice in Hell.</em></p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodeus has many thoughts about this; even this fraction of His mind is large and has room for many thoughts inside it.&nbsp; Among those thoughts is that this compact would happen to benefit Milani a great deal more if, for some reason, Asmodeus had otherwise underestimated how well the war with Nidal would go for Cheliax; and Milani, somehow, knew about this, when Asmodeus did not.</p>
              <p>It is still relatively good news about whether Milani - and some conspiracy that She is part of - is mainly plotting something directly and irrevocably opposed to Asmodeus's interests; unless, of course, that is exactly what Milani wants Asmodeus to think.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus responds with a counter-proposal.&nbsp; It has much more stringent definitions of exactly what kind of counterfactual improvements will be said to be traceable to Milani's particular suggestion for Otolmens's intervention.&nbsp; He is not willing to include all the knock-on effects, just in case Milani has something up Her sleeve in one of them.</p>
              <p>(The overcomplicated terms are designed to exclude, in passing, improvements in war conditions and of Cheliax's health that go through Otolmens's service but <em>also</em> passed through whatever has His squirrels in the anomaly's immediate vicinity so excited.&nbsp; Asmodeus <em>has</em> noticed them becoming more excited, over the last couple of days.</p>
              <p>If Milani rejects that part - or suggests overcomplicated modifications in return that would again count knock-on benefits passing through whatever-excited-His-squirrels - Asmodeus will have a much clearer idea of what is going on.)</p>
              <p>The part about stays of torment for souls in Hell is, of course, entirely unacceptable.&nbsp; The crushing inevitability and hopelessness is really part of the whole point there.&nbsp; Though Asmodeus supposes that Milani could suggest some very, very high rate of conversion between new souls added and old souls stayed, with temporary stays of torment doomed to end.</p>
              <p>(If Milani suggests an astronomical but reachable rate, it will suggest that, for some reason, Her target is a particular soul in Hell, and the rest of this is just an elaborate ruse to disguise it.&nbsp; Asmodeus doesn't know&nbsp;<em>why</em> Milani would do that, it seems more Stupid Good than Chaotic Good, but it's among the many many possibilities that Asmodeus is considering for what might really be going on.)</p>
              <p>Also Asmodeus is not going to integrate the expected benefits over infinite time to be paid out immediately because Asmodeus is not three minutes old.</p>

              <p>It involves exactly the sort of overcomplicated amendments to Asmodeus's amendments that you might expect from somebody who had no idea what the original amendments had really been about, but didn't want to admit that.&nbsp; The new set of overcomplications do still happen to exclude any knock-on effects of Otolmens's service that pass through Keltham's project.</p>
              <p>Milani suggests a conversion rate of 36 counterfactual souls expected to be added over the next 100 years, per 1 soul's torment stayed now for up to 100 years; but the stays will pass through Erecura, the Lawful Neutral goddess who now resides within Dis as Dispater's consort, and Asmodeus Himself will not know who is targeted by them, nor may He attempt to find out, nor may those stayed be told by Hell how they came to be so blessed.</p>

              <p>Nidal's current stocks, combat stores, private stashes, combat reserve stores, emergency reserves, emergency private stashes, final emergency reserves, and all other diamonds in Nidal, don't actually end up massing all that much; a 25,000gp diamond is not a large object by the standards of anything except diamonds.</p>
              <p>Broom is nonetheless mildly startled by how many diamonds just fell onto the table in front of him while he was eating lunch.&nbsp; He wasn't really expecting any diamonds at all, let alone that many.</p>
