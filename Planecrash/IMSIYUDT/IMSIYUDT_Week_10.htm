            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa ducks out from the crowd headed to dinner and goes to her room.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She's pretty sure she can fake her way through a date with Keltham, but she doesn't want to? She can come up with several justifications and she's not sure she buys any of them but one is that - when they tell him more, which they're going to have to, eventually, she'd like to tell him that she wasn't lying about this. Another one is that - she is trying to become bigger, more capable, more Evil, in the sense of&nbsp;<em>wanting Evil things for her own reasons&nbsp;</em>rather than the sense of being willing to do what it takes to survive, and so it seems like practice in the wrong direction, to go on a date while not wanting to. Another one is that at lunchtime she was so happy, full of ideas and satisfaction and cleverness and the conviction that there was something big and beautiful and perfect out there and Keltham was leading her towards it, and she wants&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>back.</p>
              <p>She doesn't, objectively speaking, have any reason to have lost it. She has basically earned confirmation that she was right, that there is something big and beautiful and perfect out there and that Keltham is leading her towards it, her and not anybody else, or at least her first. She didn't have the details nailed down but if you'd asked her to bet at lunchtime she wouldn't have bet she had the details right already. The main reason she now feels sick and small and scared isn't that she was wrong at lunchtime, it's that she realized since then that the path to big and beautiful and perfect requires skills she doesn't have and doesn't have long to acquire -&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- not a useful line of thought -</p>
              <p>- why does she want to go on a date with Keltham? Other than because there's a competition with that as a win condition and she's very competitive. Other than because if they have children they'll be very smart and Cheliax will objectively owe her lots of money for them whether or not it pays up. Other than because he's attractive, when he's trying to be that instead of trying to be a hundred other things.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Well, because there's something he is getting right. There is something no one in Cheliax is getting right except maybe Aspexia Rugatonn, and Aspexia Rugatonn can't teach it, even if she knows it, because if she could then everything would be different. There's a kind of way of living in the world that Keltham has, and they don't, and he saw immediately what a tragedy that was and wanted to teach it to&nbsp;<em>literally everyone&nbsp;</em>because - not because he's Good, he's not, he's a lot more Good than people here because his surroundings were but she can actually tell the difference and he's not -</p>
              <p>But you don't have to be Good to see a - mess, a Lawless mess if you'd like, and to wish that the beings in it stood taller, smarter, clarified and free, not as good as when they had no free will maybe but at least out of the local equilibrium where they have it <em>but are not competent to use it -</em></p>
              <p>He's also a teenager in way over his head and missing half the information he needs and depending which skills he grows in which order he's very possibly going to demand, when Cheliax comes clean with him, that everyone involved in the decision to deceive him be tortured to death, which would be reasonable, but -</p>
              <p>- she wants to sleep with Keltham because she wants everything he has, and she wants to see more pieces of him, and she wants it very, very badly. And she sits with that, and lets it fill her up, the longing to see the end of the path, the longing to&nbsp;<em>tell&nbsp;</em>him things and watch him&nbsp;<em>think&nbsp;</em>about them - to check the little Keltham she is building in her head against the real thing and see if she <em>gets</em> it yet -</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There. That's better. She goes to dinner.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>"So, plus side, the way I was put together was not-too-bad for dath ilan and almost certainly all-wrong for Golarion, and being stuck like that while refusing to look at exactly what I was doing wrong probably wouldn't have turned out great for me.&nbsp; On the minus side, before the Owl's Wisdom wore off, my brain went and fully admitted to itself that I had no hope of ever succeeding in my life goals back in dath ilan, and I did not really need that much personality update being shoved at me all at the same time, you know, it would have been nicer to spread it out over a few more weeks."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham can feel it like an echo of Owl's Wisdom, his explicit <em>awareness,</em> his inability not to look in that direction, towards his perception that everything he's heard about the afterlife has been <em>very</em> vague; and the explicit thought now completed, that this is probably not some random innocent mistake it's okay to ignore while he plunges ahead into everything else that's more tractable.</p>
              <p>He wishes he knew whether or not the truth about afterlives was being <em>deliberately </em><em>hidden</em> from him by the people here, or hidden by gods from living nongods in this afterlife-feeding economy, or if this is some safer issue where it'd work fine to try harder to pin people down on details at the expense of some social capital.</p>
              <p>He doesn't want to pin Carissa down on it, anyways.&nbsp; It's not a fun pre-date topic.</p>
              <p>"Sorry if I shouldn't ask, by the way, but I can't tell if your mention of meeting somebody more important than Contessa Lrilatha was a prompt to ask you about that if I was interested, or if it was deliberately vague to signal that I'm not supposed to ask."</p>

"So, Osirion. Osirion has a god-king, a pharaoh, they've had them since ancient times. The pharaoh of Osirion has hundreds of concubines. If he sees a hot girl in the street, I think he can just order her to become one of them. It's not particularly validating to be chosen by the pharaoh of Osirion, because it just means that you're either in the top couple hundred or that he was tired of the top couple hundred and wanted something new. I am absolutely not in the top percentile of hotness for women but if I went to Osirion I'd be a little worried about getting noticed, because I'm exotic, which is sometimes appealing in its own right.</p>

              <p>"I think you are imagining that this equilibrium is extremely fragile and that admitting we're in it is also disallowed? But actually it's extremely sticky. Overthrowing governments is really really hard and usually the thing that results when you overthrow a government is much worse. The consequences of overthrowing the Chelish government would be bad ones. So you don't have to - pretend the government is perfect - you just have to have a critical mass of people who don't believe that overthrowing it would produce something better, especially not since the Chelish government <em>is&nbsp;</em>possible to improve in normal ways by, like, suggesting improvements."</p>

              <p>Keltham manages not to yell this out loud, and having now finished internally yelling insults at reality, continues looking externally thoughtful, grateful for his recent practice with Eagle's Splendour.</p>
              <p>He is not going to say anything along those lines, however obvious, until he has picked up from books whether <em>Cheliax</em> has a pharaoh.&nbsp; Or rather, what kind of pharaoh it has.</p>
              <p>He is specifically not going to mention that, given a dath ilani training regimen, ten-year-olds are too smart to get stuck in traps like this; and would wait until the next solar eclipse or earthquake, at which point 10% of them would yell "NOW!", followed moments later by the other 90%, as is the classic strategy that <em>children spontaneously and independently invent</em> as soon as prompted by this scenario, so long as they have been previously taught about Schelling points.</p>
              <p>Has he at any point mentioned out loud dath ilan's annual Oops It's Time To Overthrow The Government Festival?&nbsp; He doesn't think so.</p>

              <p>...if you introduce technology into a Punish-Non-Punishers society with magic, the situation is no longer stable, it has a <em>possibility</em> of transitioning to the kind of pharaoh-free Civilization that Keltham is familiar with, if very large supply networks (and only those) can build weapons powerful enough to kill high-level wizards and clerics.&nbsp; But, yeah, Keltham is going to have to think about how to do that with a minimum of fuss, and maybe not say a whole lot while he's thinking.</p>

              <p>"Anyway, sometimes it does go wrong and someone's power base isn't secure enough. Like in Tian Xia, the Lung Wa empire which had endured for centuries collapsed after Aroden's death because there was a massive associated natural disaster and a famine, and the empire collapsed, and everything is <em>much worse now</em>. I've met Tian adventurers and they tell stories about - ghost cities where everyone just left or died because trade routes were disrupted and food stopped coming, an entire country that made a pact with a kraken to be its slaves, other areas where the civil war&nbsp;<em>still hasn't ended&nbsp;</em>even though there are very few people left to kill each other. I am sure that the Emperor of Imperial Lung Wa did some things you'd abhorr but - it'd be monstrous, to overthrow him, to throw cities and civilizations and twenty million lives into the chasm of Chaos just to stop a couple dozen people from getting raped -"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Point two:&nbsp; Not only has Keltham not been told about this, Keltham has never been exposed to any sexual education or priming which would cause him to think, if he did notice this fact about himself, that it was a good idea to pursue that thought further. &nbsp;People don't want to be hurt; that is sort of what hurting is.</p>
              <p>Having a strong sexual desire to inflict pain, according to everything that dath ilan has taught Keltham about the world, would mean that any attempt to satisfy this desire would involve an unusually mentally resilient sex worker being paid a <em>lot</em> of money to put up with a sexual experience that she didn't like.&nbsp; If he got addicted, if his whole sexuality turned into that, the rest of his romantic life would suck really hard and probably never be truly satisfying again.&nbsp; That would have been the obvious prediction, going on the obvious-intuitive reasoning Keltham would have done from everything Civilization ever taught him.</p>
              <p>The thought that the world was full of other people who were the complements of that desire, who <em>wanted to be sexily hurt,</em> would just straightforwardly have never occurred to Keltham at all, if he'd spotted that desire in himself.</p>

The natural default mode for exploring is more - cautious, giggly, childlike, and that is appealing in its own way - maybe to Keltham too - but not sexy, and she's going to be kind of dissatisfied if -</p>
              <p>- one thing at a time. The massive entryhall staircase opens out onto a luxurious mezzanine and then there are two wings with rooms, presumably parlors and bedrooms and guest rooms and so on, and no obvious staircase up, though she knows that this place has some towers.

That person would get smiled at and the smile wouldn't be any information actually. But - but you're going to tell me that a dath ilani, even an Evil one, wouldn't do that, aren't you, I don't know why they wouldn't do that but<em> you</em> wouldn't do that -"</p>

              <p>She will die horribly if she turns Keltham against Cheliax. Anything that's true of all Golarion isn't that, and she's pretty sure that nowhere in Golarion do powerful men want the women they're sleeping with to communicate needing things to happen differently.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She will die horribly and worse afterwards if she ends up wholly persuaded of Keltham's worldview and not suitable as an instrument of Hell anymore. But her first foolish foray into Keltham's worldview was, Asmodeus thought, worthwhile, so - maybe she has a bit of slack there, presumably he wouldn't have expended those resources for someone who couldn't find the right path even when she was trying. And she hasn't gone and asked the cleric her questions yet. Maybe it's okay to try to understand the dath ilan way of thinking and separately try to understand the Asmodean one and then integrate them. If she can't understand dath ilan she won't be able to do her job.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Keltham will at some point figure stuff out - not all the stuff, but some stuff. He's already figured some things out just from the fact Chelish students conceal distress during class. The ideas that look right next to each other, to him, are different; they won't be able to predict which things are right next to other things unless they get really good at dath ilan-ness themselves. To him, 'people smile during class' was right next to 'you might not actually want to be here', not that he has the imagination to have realized the&nbsp;<em>ways&nbsp;</em>she might be here if she didn't want to be.</p>
              <p>It feels like there are walls closing in from all sides, and -</p>
              <p>"Might someone consult a Keeper?" she says. "If they were dath ilani and very stuck and very confused even about the origins of their own confusion."</p>
