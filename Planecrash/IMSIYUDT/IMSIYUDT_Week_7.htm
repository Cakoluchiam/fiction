            <div class='post-content'><p>To make sure everybody starts out on the same page, Keltham will quickly summarize earlier conversations for the benefit of any harem members who might not have been in hearing range for it.&nbsp; He still isn't distinguishing them all that well and didn't actually count them, if somebody was in the washroom or something.&nbsp; He definitely knows Carissa was absent for some of it.</p>
              <p>Things Keltham summarizes:</p>
              <p>- Keltham is not sure how important it actually is to understand where everything you know is situated within the order of larger reality, but dath ilan sure does situate all of it, and maybe that's important, he doesn't know.&nbsp; Hopefully he doesn't have to burn more than a couple of hours here and there on situating things.<br>- Most adult dath ilani are running around thinking that they know the universe's age to within 0.1% and all the names and qualities of its tiny parts that haven't been reduced to even tinier parts. &nbsp;The very smart people of dath ilan (actually the prediction markets but he'll explain that in more detail later) have predicted how this could otherwise make people weak and unable to handle mental adversity, which is why the adults play a lot of confusing pranks on children, in case they someday end up in Golarion or something.&nbsp; Like, they weren't literally anticipating this exact event, or they'd have gone a lot <em>harder</em> on his pranks.&nbsp; But it sure is why Keltham is hitting the ground running instead of curling up in a ball whining about structural uncertainty.<br>- And similarly:&nbsp; Even ordinary life means sometimes facing questions you don't know how to answer. &nbsp;Doing basic research means facing questions whose answers are <em>very </em>unlike all the questions and answers you've studied before.&nbsp; Keltham regrets to inform Cheliax that only asking kids questions they already know how to answer, seems like it would obviously leave them weak and unprepared for real intellectual challenges.&nbsp; He's pretty sure this is true of people at their own intelligence level, less sure about people with average or below-average intelligence for Golarion.<br>- Keltham does apologize for presenting his students with confusing questions, when they weren't used to that, had no idea why he was doing that, and also didn't have any meta-idea of why he'd be doing stuff they didn't understand.<br>- Keltham will try to remember to check in verbally about how people are doing, since Chelish pride permits verbal answers about that but seems to prohibit overt visual displays of confusion.&nbsp; If Keltham seems to be forgetting to do this, he hopes somebody will remind him in words even if Cheliax considers that slightly undignified.&nbsp; As an older kid teaching younger kids, he expected the younger kids to give much more overt signals of how well he was doing as a teacher.<br>- Dath ilan doesn't have magical healing and they sure don't have resurrections.&nbsp; Hence, despite all their intellectual toughening procedures, they don't have any equivalent of, like, teaching kids how to walk on broken legs so that they can mentally divorce physical pain from long-term damage.&nbsp; If Cheliax trains its kids to be strong in that particular way, Keltham has not gone through this training yet, and this is probably not the right time either.<br>- Correspondingly, if inflicting physical pain is considered an important element in Cheliax of training subconscious intuitions, Keltham has no idea how to do that professionally, and hopes they'll excuse him from it.&nbsp; Keltham separately may end up making a case that rewards often work better than punishments, because you can scale rewards directly to performance instead of a problematic notion of 'are people doing their best', plus the brain learns from forgone rewards similarly in many ways to punishment; but he'd have to understand this entire system better, before he started feeling confident about critiquing that element specifically.<br>- It does seem specifically worrisome to Keltham that in a punishment-based system you'd have to worry about people taking safer, less challenging lessons and trying not to give outward signs that their potential was high enough to do better, if their subconscious was learning to avoid pain inflicted for doing less than their best.&nbsp; Maybe he's totally off-base in worrying about that and Cheliax has already solved it somehow.&nbsp; But the reason Keltham is bringing that up immediately, is to emphasize that he is going to continue throwing confusing questions at them and <em>this is not meant to be a threatening overly difficult problem whose painful failures they need to avoid,</em> it's meant to be an overly difficult problem they can safely hang out around and safely fail on without that hurting.<br>- It'd be <em>particularly</em> dumb if Keltham started throwing more difficult problems at them, they got hurt more for failing or just got&nbsp;<em>scared</em> of failing, and some deep part of their brain learned the lesson that facing actual confusing cognitive problems is scarier and more painful than facing easy fake cognitive problems.&nbsp; That is why Keltham now emphasizes the point that, whatever problems they were trying to solve in their education before this, object-level failure will be punished less; because this is new to them, and their best is worse than it was on easier problems; also because Keltham doesn't know how to teach that way at all; and, above all, success on these new harder problems is <em>more valuable</em> and during equity negotiations he will ensure that it is <em>accordingly</em> <em>better paid</em>.</p>

              <p>Also, after his experience with how Chelish education is configured, and having been told where the average Intelligence on this planet has ended up, he feels some degree of concern, and a need to check that current heritage-optimization programs are not being run, like... backwards.&nbsp; (Keltham says this out loud too.)</p>
              <p>Before he launches into his own lecture, what're Cheliax's current knowledge or hypotheses about heredity, and how have they set up whatever current heritage-optimization programs they're running for crops, domesticated animals, and people?</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Cheliax knows that children inherit traits from their parents. The dominant theory is that girls mostly inherit psychological traits from their mothers and boys from their fathers, based on how it works in the species of marshbirds where a famous wizard did a bunch of seminal breeding experiments, but some people think humans are more like dogs in inheriting from both parents; certainly in skin and hair humans can take after either parent. Humans hybridize with elves, drow, orcs, sylphs, and hybridize inconsistently (offspring rare, often sterile) with angels, devils, and elementals polymorphed humanoid, and don't hybridize with halflings or gnomes or catfolk or gnolls or giants or goblins or merfolk. Human hybrids with elves are half-elves and with orcs are half-orcs, but human hybrids by dwarves if they live at all will fully resemble dwarves, and be sterile.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Cheliax is divided on whether to try to reduce the percentage of children who die of disease, for reasons related to heredity: toughness is heritable, and if you start saving the half of kids that currently die possibly you'll be raising a generation of adults with fundamental weaknesses in their blood which they'll pass along such that future generations get weaker and weaker. That seems like one way you could run a heritage-optimization program backwards and they're not doing that.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Cheliax pays students who graduated with good grades from wizard school to have children, though talented wizards usually have lots of ways to make money and it's more about communicating that they're doing a thing valuable to Cheliax than about shifting their financial incentives much. Wizards actually have fewer children than other people because they can choose whether they become pregnant and other people can't, but Keltham's reportedly going to introduce technology to let everyone do that, which should help on that front?</p>

              <p>It seems like you'd make people as Lawful as you could if you were making them and it's not clear why that'd be Lawfuler for women than for men.

And presumably if enough people did that then eventually daughters would become valuable again, as the men wanted wives. So you'd end up with as many living women as made daughters as valuable as sons. Or with across the board infanticide if no children were valuable to have.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>(Keltham reminds himself again that the whole afterlife thing is obviously going to lead to different local mores about death, just as the existence of healing magic has led to different local mores about pain; killing babies here does not mean the same thing that killing or cryo-suspending babies would in dath ilan.&nbsp; It wouldn't be surprising if the whole pre-afterlife world operates as a tiny adjunct to a much larger afterlife, only of note to gods and a higher economy because it's the part of reality that provides the afterlife with its intake feed.&nbsp; Some of the attitudes ascribed to countries outside Cheliax definitely give that impression.)</p>
              <p>(Keltham also notes that Carissa seems to be able to follow the thread of an argument better than others here.&nbsp; He's not used to thinking of that as an <em>adult</em> capability per se, but maybe it takes a lot more life experience to follow threads of argument if you have, like, very little formal training in it.)</p>
              <p>"Ah, well, if you value having more of&nbsp;<em>your own</em> children, then, if the human species had been designed to birth ten times as many female children as male, you might wish yourself to have more male children.&nbsp; It would not necessarily be any better in terms of producing a functioning <em>species; </em>the species could get along fine with each male having to do ten times as much work of fertilizing women.&nbsp; It doesn't take that long, well, if you're doing it right, it takes longer, but not so long that a male couldn't fertilize another female the next day.&nbsp; Still, if the rest of your species gave birth to ten times as many women as men, and yet you could manage to birth only men yourself, you would have a lot more <em>grandchildren</em> than the average women."</p>
              <p>"And yet what difference does any of&nbsp;<em>that</em> make?&nbsp; What difference does it make, as to what some woman wants to herself, when it comes to how the human species works as a whole?&nbsp; At least in dath ilan, women cannot choose the sex of their child by just an act of will.&nbsp; Then how can their wants control the balance of female and male births across the whole species?&nbsp; I'll tell you right now, the answer isn't that there is some mysterious channel by which the emotions of women collectively control the balance of births; you might have to look at things a little sideways to get it.&nbsp; But even if you can't get it, guess anyways -"</p>
              <p>"Oh, and don't forget, if you can guess why your guess might be wrong, say that part too!&nbsp; You're not trying to <em>convince</em> me of your guess - this isn't like wacky Chelish books - you're not trying to tell me just one side of a story, like you're selling me your guess as a product and trying to get a higher price on it by concealing information while hoping I don't realize you're concealing information.&nbsp; I mean, if you want to sell me anything in real life, sell me on how good you are at <em>reasoning.</em>&nbsp; That means when you tell me your best guess, you should try to figure out how your best guess might be wrong; if you can see why it's probably wrong, if you can already see something that doesn't fit with your guess, tell me that part too.&nbsp; Remember, when real life hands you a problem, it <em>won't tell you</em> when you guess wrong, the way a teacher in a classroom tells you when you're wrong.&nbsp; In actual real life it's <em>your</em> job to figure out why your best guess might still be wrong.&nbsp; Dath ilani teachers let kids stay wrong about some things for <em>years,</em> and older kids are forbidden to tell younger kids about them."</p>

              <p>"Right.&nbsp; Any time you've got pressures on something, moving it, it'll keep moving for so long as the pressures aren't balanced.&nbsp; Half male and half female represents a balance of <em>something,</em> which is why it's like that - but what is it that's balancing?&nbsp; We have thoughts like 'well, if it was ten times as many women as men, or ten times as many men as women, then a women who had all male children or all female children would have more grandchildren'.&nbsp; But that doesn't explain how it's a&nbsp;<em>pressure</em> - how it would be able to&nbsp;<em>move the system's mix of men and women,</em> if that mix wasn't already one-to-one.&nbsp; How can we get from 'in a country with ten times as many women as men, one woman with all male children would have ten times as many grandchildren', to, 'there is a <em>pressure</em> that will&nbsp;<em>move the average ratio of men and women</em> if it isn't already 1:1'?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"You're on the right track.&nbsp; Remember some things I told you earlier, about tiny spirals inside people; remember that those hidden orders are <em>real</em> and not just stories, or at least they were definitely real in dath ilan, and probably also here given that the food hasn't already killed me.&nbsp; Inside every human body, there are tiny spirals that code how a body works, themselves divided into twenty-three pairs of packages.&nbsp; One of those package-pairs is the sex package-pair, or <em>chromosome pair</em>&nbsp;in Baseline..."</p>
              <p>Keltham sketches out the sex chromosomes, XY for male, XX for female.&nbsp; A child gets one chromosome in each chromosome-pair from each parent, allocated by the parent at random.</p>
              <p>"But if you imagine a new genetic-alternative, <em>mutation,</em> which influenced the ratio of sperm containing Y chromosomes or X chromosomes - or a mutation in the mother, which influenced whether male or female pre-infants were kept and gestated - that mutation wouldn't have to be a mutation in the sex chromosomes in particular.&nbsp; A man could have sons that were more likely, though not certain, to have more other sons, and even the daughters of those men might still have male children of their own that had more sons.&nbsp; The force of <em>possible heritable mutations that would throw a different mix</em> is the pressure that only ever reaches a balancing point at one-to-one males to females."</p>
              <p>"Or rather, to be precise, the balance is one-to-one <em>parental investment</em> in males and females.&nbsp; If females were half the size of men and required half as much parental attention and grew two to a birth, so that you could raise two females at the same cost as one male, the balancing point would be two women per men; you wouldn't be able to do better by birthing more men because men would be more <em>expensive.</em>&nbsp; If you see an animal species that <em>isn't</em> half male and half female, the first thing to ask is whether the males or females are bigger or smaller or fewer survive to adulthood or there's otherwise some big difference in how expensive they are to birth and raise to maturity."</p>
              <p>"But there's a larger point and a more important one.&nbsp; The balancing point isn't the point that's good for the species, the country, as a whole.&nbsp; It's not the point you would pick if you were a supergod making the species from scratch.&nbsp; If you were doing that as a supergod, you'd probably have ten times as many women as men, and then just make it incredibly biologically difficult to ever birth all men - try to design the people so that no mutation could possibly affect the balance of ten women per men.&nbsp; More members of the species would be able to birth children.&nbsp; Or to look at it from another angle, you might also wonder whether a <em>group</em> or <em>small faction </em>birthing mostly women, would have an advantage over a group with half men and half women - if the mostly-female group could grow faster, because more of its members could bear children, or because it didn't have to pay the extra cost in food of supporting men too.&nbsp; But then a group like that would also be vulnerable to an invading mutation that birthed more men; that mutation would rapidly spread&nbsp;<em>within</em> the group.&nbsp; You can look at the sex ratio in humans, half men and half women, and say things like, 'Oh, I see that the balancing points between competing genes do not settle at the place that is good for <em>groups</em> having more children, it settles in the places that are advantageous for <em>individuals</em> having more children.'"</p>
              <p>"And then everything else you see inside a human should settle in a similar kind of place, or it won't be stable against the pressure from mutated alternatives.&nbsp; That's <em>why</em> you want to prosper for yourself, instead of being full of unselfish desire to see your whole country prosper.&nbsp; It's why I need to offer you money to work for me, instead of you just working for the benefit of Golarion or Cheliax.&nbsp; A faction full of individuals all working for the common good would grow faster, obtain more resources and have more kids, and you might think a mutation which built people like that would soon take over the world.&nbsp; But as soon as that faction was invaded by a mutation in an individual that worked for their own benefit, that mutation would soon become more common; it wouldn't be a stable balancing point <em>in the sort of species that ends up with half males and half females.</em> &nbsp;Insect species, like ants if you have those here, which you probably do if there's a word for ants, have lots of worker ants all laboring for the benefit of an ant hive; they don't have equal investment in males and females.&nbsp; Ants can be balanced in different places because ants reproduce differently and workers share more genes with their queens."</p>
              <p>"I wouldn't be surprised if the event that you remember historically as humans gaining free will, was the gods trying to modify people to work unselfishly for gods or maybe the gods' factions, like ants; but over time mutations accumulated in the human population that made them <em>resistant</em> to that magical template, and restored the old balancing points, where people cared about themselves instead.&nbsp; Or maybe the gods stopped doing it for some other reason, I don't know, I'm new around here.&nbsp; Oh, and I should say, the balancing points aren't purely selfish.&nbsp; You share half your genes with your parents, half your genes with your children, and an average of around half your genes with your brothers and sisters; you have some instinct to help them, though not quite as strongly as you wish to help yourself.&nbsp; My point is that, if you know how all the pieces of reality are woven together, if you know the hidden orders and secret stories behind them, you can take one glance at the statistics of women giving birth, see that it's half male children and half female children, and guess, 'I bet the people in this species mostly want pay for their work, and don't mostly work unselfishly for the good of the group like ants; I bet they care a lot about their brothers and sisters, but not nearly so much about their second cousins.&nbsp; The pressures-on-heredity in this species must balance at the point where <em>individuals</em> and&nbsp;<em>small families</em> can't easily get more grandchildren with a different strategy, not at the point where <em>larger </em><em>groups</em> can't get more grandchildren with a different strategy.'&nbsp; And I could similarly guess very quickly that you hadn't been put together from scratch by gods or supergods, just from the way you acted so similar to dath ilani at a basic level, because gods wouldn't be bound by those balancing points the same way."</p>
              <p>"I should probably pause here and check whether you have any questions, whether you followed all that, and whether I'm currently committing any visible horrible teaching errors that make a Chelish student's life less pleasant."</p>

              <p>You'd think raising kids in Cheliax would be sufficient to make them not stunningly naive but apparently it isn't, Elias Abarco mutters through the telepathic bond with his colleagues. The girls are hanging off Keltham's every word with a degree of conviction that they ought to realize is borderline dangerous - at best trying to figure out how everything else they've been told is compatible with what they're hearing now, instead of keeping in mind that maybe Keltham's just not Asmodean and won't teach them to be either. Or they're very good liars. Probably for at least some of them, it's the latter - though it's a very good presentation, optimized for Elias rather than for Keltham, who is definitely missing nearly all of its nuances.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Keltham won't teach them to be Asmodean. That's obvious. Presumably part of what they're here for is to figure out whether there's a variant of Keltham's teachings that will teach kids to be Asmodean, the obvious intelligence and societal competence distilled differently, presented in a way that preserves the awe-inducing sense of 'that's what it's like, for the world to be designed around principles that you'd have to be much smarter to even begin to understand' while also preserving the stuff that'd ideally go with it - a sense of smallness and irrelevance which dath ilan clearly does not bother inculcating...</p>
              <p>Maybe some of the girls can be set to coming up with the synthesis, once they've been nailed down. The plan is to get them tomorrow before dawn, possibly excluding Sevar who might spend the night with Keltham and, if so, can be got at breakfast. This isn't Asmodeanism but it does seem like there's a better-crafted, more compelling version of Asmodeanism buried in it, once you strip out the stuff that's plainly aimed at advancing the art rather than awing children into submission with it.</p>

              <p>Ione Sala isn't smiling as much on the inside because she's regretting, a little, that her life is like it is.&nbsp; She does well on tests, it's why she's here, that and being passably pretty.&nbsp; She carefully doesn't compete too hard in social contests, she aims to end up safely in the middle.&nbsp; She behaves just as it is safest to behave, towards the students above her and below her, including sexual favors as they are given away to those below her who are useful, or extracted from her by those above her.&nbsp; She passes her loyalty scans by being a cautiously obedient game-player even in her own mind, a sort of person that Cheliax considers adequately standard and predictable, a sort of soul that Asmodeus considers to be an acceptably tyrannized slave.&nbsp; It is the way that things have always been and will always be.&nbsp; If any parts of her feel otherwise, they are not allowed to voice their heretical thoughts in words; though she also knows, wordlessly in the back of her mind, that if she's a good-enough wizard someday Cheliax will ask her to sell her soul and after that it will be okay to think more freely.</p>
              <p>Still some tiny remaining fraction of Ione Sala, even today, wishes without words or inner acknowledgment that her life could be more like the greater reality she's dimly glimpsed inside a repurposed library in an Archduke's villa: learning things, knowing how one fact connects to so many other facts, seeing how worlds differ across planes.</p>

Keltham thinks he was told 18, though at levels like these, the difference between 17.5 and 18.5 is significant, but let's say his Intelligence is exactly 18 for now.&nbsp; Though it feels funny to call himself "Intelligence 18", since in dath ilan's system, the average <em>g </em>is 0 and Keltham is at +0.8.&nbsp; Somebody with a dath ilani <em>g </em>of 18 would have a dath ilani Intelligence of "46".&nbsp; But let's ignore for now how the dath ilani system is obviously better and closer to the underlying math.</p>
              <p>So anyways:&nbsp; Is this alien visitor likely to be of any special benefit to heredity-optimization in Cheliax and Golarion, compared with just matching the same potential volunteers with a local man of Intelligence 18?&nbsp; Is he worth anything <em>special</em> from the Chelish government's standpoint?</p>
              <p>Pretend you were just collectively tapped to advise the Chelish government on this, and can't ask Keltham directly!&nbsp; Also try to pretend that you're a dath ilani whose life experience trains them to continue thinking in the face of questions your teachers didn't tell you how to answer, including the part where you know and list the reasons you might be wrong.</p>

              <p>"And then, if tests like that show an effect of routine Restoration on intelligence development, you know that the general population has any kind of significant problem that Restoration cures, and you can start trying to narrow down what the problem is and how to cure it <em>without</em> needing to spend precious cleric spells on Restorationing every member of the population."</p>
              <p>"The larger attitude I want to teach you is that&nbsp;<em>everything around you is an investigative tool.</em>&nbsp; There's a famous dath ilani fictional character who spent too much time fighting and now thinks in terms of how every object in a room could be used as a weapon.&nbsp; This is that, but for&nbsp;<em>figuring things out.</em>&nbsp; Your first thought was that, since Restoration cured people, maybe you could use it to solve your problem and cure everybody in the Chelish population.&nbsp; Before&nbsp;<em>solving</em> problems comes&nbsp;<em>figuring out</em> problems, and the first step there is to <em>open your eyes and look</em>.&nbsp; Everything around you is a tool for investigation, it is a potential way to poke other things and reveal facts about them.&nbsp; Restoration isn't just a way of curing people of a set of problems, it's an investigation tool for seeing <em>whether observable qualities of people are being affected by things that Restoration cures.</em>&nbsp; First, open your eyes and look; and ask how every resource you have and everything in the world around you can be an eye."</p>

              <p>Well, people hybridize with some other humanoid species by getting traits from both, and hybridize with some species by getting traits from just one, and hybridize with some by not turning out at all. So it might be true that hybridization across ethnicities is like that, where you get a mix, or you might get something that's not quite in between, like you get if you fuck a polymorphed air elemental, the kid isn't half air, they're just something else entirely. You'd be checking to see how people hybridize, more or less.</p>

"If you mix two eighteens you probably get an eighteen, on average, but - but it's much more valuable to get a sixteen and a twenty than two eighteens, because the twenty can end up running the country - if Chelish people and Tian people have the same bits making them smarter, then they'll have the same variance mixed, but if they have different bits then they'll have higher variance."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"I am genuinely not sure how to introduce this topic if you have never encountered it before, but sometimes in real life, a group of people have to work towards a common goal, and at the end get some payout in common that they have to divide up - according to previously agreed-upon rules, if they were smart.&nbsp; Games can work like that too, and <em>should,</em> if they're trying to mirror that kind of reality. &nbsp;Chelish Governance is going to be trying to <em>make</em> the game work like that, that's sort of the whole point of having a government in the first place."</p>
              <p>"The other thing that's missing is that you don't - seem to have a current notion of what you're trying to&nbsp;<em>find out</em> from the game - you know, I think I may be doing this wrong and not providing you with enough direction literally the first time you're doing this.&nbsp; You play games with older kids leading, before you get handed some problem that requires you to invent a game for younger kids to play with you.&nbsp; Well, I may just be motivated to think that because of my personal interest in having this particular topic taught quickly; still, the rationalization seems valid after having been invented."</p>
              <p>"So!&nbsp; Things you could be testing in this game include <em>alternate rules</em> that Chelish governance could give the players about subsidies and rewards, which would lead players each trying to maximize their own score, to do useful things for heritage-optimization.&nbsp; And now it's occurring to me that maybe you don't already have this concept, maybe people here just make up laws that sound like good ideas and don't play games to figure out what the laws will do in their effects on selfish people.&nbsp; In which case I also have to, at some point, convey basic competence for <em>figuring out what effects different legal systems would have and optimizing better laws,</em> which, the complete wreckage of what my own people consider Lawfulness in Golarion, should maybe have suggested to me earlier was also going to end up a Project issue, <em>but never mind one thing at a time.</em>"</p>
              <p>"The other thing you were going to investigate was the effect of adding one person with&nbsp;<em>different</em> bits of heritage to the system.&nbsp; So for now, just make up some fixed rules about points that players score by having smarter characters in their hand, let's say there's at most three characters you can keep in your hand at one time, and your objective is&nbsp;<em>not</em> to score&nbsp;<em>higher than other players,</em> it's just to score&nbsp;<em>as many points as possible for yourself.</em>&nbsp; Characters can be male or female at random; men can have any number of children in a lifetime, women can have only three children per lifetime.&nbsp; When any two players mate their characters, they have to agree in advance on which player will retain the resulting offspring.&nbsp; Any time a mating occurs between two characters <em>one </em>of whom has over ten smarts, the Chelish government pays an extra point to whichever player doesn't end up owning the resulting offspring.&nbsp; Any time a mating occurs between two characters&nbsp;<em>both</em> with over ten smarts, the Chelish government pays an extra three points to whichever player doesn't end up owning the resulting offspring.&nbsp; At the end of the game, everybody gets a bonus equal to total smarts divided by ten, which mirrors the real-life fact that smart people don't capture all of the value they create for themselves and that smarter societies end up generally richer even for the nonsmart people in them; and remember, your in-game goal is to maximize your total points for yourself, not worry at all about how many points other players are scoring..."&nbsp; Keltham goes on sketching some additional rules intended to make the game mirror real-life genetics, and real-life incentives under conditions of government subsidy.</p>
              <p>Each player gets one free mating at the start of the game with the 'Thamkel' character, which is the only one that has any 'smart' or 'dumb' values at the fourth locus of each chromosome - all other characters have 'neutral' at the fourth locus.&nbsp; 'Thamkel' also has only neutral values at the first locus, where other characters can have 'smart' or 'dumb' there.&nbsp; This reflects the way that Thamkel has some <em>different&nbsp;</em>varying bits.&nbsp; You can't legally mate two Thamkel offspring during the first two generations afterwards.&nbsp; There are a few other characters as smart as Thamkel, but only Thamkel has any variation in the fourth locus for each chromosome.<br><br></p>
              <p>And then Keltham observes what happens under the new game conditions.&nbsp; Do they - sort of get the point of the simulation, now, or the incentives?&nbsp; At all?</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Unfortunately, I can't promise this scenario is at&nbsp;<em>all</em> realistic.&nbsp; The results you got were ones that I knew you'd get; the game simplified things to where, more or less, the main thing driving the results was how much variance, squared-deviation, you had to select on.&nbsp; The games with Thamkel gave you four-thirds as much variation to work with as the games without him, and that's basically the answer you got.&nbsp; That said, though the game was simplified, that part should be more or less true about real genetics according to the real math; the real math says that the rate of selection on a characteristic goes as the covariance between the variance of that characteristic and variance in fitness."</p>
              <p>"I could have just proved that, but I thought it was more important to show you a methodology that works for getting a quick perspective on modeling something in an hour, when you <em>don't</em> know how to prove a general mathematical result inside that hour.&nbsp; Even the abstract math wouldn't take into account things like the division of the genes into twenty-three package-pairs, and until we played this game with four package-pairs, it would be hard to tell from looking at the more abstract path whether that was a critical thing to model."</p>
              <p>"Is it realistic that the game with Thamkel has four-thirds as much variation to select on?&nbsp; That's the critical question, and unfortunately, that part I don't know.&nbsp; I <em>wish</em> I could remember <a href="https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1442879751706664963">what percentage of population variance an average dath ilani is carrying, or figure out how many alternative alleles besides that would have been fixed in your population, versus my population, over the unknown time since dath ilan diverged from whatever human biology got here</a>.&nbsp; With my own world's technology, we could spot-check the tiny spirals directly, see how different they were, figure out how much they'd diverged, and get a good guess how long ago it had happened chronologically.&nbsp; But I can't do that, and I don't remember even some of the relevant figures that I've actually seen."</p>
              <p>"The end result could be anywhere between 'Keltham is worth a five percent boost to how much heritage optimization we can get over a millennium' to 'Keltham has most of a whole other plane's worth of intelligence-promoting alleles that differ from our own pool and that gives us twice as many beneficial mutations to work with' or even, though this would be extreme, 'Keltham quadruples the amount of variance we have to work with, because the cumulative differences between his plane and our plane are four times larger than the pool of important mutations we were selecting on locally, and selection starts going four times as fast for a while a hundred years later.'"</p>
              <p>"But, let's be real here, unless I'm somehow worth <em>much </em>less than I look on the surface of the game, the Chelish government cannot realistically pay me as much as my genes are worth to Golarion a thousand years later.&nbsp; And also, let's be real, I didn't exactly do all the work of dath ilan that selected people like me into existence, even if my genes would usually be considered to be owned by myself; the percentage of generated value that I capture should maybe be legitimately less than if I was selling a book I wrote.&nbsp; So this is mostly a situation of eh, make me an offer for some unknown-size but probably civilization-level long-term boost.&nbsp; Plus <em>maybe</em> some unusually smart kids in the first generation, if a lucky draw from the higher-variance heritage-bits that go into a Chelish woman with high Intelligence play well with half of a dath ilani baseline."</p>
              <p>"Though I suspect the first generation's results may possibly see a drop instead, unfortunately, if it breaks up some package-combinations of established dath ilani genes that rely on each other.&nbsp; Or if my kids don't get the right nutrition, or if other kids start getting the right nutrition and catch up.&nbsp; You're not paying for a higher mean in the first generation than you could've gotten with an 18-Intelligence person from Tian, you're mainly paying for <em>higher variance between smart kids</em> over the next decades, centuries, and millennia.&nbsp; Which is a lot more valuable than you might realize without doing the math or playing the game.&nbsp; If the end result is that you get all of another world's good ideas from its tiny spirals, it really is quite valuable - but most of the value won't show up in the very first generation of remixing the package-pairs."</p>
              <p>"What's a fair value on that between friendly trade partners, in a world otherwise dancing on the edge of imminent destruction by the Worldwound?&nbsp; Good question, really.&nbsp; Unless your government tries to lowball the offer by an amount I consider insulting or silly, I doubt that's going to end up the real sticking point.&nbsp; I suspect a larger cause for hesitation is that I find myself selfishly concerned with what sort of life my kids will lead, including the ones who only end up with Intelligence sixteen - or even <em>fourteen</em> if that's how much variance is in play, and the first generation ends up breaking important combinations inside the dath ilani baseline genome.&nbsp; I mean, the kids who'd otherwise exist instead of my kids wouldn't be hugely better off, unless you'd otherwise have found mates much smarter than me, so all fine from a Good perspective.&nbsp; But I'm <em>not </em>Good and I know very little about this place and it is kind of a gigantic flaming mess and they'd be my kids - well, that's the sticking point from my own perspective."</p>
              <p>"But anyways, I have now conveyed to you, and so hopefully to Chelish Governance soon after, that basic knowledge of reality's underlying workings which is required to guess a valuation over the genes from an alien traveler with 18 Intelligence, including the elements of great uncertainty in models thereof.&nbsp; I await your government's offer, and perhaps more importantly, testable predictions over my offspring's future circumstances."</p>

              <p>"It happens to be really good for a certain kind of pest, and they grow to ten times their usual size and eat everyone in the village."</p>
              <p>"It smells irresistible to dragons."</p>
              <p>"It angers the fae."</p>
              <p>"It's so much more fertile than all other corn that it gets carried away on the wind and grows everywhere, blotting out all other life, until nothing grows anywhere on the continent but corn."</p>
              <p>"It's great for a couple years but it's sucking all the vitality out of the soil and leaves only sand behind."</p>
              <p>"It lures maneating rats from the Underdark and then the infestation is impossible to root out."</p>
              <p>"It grows six hundred feet in height and angers the aerial dragons."</p>
              <p>"Locusts that lay their eggs in it have an unnaturally high survival rate and so instead of occasional clouds of locusts we have constant clouds of locusts and they blot out the sun."</p>
              <p>"It's addictive and once you've eaten it you can't eat anything else."</p>
              <p>"It disrupts the flow of magical energies through the land beneath its roots and remaps all the ley lines in Cheliax, which causes a bunch of adjustment hurricanes and strands half the towns on the royal line."</p>
              <p>"It develops impossible geometry - the kind where looking at it gives you a headache - and anyone who wanders into the field come harvest time is lost forever."</p>
              <p>"It requires so much water that it sucks up water for hundreds of miles around, turning half of central Cheliax to desert."</p>
              <p>"It's actually just mediocre corn but with mind-control to make you think it's really great corn, and we're convinced we succeeded and plant it everywhere at which point it's powerful enough to enslave the whole country."</p>

              <p>"One reason I'm giving you this caution, obviously, is so that, if you do start getting results from more directed and clever heritage-optimization, you don't push your luck; the disease counterattack is close to a universal hazard if you start deriving too many children from too few parents."</p>
              <p>"The larger point is that&nbsp;<em>variation, itself, is a kind of resource.</em>&nbsp; It doesn't just apply to variation of disease-fighting systems, although that sure is one of the clearest cases of it.&nbsp; If you're tackling a difficult mental problem, and you've got five people on your team, adding a sixth person who thinks in a different way from the first five people is often a larger boost than adding somebody's previous acquaintance from a previous job who had a lot of similar life experience.&nbsp; There are also benefits to people knowing each other, to be clear, but the longer you've hammered on a problem without solving it, the more likely it is that you need somebody new."</p>
              <p>"The variation of your crops is a kind of resource that plant species has, making it more likely that at least some of it survives when it gets challenged with a new kind of weather, a new kind of pest.&nbsp; When you apply powerful breeding pressures to a crop and squeeze it through narrow bottlenecks of parentage, you lessen that variation as a side effect, and make the crop probably less resilient in some dimensions, even if you're improving it in others.&nbsp; Variation is a kind of resource for heritage optimization, and the process of heritage optimization uses some of it up."</p>
              <p>"This ties into something that, in dath ilan, is seen as a central dichotomy of all life's existence - a dichotomy between -"&nbsp; He needs to be careful in speaking here, so that the direct spell-supplied translation from the dath ilani terms into Taldane doesn't give away his point too early.&nbsp; "- <em>diversity</em>, and <em>optimality</em>.&nbsp; After all, if there's a&nbsp;<em>best</em> way to do things, wouldn't doing it any different way, necessarily be doing it worse?"</p>
              <p>"Think about the logic I showed you earlier today, the one which can derive exactly all of the actual consequences of the premises and no non-consequences of the premises.&nbsp; If you had a logic that was meaningfully different from that one, wouldn't it have to be, in some sense, worse?"</p>
              <p>"I pose to you this question, then, which I have not yet told you how to answer:&nbsp; Is diversity only ever valuable in places where we haven't found the <em>best </em>strategy?&nbsp; Is there necessarily some <em>optimal</em> disease-fighting system an organism could have, which could fight off every different form of disease that exists, and if an organism had that, it could be duplicated a million times without worry?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"All right, speaking more seriously now. &nbsp;It's easy to tangle yourself up with paradoxes of what is best, what is optimal, especially when you define the word even slightly different ways, see it from slightly different angles across two times you used the word. &nbsp;There's a mistake that young dath ilani make - skewing male rather than female, though also some girls and not all boys, of course - where they can't quite accept the fact that older children know more than they do and have higher measured cognitive powers, and some of them get fascinated with the ways that you can tangle up your reasoning and 'prove' that you're actually better than the older children because you're more ignorant than they are, or smarter than the optimal way of doing something."</p>
              <p>"It's one of the things where, when a boy makes a mistake like that, the older children and the Watchers don't try to talk him out of it, and let him go on believing it for a few years, so he can have his enjoyment and also learn a valuable life lesson when he's old enough to more carefully disentangle all of the paradoxes.&nbsp; This valuable lesson is that paradoxical-sounding questions have non-paradoxical answers, if you define everything precisely enough and don't mix up your words. &nbsp;Even if you cannot see the answer yet, you should expect that such an answer exists. &nbsp;Confusion exists in our minds, not in consistent mathematics."</p>
              <p>"In this case, I could formalize the solution by saying, for example, that there is such a thing as a best sequence of codes to try, given your state of knowledge about the lock, and that repeatedly trying the most likely first code forever is among the worst possible sequences. &nbsp;Or I could say that, since our knowledge changes with each observation, the best second code to try, given the results of observing the first code, is not equal to the best first code to try. &nbsp;This, I realize, may not sound particularly better than any of the other arguments you were using against silly-Keltham, but they fit into larger frameworks I can talk about later.&nbsp; A dath ilani would tell you that you're mistaken in thinking that there's no Lawful approach to guessing a code; you can use math to describe your beliefs about which codes have which probabilities of working, describe mathematically how those probabilities change with each observation as successive codes are ruled out, and that math then describes the next best guess.&nbsp; That doesn't mean you can do better by thinking explicitly in math, of course, instead of just quickly typing in possible passwords that seem likely; but the math does exist."</p>
              <p>"On a larger scale, the point I want to make again is about that dichotomy between optimality and diversity, the reason why you don't want to take a single stalk of corn and plant exact copies of it all over the country. &nbsp;When we talked about the case of the lock and its codes, we got two different angles on a way to resolve the children's paradox of it apparently not being best to just use the best answer.&nbsp; The first angle is that of the adaptive adversary, the corn blight, the master criminal considering the lock; the more regular we make our own answer, the more the adversary's adaptivity or intelligence is able to analyze and defeat it.&nbsp; We use randomization as a way to make it harder for their own intelligence to grasp; there's nothing paradoxical about the idea that, the more random something is, the less knowable it is, the more it may inconvenience some other mind.&nbsp; It's the kind of variation that's valuable in the disease-fighting systems inside human and corn, the kind that makes it harder for diseases to learn our defenses."</p>
              <p>"But the other viewpoint on the lock and code is the more important one.&nbsp; It's the reason why, if your team has been having trouble solving a problem for a while, you might want to add a new person who thinks less like the rest of you.&nbsp; It's a resource that a field of corn stalks has for adapting to a sudden shift in the environment, a new weather extreme; if the crop is more diverse, maybe some hardier stalks will survive to be replanted next year and then do better against that environment.&nbsp; It's the kind of variation where you're trying things in many places, and, because of that, trying <em>overly similar</em><em> things</em> in many places is something that yields less expected profit to you."</p>
              <p>"There are dimensions of society in which you want everyone behaving differently, so they can explore a space instead of all crowding together into one corner of it.&nbsp; There are dimensions of society where things go pretty well so long as you do something the correct way, and start to go poorly if you do things much differently than that.&nbsp; There is a tension in dath ilan between positions, between people and factions, between ideas and arguments, about that question - not just about particular cases, but about the sense in general of where all society should move on that spectrum.&nbsp; Whether it is more important in general for everyone to do things a bit more differently, in our future, or if the problem is more that we're falling too far below some standards and we all need to improve in those ways together.&nbsp; There are lots of particular cases in dath ilan where people might hold different opinions and not just one general opinion; but there <em>is</em> a sense that this general dimension of existence is one where the exact balance is important to a society."</p>
              <p>"Dath ilan has terminology for this dichotomy of strategies, between the search to find the optimal best answer and use it, versus trying many different answers to be more resilient against unknowns and explore a space more widely.&nbsp; Though I've been deliberately substituting the words 'optimal' and 'diverse', in this language, instead of the two Taldane words that the translation spell tries to automatically output."</p>
              <p>"If I say the dath ilani words directly, for these two directions a society can move along this dimension, they come out in this language as:"</p>
              <p>"Lawful."</p>
              <p>"And, Chaotic."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"I was on the side of Chaos, of course. &nbsp;Lawfulness seemed so very boring. &nbsp;I was quite sure we had enough of it already."</p>
              <p>"There's a saying in dath ilan that always sounded to me before like sententious pro-Law propaganda, whose depth of meaning, I think, I never really appreciated until I came to Golarion."</p>
              <p>"It's the saying that even Chaos is almost entirely made of Law."</p>
              <p>"Some variation in the corn stalks is useful for resisting disease, or having any survivors if an especially hot summer comes. &nbsp;If you scramble all the tiny spirals entirely and insert completely new information, what you get is not much higher levels of useful Chaos, you get a plant that entirely fails to form. &nbsp;The wildest, most diverse crop that still manages to live at all must be almost entirely regular and using almost completely standard forms of everything for its species; otherwise it comes out, not weird and warped, but simply a dead seed that fails to germinate at all. &nbsp;When you're adding a new and different mind to your team, full of wild ideas, they should hopefully be speaking mostly grammatical sentences that make sense, and not uttering random words and random sounds and twitching around wildly on the floor. &nbsp;The full absence of Law is not diversity, but randomness, noise. &nbsp;In many cases, nearly all the random ways of doing things get you pretty much the same effect, there is not much difference in contribution between a person wildly twitching on the floor in one way versus a different way, they look much the same from outside. &nbsp;Even diversity has to be almost entirely made out of shared order, and climb high up on the scale of optimality away from the level of noise, in order to be effectively diverse."</p>
              <p>"Even Chaos is made almost entirely out of Law. &nbsp;I thought it was something of a sententious old proverb, that was emphasizing one particular viewpoint on an underlying truth that seemed overly trivial. &nbsp;I wanted to think thoughts that nobody had ever thought before, sure, well of course I didn't want to do that by thinking random words, obviously. &nbsp;I wanted to start companies or invest in companies that nobody else would have thought of, that no other investor would invest in, I wanted to show that the way I thought differently was better and worthy of further exploration. &nbsp;Of course, if I wanted to pull that off successfully, it would be a matter of art and skill, governed by laws, with relevant history to study and relevant investigations to do. &nbsp;I thought that sort of thing didn't belong to Law alone. &nbsp;Chaotic people like me could say it too, so there wasn't anything especially Lawful about it."</p>
              <p>"Even Chaos is made almost entirely out of Law, in a fashion governed by higher orders, mathematics, whose name in Baseline also tends to translate into Taldane as 'Law'.&nbsp; I have gotten to this place, Golarion, I have heard what many of your 'countries' are doing.&nbsp; It is pretty clear that even the factions called Lawful seem to be confused about many things.&nbsp; And I am resigned at this point to the fact that at some point I am <em>also</em> going to have to go and somehow straighten out all the <em>Chaotic</em> parts because it seems pretty likely at this point that all y'all are <em>also doing that part all wrong.</em>"</p>
              <p>"In conclusion.&nbsp; The value of diversity in your heritage, and its nature as a kind of resource that strong optimization uses up - especially variation that has the nature of useful variations rather than destructively random variations - is another reason why, if you meet a human visitor from another plane with 18 Intelligence, it's a great time to make an exception to any usual social rules about not just subsidizing the very best men to have 144 kids apiece, because the diversity of your heritage will actually go up when you add in some kids from a smart alien, and some of your kids may think a little differently and be more useful to add to projects.&nbsp; This concludes my sales pitch; I have added in many of the caveats that I knew about, but I may have been biased in my thinking about them nonetheless; I have tried to give you the knowledge you'd need to do your own thinking about it independently."</p>
              <p>"Any questions?"</p>
