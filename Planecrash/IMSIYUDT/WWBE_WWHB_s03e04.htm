            <div class="post-content"><p>Keltham wakes up more muzzily than the previous day, to dawn's light coming through his windows.&nbsp; The non-fully-opaqueable windows seem less like a design flaw if clerics have to pray for their spells during the dawn hour.</p>
              <p>All right.&nbsp; Let's do this.</p>
              <p>Keltham reviews his notes from the previous night, written appropriately cryptically, and then prays, trying to cast his mind Beyond, maybe in the direction that wasn't the three space or one time, looking toward his deity: the Lawful Neutral god of people wanting to follow the protocols they must follow in order for their interactions to be mutually beneficial, come to the Pareto frontier, coordinate without vast enforcement costs, summing to powerful societies and markets even when people largely pursue their own individual interests individually, because they never step on others in order to do that.</p>
              <p>Requests, obviously subject to amendation should his unknown god deem there to be better spells he could get:</p>
              <p>0th:&nbsp; Detect Magic, Guidance<br>1st:&nbsp; Comprehend Languages, Truthspell, keep Sanctuary<br>2nd:&nbsp; Owl's Wisdom, Early Judgment<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3rd:&nbsp; Invisibility Purge</span> actually, how about his god only reassigns him Invisibility Purge, or Glimpse of Beyond, if Keltham <em>still</em> might need it<br>3rd:&nbsp; Owl's Wisdom, actually Honest Pricing also seems good here<br>4th:&nbsp; Early Judgment</p>
              <p>And&nbsp;<em>also:</em></p>
              <p>If conditional spell assignment works at all for communication with his god, please assign Read Weather (1st).<br>If the communication doesn't cost much, please assign Lighten Object (1st).<br>If the communication seems like it should be error-free and reliable, please assign Air Bubble (1st).<br>If Keltham should speak freely and teach as much as he can to his hosts, please assign Light (0th).<br>If Keltham should instead stall them with relatively less dangerous material, please assign Create Water (0th).<br>And if Keltham should run the ass out of here today with just Carissa and tell nobody else where he's going, please assign Lay of the Land (2nd).</p>
              <p>Any remaining slots should be assigned as his god sees fit.</p>
              <p>...Keltham would also like to talk, if now is a better time than yesterday, for whatever reason.&nbsp; Keltham has many questions about how he can best cooperate in a mutually beneficial way with his god.</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>It is TRUE that Pharasma has now had time to review Otolmens's first report about the anomaly.</p>
              <p>However, Pharasma has NOT had time to review the second, third, fourth, or most recently FIFTH additional reports that Otolmens THEN had to file dealing with the ABSURD and INCREASINGLY RAPID escalation of DIVINE INTERVENTIONS around the region She SPECIFICALLY SAID everyone needed to STOP intervening in.&nbsp; Abadar may be familiar with the THIRD report in this sequence.&nbsp; It concerns the mortal's acquisition of SEVEN CLERIC LEVELS.&nbsp; Yet ANOTHER report concerns an intervention by ASMODEUS who Otolmens is aware is GOOD FRIENDS with ABADAR.&nbsp; Then there are interferences by NETHYS and for some reason CAYDEN CAILEAN and Otolmens is still wondering what IOMEDAE was doing in that pseudohypothetical chat.</p>
              <p>Otolmens is willing to entertain that there are possible replies to a prayer which would make further events LESS COMPLICATED, such as commanding the anomalous mortal to REMAIN STILL AND NOT MOVE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.&nbsp; Is Abadar planning to send a reply like that?</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>It seems to Abadar that Otolmens might reasonably consider Asmodeus's conduct in Hell a threat to the stability of the Material Plane, if concealing it is necessary to prevent threats to the stability of the Material Plane and Asmodeus has never before been bothered to conceal this. It seems to Abadar that the mortal wants a nice rich stable world, and is more likely to endanger it if he ends up getting the wrong subset of information about the world, like might happen if you are Asmodeus and maliciously lying to advance your own interests. It seems to Abadar that containing the mortal by trying to learn his dangerous secrets while concealing Asmodeus's own dangerous secrets is an obviously doomed plan and it's absurd for Otolmens to countenance that and not countenance Abadar telling the mortal a small set of true non-inflammatory things such as 'Cheliax is lying to you' and 'my country has preexisting contractual arrangements for similar situations and will respect your intellectual property'.</p>

              <p>Well, Nethys is proud to announce that Nethys DOES have a plan!&nbsp; Definitely!&nbsp; A plan that encompasses even Abadar's own predictable reactions to how things are going so far!&nbsp; Nethys isn't going to tell you anything about the objective of that plan, though.&nbsp; Then you would get bored and stop looking, and Nethys finds it useful to overhear your conversations.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>What are Sevar's&nbsp;<em>actual</em> heresies?&nbsp; Maillol can't easily count them.</p>
              <p>Most centrally, Sevar believes that Asmodeanism is about making everyone ultimately better off, which is <em>the</em> central example of propaganda that gets fed to the Outers and that the Inners know better than to believe.&nbsp; Lots of Outers know better on some level, they just know that they'll die if they say it out loud or even if their thoughts are too honest about it, producing a kind of pseudo-belief that shreds apart words from wordless knowledge; an inner disintegrity that is then useful for many further ends in molding people, and probably aesthetically pleasing to Asmodeus as well, though it's hard to be sure with gods.</p>
              <p>Maillol does not think the time has come to drop that particular enlightenment on Sevar.&nbsp; She has had too little taste of privilege and power, she is too close emotionally to Lawful Neutrality and too exposed to Keltham's contrary examples.</p>
              <p>Sevar thinks that Cheliax's tyranny is painful in part because the pain is educational and necessary and ultimately beneficial to the people being punished.&nbsp; She thinks Hell is painful in part because that pain is necessary to produce the useful and refined beings that Asmodeus desires as tools.</p>
              <p>Maillol is not sure when, if ever, she'll be ready to hear that the cruelty is the point.&nbsp; You get told that either after you've sold your soul, or after Asmodeus has chosen you as a cleric.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Maillol doesn't think he should just refuse to answer either.</p>
              <p>"Sexually, you seem to have acquired the idea that it would be right for Keltham to do as he wished with you, once you gave yourself to him.&nbsp; On conventional Asmodeanism, one would say that it is right for Keltham to do as he wishes with you because he has the power to get away with it within a lawful system that offers you no defense.&nbsp; Keltham could come by that power because the Church told you to be obedient, because Asmodeus and his greater slaves like myself gave you to him to do with as he pleases, or because some girl was born into slavery to her slave parents and Keltham bought her and decided to enjoy strangling her in bed."</p>
              <p>"Don't misunderstand this as critique of the strategy you ended up executing, Sevar.&nbsp; Telling him that it was okay because you consented was an excellent move.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wouldn't have gone for it otherwise and he's just starting out with his first tentative steps away from his Lawful Good society."</p>
              <p>"But the fact that you <em>believe </em>what you told Keltham seems to have more to do with certain bizarre personal hangups of yours about events in countries that aren't even Cheliax.&nbsp; Right now, Sevar, the number one person most likely to drag <em>you</em> off to a bedroom and do as they will with you, is the Queen of Cheliax, who is not, to the best of my knowledge, male, and has no doubt killed <em>any</em> number of men after making good use of them.&nbsp; Whether any of them consented is&nbsp;<em>utterly</em> irrelevant to her soul's standing with Asmodeus.&nbsp; She's the Queen of Cheliax.&nbsp; There's no recourse from her, no appeal, no court, she doesn't just have the <em>power</em> to do what she wants with you, she has the <em>legal right,</em> which is the difference between Evil and Lawful Evil.&nbsp; Then for her to take what she wants from you, if she happens to want it, is the most natural and Asmodean thing in the world."</p>
              <p>"That you think it's more Asmodean from the&nbsp;<em>Queen's</em> perspective, if you happen to have consented, if you happen to have given yourself to her, is the heretical part.&nbsp; Maybe it's more Asmodean for&nbsp;<em>you</em> if you become a willing slave to the one who hurts you, a shadow of how it will be in Hell.&nbsp; It is <em>not</em> more Asmodean for the Queen to think that it becomes more right if she has your consent.&nbsp; That will not be what Asmodeus is thinking when you come to Him in Hell."</p>
              <p>"The obvious endgame on seducing Keltham would be to lure him deeper into sadism and domination with this talk about consent, and then lure him further to the point where he feels that he has the right to make use of somebody who hasn't consented to him at all, and does that.&nbsp; That will be the point that he starts to detect as Lawful Evil and be bound for our Lord's Hell."</p>
              <p>"And Sevar.&nbsp; This is not a male-versus-female thing.&nbsp; Asmodeus really, really doesn't give two shits about that.&nbsp; You've met our Queen.&nbsp; You should already know better."</p>

              <p>"If you're looking for somewhere to open the Queen's gift, Sevar, try the torture chamber on the right; there's no torturer currently on duty there and the junior priest stationed outside has healing spells.&nbsp; Though doing that right away may come at the expense of being able to prepare spells before you're scheduled to brief the other girls in the morning, depending on how elaborate the Queen's gift turns out to be."</p>
              <p>"It's also been suggested to me that you, Sevar, had to buy your own intelligence headband because requisitions was being weirdly obstructionist about it and gave you a two-week delivery time.&nbsp; The one you purchased will, on this version, arrive with the next delivery we get, later today.&nbsp; You say that where the girls and Keltham can hear.&nbsp; Then somebody, possibly Ione, should mention to Keltham the wild but unlikely theory that the delay is because they're planning to prepare cursed intelligence headbands, which exist just like cursed versions of most other magic items exist, and in particular have been famously known to do subtle influences and mind control and even make people dumber on certain subjects without realizing it.&nbsp; It's not impossible that they had at least one cursed headband lying around to substitute for the one you bought, to slip it to you immediately.&nbsp; The point being that Keltham shouldn't just ask to borrow your headband from you, though that's in any case something that wizards tend to be really fucking insane about."</p>

              </a>

            <div class='post-content'><p>She's felt it before, of course, she has Fox's Cunning and uses it sometimes when she's stuck on a spell structure, or on how to get an enchantment to lay nicely. It's wonderful, it feels like the difference between being groggily half-awake and being properly awake except on top of awakeness. It feels like the sort of conversation you have with another person where each of you sees exactly where the other is going so you get three words into a sentence and the other person says eagerly 'yes' and you can move on to the next piece, having placed a conceptual pointer, except with just one person.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Right now it's mostly just making it harder to refocus her attention away from the Queen's threat to petrify her. Which is silly. The threat made sense: Carissa is glad to live in a country where Queens issue such threats, because contemplating their overthrow really is a very grave crime and if there were no penalty more serious than more quickly meeting Asmodeus then more people would do it, and that wouldn't do. Carissa understood this incentive problem to mostly be solved with a very, very protracted death but she can appreciate why the Queen would have assessed Carissa's own incentives as being different. And very simple.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And she's not going to overthrow the Queen, because she isn't an idiot, so it's fine. Except that it seems like there are actually a lot of ways that Carissa could fail, from here, in ways that made people very angry at her, and -</p>
              <p>- it's always been true that she'll go to Hell&nbsp;<em>no matter what.</em></p>
              <p>- digression, why does Maillol think that the Queen might want to have sex with her? Why would the Queen want that? Should Carissa want the Queen to want that? She leans no, because being around the Queen more feels like it makes it more likely one ends up a statue underground. Maybe if she has succeeded tremendously at her project and built dath ilan but evil and better. If that happens probably she will not end up a statue underground.</p>
              <p>(The Queen could be bluffing. Asmodeus has chosen Carissa, perhaps He wouldn't tolerate that. There was no hint of it in her voice or manner but then, there wouldn't be.)</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Okay, setting that aside with more mental effort than it ought to take but not more than she has on hand.</p>
              <p>The Queen implied that Asmodeus instructed Cheliax to let Keltham go, when he leaves. Which makes sense of why Contessa Lrilatha was willing to concede that in contract negotiations; it was commanded already. Why did Asmodeus give those instructions? The Queen's right, that Keltham isn't a relative advantage for Cheliax at all if no one can learn his teachings without ending up a heretic. That seems really important to understand. She's not coming up with anything but it's standing out now in her memory as a question, along with 'why isn't Abadar talking to Keltham' and 'is Otolmens right to think Keltham might end the world' <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and 'how badly do I have to screw up to get turned into a statue</span>' -</p>
              <p>Queen's present before she gives the Taldor briefing, or after? &nbsp;....Carissa kind of wants to be in a lot of pain right now, so that settles that.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"Thank you," she says perfunctorily to Maillol, and goes off to the torture chamber.</p>

              <p>Carissa has been in torture chambers before, on both sides of the restraints.&nbsp; This one is much smaller than the one you'd find in a larger temple, with stations for only two prisoners and one torturer; and it's fancier and better-decorated with glaring crimson mood lighting, because it's in the temple built into the private summer villa of an archduke.&nbsp; But aside from that, it looks like a very ordinary and conventional torture chamber in an Asmodean temple.</p>
              <p>The bag is quite small, even for a Holding bag.&nbsp; You could fit your hand into how large it appears to be, if you tried, though the Queen did say it triggered just on being opened, and not with sticking your hand in.</p>

Down that path lies statues, which is a different kind of thought than 'down that path lies horrible pain'. Down her own path lies horrible pain. She knows that. She should expect many days in Hell that are like that, even if she's a very promising student, because there are things you can only learn that way. She...genuinely doesn't think it's the fact that that was the most AWFUL FIVE MINUTES OF HER LIFE - or however long it was - is the reason she's not asking to do it again.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Taldor has been around for nearly a thousand years, and has a civil war with brutal regularity at nearly every succession, because the next Emperor is appointed, technically by the Senate, a vestigial body in the capital with no real influence except once every few decades when it is called upon to name the next Emperor. The processes the Senate is supposed to follow are stunningly opaque and complex -- the word in Carissa's language for 'excessively complicated' stems from the capital city of Taldor -- and there's no mechanism by which the Senate's rulings are enforced, besides that they lend the named person a lot of credibility. Needless to say, that doesn't really work, and peaceful successions are at this point practically the exception; unfit or young Emperors have a tendency to be elevated only to swiftly die of it, ruthless outsiders sometimes have a go until they misstep in the capital politics they don't understand and die, the army is always cheerfully threatening to proclaim a general as emperor....</p>
              <p>Emperors tried in various ways to secure a preferred successor -- naming a co-emperor, say -- but it was common for junior co-emperors to be killed when their senior co-emperor died or lost his foothold.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Taldor is mostly feudal, but the Emperor appoints the rulers of some provinces directly, and those military governors are supposed to be especially loyal to him and his enforcers, if a fight is necessary. Of course, if you let your military governors accumulate too much power in their own right they might overthrow you. Of course, if you keep the people who concern you most close to home they might assassinate you.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Despite all this Taldor has remained a major global power, mostly for two reasons: firstly, even its outlying fortresses are a thousand years old and nearly unassailable (including by one another, during civil wars), and secondly, Oppara itself is a magnificently walled and warded city, and it's said those walls will outlast the world. It's lost some ground to Qadira, and some to Galt, but it's still larger than Cheliax.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>"All right. First, on settling sadism bets, the answer is yes. Also do not propose a bet with Keltham because dath ilan has a deeply bizarre norm that the thing you bet during sex is nonreciprocal services, which would otherwise, naturally, not be a thing because anything anyone does they should get something in return for. Yes, he thinks that still applies here where he has knowledge any government would slaughter cities for. Yes, I think it's plausibly worth trying to convince him that Evil has more fun, but you've got to be careful about it. I'll give much more specific instruction to anyone who seems to be getting close to him but the essential bits are - you want to be here, it's ridiculous that anyone would threaten or coerce you into being here if you didn't want to be, you might be exceedingly transactional about your intentions towards Keltham but it's your transaction that you expect to enrich you. You can, if you'd like, have one mean boyfriend who didn't treat you like that in your backstory, especially if you've got hangups to explain, but coordinate with me so you don't all do it. I do not want people who are inexperienced with pain in bed, or sexually inexperienced generally, trying to let Keltham hit you; we're working with a narrative where some people really like that, and most pain here or in Hell is because some people really like that, and if you've obviously managed to talk yourself into it that has decent odds of coming out.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>You are going to not lie to him about anything that's not essential. I get transcripts, I will light you on fire, you will be grateful I did because otherwise my boss would have to do it and he has a longer attention span for it. The key thing here is that Keltham notices different features of the world than us so we don't, actually, know all that much about how to lie convincingly to him. So the less you force us to fit into the lie, the easier our lives are. Say 'I don't feel ready to talk about it', say 'I should have learned that in class but it was the week my sister died so I wasn't paying attention', say 'I'm having a hard time putting it into words', say 'can I recommend you a book? I forget all the details myself'. You all want to show off by being competent, but we will get more out of Keltham if we are weak, flawed, confused, and therefore wouldn't be expected to have good answers to all of his questions. He already thinks everyone in this world doesn't know how to think. If you can't think of a<em> true</em> thing to say, or an <em>approved in-story&nbsp;</em>thing to say,&nbsp;the thing to do is to let him believe that even harder.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"We're going to delay it as long as we can because outmaneuvering smarter Keltham's going to be even harder, maybe impossible. Officially, Acquisitions said it'll be two weeks and I went ahead and ordered one myself, which I can afford to do and you can't because I've been earning a generous salary from Cheliax for my work at the Worldwound for six years and you haven't. The gossip is that this is because, you know, some intelligence headbands are cursed, and even worse some are just a tiny bit cursed, make you see things in a particular light, and optimistically Acquisitions is making really sure the project headbands are good and pessimistically, well, they could be manufacturing them a little cursed. Please attempt to have a little bit of subtlety in causing this gossip to reach Keltham's ears. I actually suspect that only the 'optimistically' part needs to be said and he is competent to fill in the rest.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Also we are going to be hiding a lot behind you guys not actually being all that well-educated, not actually knowing that much history or politics or economics, because magical education in Cheliax is very specialized. The smarter you are the harder it is for you to make innocent mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Keltham is under the impression you were screened for willingness to bear his children; I think that's just true, but if it's not, you now explicitly have permission to lie about it. Keltham is under the impression you are getting generously paid; I think&nbsp;<em>that's&nbsp;</em>just true, because I have told everyone that we're doing as few lies as possible, but if it's not, you have permission to truthfully say 'I was told we would be generously paid and if the money isn't there I'm going to go to whoever's in charge here and make a nuisance of myself' and then to come to me, and maybe to lie after that depending what's up. Keltham is under the impression that if you didn't want to sleep with him, no one would make you; you have permission to lie to him about that, but also, if you find yourself getting cold feet in bed, you won't actually be punished for telling Keltham 'wait, I think actually I'm not ready and I just want to cuddle', because that presently advances our goals. That said, if Keltham<em> ignores</em> you about that, that would be great news for the project and you should make sure he has a really pleasant time about it and ends up with the impression he was right to ignore you. I strongly expect that if you try to tease him by getting him really turned on and then saying 'no' he'll just give you a hug and say it's okay, so if you are trying this route you're going to have to try something a lot subtler and cleverer than that, and you should run it by me.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We aren't telling him about the soul arrangements, but if he somehow learns of it, the line is that it's normal for people in dangerous lines of work to arrange their afterlife in advance so they don't end up in Avernus in general processing, and that as a bonus these business arrangements are hotly competed for among devils so a good negotiator can get some reasonably powerful magic out of making their afterlife arrangements. But that's only if he somehow finds out. I, and some of your colleagues, don't have arcane sight, because our contractual arrangements were a bit different; we're still working out the best story for that so for today you should conceal having it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Other things you are explicitly expected to lie to Keltham about: who his god is. It's going to be an obscure Tian one. Whether all fourth-circle clerics have a weaker personal aura should they differ from their god in alignment; it doesn't come up much in Cheliax because it can't happen with an Asmodean cleric but you'd expect they wouldn't. Whether Cheliax is systematically concealing things. Whether Hell involves involuntary torture.</p>
              <p>And, of course, everything to do with the character of Cheliax as a nation. We're going to be pretending that Cheliax is Taldor."<br><br>And she explains her reasoning, again, and explains the key outlines from the fake timeline and from the books about Taldor.&nbsp;<br><br>"At this time I'll take questions, but my plan is actually for you to spend the rest of the morning learning enough about Taldor that you can be a magic-tracked shut-in who plausibly lived there."</p>

But I do think he'll notice if we're running the plot of a romance novel on him, it's too - you wouldn't expect to run across those people&nbsp;<em>in that order</em> unless something was up. And unless you're very good at faking sexual reactions he'll notice what you're actually into, dath ilan does train that skill. Also Keltham has in common with paladins that<em> in real life </em>the biggest barrier to seducing them is them endlessly going 'I don't want to risk you having a child I couldn't take proper responsibility for'. I think there's no point trying to convince Keltham that that's Good, I get the sense dath ilan has lots of children-related taboos which we should mostly just try to steer very far clear of. -relatedly, you're not allowed to point out to him that he could use magic to make you have an abortion.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>That said if anyone <em>does</em>&nbsp;have a convenient fetish for being forced that seems valuable. And once he's had some time to adjust we might be able to work with having threesomes where one girl forces the other and if Keltham objects both of them are like 'we're having a great time here????'."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>The researcher's best guess is that it's the Lawful Neutral deity Yaezhing, worshipped in a small coastal country in distant Tian Xia. He has copied from other texts some pictures of Yaezhing's symbols, and they're not a perfect match for the illusion that appears on peoples' foreheads when Keltham casts his fairness spells but they're not far off, and it's noted that these are from adventure memories by Avistani adventurers who passed through the country, so the likeliest explanation for the mismatch is poor recollection. One of the adventure memoirs claims confidently that Yaezhing is Lawful Evil but that memoir has a number of errors.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;For completeness he's also included some other symbols that are approximately as good a match, with notes on why the relevant deities were disqualified - this symbol is a good match but the god is a nature god who usually takes the form of volcanos and doesn't pick clerics. This symbol is an acceptable match but the god is a Chaotic Evil demon lord of the Abyss, best known for the time he led a bloody campaign to wipe out all the descendants of Azlant. This symbol is associated with an ancient Azlant god thought to be dead. And then gods without symbols but which otherwise seem like good matches:&nbsp;<em>Kofusachi </em>is attested to have truth-telling and trading spells, which is incredibly promising, but he's Chaotic Good - his domain is something like abundance and the state of resources where they are so plentiful one needn't be bothered to charge for them. Possibly he's hoping Keltham will bring that state to Golarion? No symbols similar to Keltham's are attested but a page of further information on him has been included all the same. Abadar is a Lawful Neutral god of commerce but his symbols are extremely well known, they're these, and his first and second-circle spells offered to his clerics are also well known, they're spells for ship navigation and preventing goods from rotting. Just in case he stopped by a church of Abadar in Westcrown to ask if Abadar has a lesser known aspect or associations with this symbol, but they didn't recognize either the symbol or the spell.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>With that established here's all that is known about Yaezhing. It's not very much. One of the memoirs has only a single passage, copied in full into the report; it claims that the people of this small coastal country live in great prosperity despite their lack of fertile land, for their god grants them freely knowledge of truth, and so they all trust each other and trade fairly, and mock the peoples of larger cities who by necessity trust no one and must stand watch at night against thieves. One of the others gives Yaezhing's divine realm, Setsendu, in Axis, and a domain of his as Justice; the third is the one that claims Yaezhing is Evil, and that Setsendu is in Hell, but agrees that Justice is a domain of his, as are Cooperation and Trust. Idols of him are drawn with bulging eyes, a long face, and a red beard, but that's indicative of practically nothing, especially with the gods that aren't ascended humans. There are vanishingly few books on him in Avistan; the author says he's reached out unsuccessfully to other libraries, and there's probably mentions buried in some of their books but it'll take a long time to find them.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And the page on Kofusachi, just in case it's actually Him somehow: Chaotic Good god of prosperity and abundance, mentions (meticulously copied, not very detailed) of trading and truth-telling spells, primarily worshipped in Tianjing, called The Laughing God, holy symbol is reportedly a 'string of seven coins'.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham reads through it all slowly; there's a lot of unfamiliar terms here, and he is more than usually on the lookout for things that don't make sense. &nbsp;That Golarion itself, does not make much sense, is the central problem there; but still, Keltham is looking, and noticing the many small confusions.</p>
              <p>Kofusachi:&nbsp; Has the trading and truth spells.&nbsp; Doing coordination correctly could look Chaotic to the locals if there's a norm, a single uniform way of doing things, that isn't correct coordination.&nbsp; The god of coordination could look like Good, if, say, good general levels of social coordination are a public-good, and public-goods are what everyone unselfishly wants everyone else to have?&nbsp; The god of coordination could be mistaken for a god of prosperity and abundance, if people didn't understand <em>what</em> was producing the prosperity and abundance.</p>
              <p>Yaezhing:&nbsp; If there's gaslighting going on, then Yaezhing is obviously the god they want him to believe in.&nbsp; Yaezhing hasn't had much&nbsp;<em>impact</em> on his people, for being the god of coordination; but then, coordination isn't quite the same concept as industry, and no god anywhere has granted Golarion real technology and science.</p>
              <p>...he knows too little of gods to know which parts are confusing because they're fiction, and which parts are truth that confuses the alien with the wrong priors.</p>
              <p>Keltham will keep this document, obviously, and later check it against other archival-type writings to see if a noticeable difference of style between other archived writings, and these supposedly variously sourced writings, suggests a LARP writing team having frantically produced them overnight.<br><br></p>
              <p>Also the words 'Good', 'Evil', 'Lawful', and 'Chaotic' are repeated often enough for Keltham to notice that the person who granted him Share Language (Taldane) last night probably had a slightly different concept of those terms than Carissa?&nbsp; 'Good' seems innocent, naive, an object of a kind of contempt that has little currency in dath ilan; Carissa‚Äôs ‚ÄòGood‚Äô sounded more like dangerous fanatics out to optimize you even if you tell them not to. &nbsp;'Evil' feels like it has undertones of power and sadism in a way that seems reminiscent of some things Carissa said in the cuddleroom, but in a sort of creepy icky gloating status-laden way; 'Lawful' has undertones a lot like 'Evil'; 'Chaotic' sounds like dangerous insanity and wild predators.&nbsp; The connotations are subtle and hard to describe; the connotations already hammered into Keltham's brain yesterday are competing with them.&nbsp; He already knows&nbsp;<em>those</em> words of Taldane, or his brain thinks it does.</p>

We believe there are many gods who never pick clerics. Gods are sort of only a human category anyway, for 'entities that can cleric us'; Pharasma and, say, Yaezhing, are going to be very different entities. It's said that there are things next to which Pharasma is small, and we are preserved because they're not paying attention, but no one has any proof beyond visions they had."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Generally, a geographically bounded god's interventions happen within a specific region, and most of their attention is allocated there. To pick a geographically bounded god we know more about, Mazludeh is the goddess of sacrifice and stewardship - Neutral Good. She's active in Holomog, a country south of here. She tends to have about twelve clerics at a time, most of them selected when they first visit one of her temples in Holomog; on some occasions she's chosen someone elsewhere, but always someone who had been near her clerics when they travelled - suggesting that Her attention was following their cleric. I've written to the Worldwound to ask if Yaezhing's priests are there right now, as that's the likeliest mechanism; our representative there didn't know offhand, but they probably are. Even small Lawful countries usually send a couple of representatives to the Worldwound on general principle. Or Yaezhing might not be a geographically bounded god at all! Our references are too limited to be sure."</p>

Nethys is also technically said to be an ascended human god but His ascension process was different and drove Him mad, reportedly. And then there are scattered other ex-mortals: Irori, Lawful Neutral, who ascended through attaining perfection; Erecura, a Lawful Neutral god of secrets and soothsayers and the Queen of Dis, in Hell; Milani, Chaotic Good goddess of bloody revolutions."</p>

              <p>If anyone has an established answer to that they need to tell Meritxell immediately. "My contract's just for the week, I'm going to have to renegotiate it afterwards," she says. No one has told her. Aaaaargh. "It's for 300gold, which is...I think around four unskilled-labor-years?" And if she gets in trouble for that it can just be less on an ongoing basis. It being a lot less than that would be weird if Keltham knows anything about what wizards go for generally.</p>

              <p>"I'll go," says Meritxell cheerfully. "I was born here in Ostenso; my father's a wizard and my mother is a cleric of Asmodeus. She picked him out because she wanted smart children. I have eight half-siblings.&nbsp;My elementary school was in the temple so I didn't actually leave it until I was ...ten? It was a big temple, though, endless courtyards and secret passages and so on, and it had an orphanage, so I had lots of peers, though I was smarter than them. I had more toys than them so I traded them toys for doing all my chores. When I was nine I tested into wizard school and was absurdly excited mostly because it was all the way down the big street. When I was twelve my mother decided all this was embarrassingly uncosmopolitan and so she took me on a trip around the country by boat and that is how I discovered I get very seasick, and declared I wasn't leaving Ostenso again until I'm a high-level wizard and can Teleport. A declaration that was about to be falsified, since I've enlisted, but now here I am instead of going to the Worldwound so maybe it'll come true, who knows."</p>

"When I was seven the village got a priest and the priest said everyone had to come into the temple for school, so I went, and I hadn't seen reading or writing before but I picked them up right away, and after a couple of months I was studying with the older kids, and after a year he said I should go into the city where I could get a proper education, and the church would house me and feed me while I did, so the next time he reported back to a big city he took me with him, and I came here, and did a bunch of tests and then got put in wizard classes."</p>

              <p>"Governance then should now have a specific, rather than abstract or secondhand, notion of what I know and what that knowledge can do.&nbsp; It's built on a base level of trained skills of thinking, that work together effectively because of overlapping coherence and direction inspired by explicit mathematical structure, which were applied by my Civilization of a billion wealthier people of much higher average Intelligence to systematically decode and exploit reality to a far greater distance than Golarion appears to have traversed, leaving also incomplete traces in my personal memory of specific facts, techniques, and methodologies that I encountered in systematic or unsystematic passing."</p>
              <p>"I know why snowflakes have sixfold symmetry.&nbsp; I can turn mechanical motion into cold without a Snowball spell, but I don't know yet how much motion for how much cold.&nbsp; I knew how to build a faster kind of unpowered sailing ship but it sounded like you have those already.&nbsp; I know how to make an unpowered mechanical device that will let people move between cities faster than a person can run, but only if there are roads between those cities.&nbsp; I know how I'd go about figuring out how to make cheaper roads, but I don't know how long that research will take or how good the end results would be.&nbsp; The books in the library here are written in ways that reflect patterns of thinking that I know are invalid, and I remember some things about how to train a person as intelligent as I am so that they'll think effectively.&nbsp; I know the foundational math that structured the kinds of thinking that I learned.&nbsp; There is an attractor, an overlap, a center in everything, whose structure is that math, and by far the most important question is whether Golarion can be started down the path leading into that attractor and learn for itself what Civilization learned, but there remains the question of what Governance wants to see first for scaling up investment in this."</p>

For any given solution, there are often going to be a lot of Golarion-specific reasons why it's not easy to implement, and our current prediction is that little - not none - of dath Ilan's direct technologies will easily translate. But if we understand the basics of how the gods reason, and how human-level intelligences can use the reasoning patterns of the gods, then we can overcome any given complication that is due to dragons or Charybdis or the fae or whatever."</p>

              <p>"I would find a partial list useful, of things Governance has previously spent money on, how much money for what results, in a way that struck upper Governance as being just barely good ideas, but good ideas nonetheless.&nbsp; Where the 'just barely' qualifier tells me that the outcome was worth <em>around that much</em> money and not&nbsp;<em>at least that much</em> money."</p>
              <p>"I would also suggest that Governance at some point take the time to reflect on its own operations and figure out&nbsp;<em>how much it relatively wants different things...</em>"&nbsp; Keltham reflects on the techniques he got taught as a kid for carefully extracting that info, checking if it made sense, checking if anything got left out, "where standard techniques for doing that correctly and not screwing it up, are, again, something I can try to teach.&nbsp; It's really not just about better forging techniques.&nbsp; Civilization also knew how to, for example, manage very large projects effectively... assuming all the managers are slightly smarter than I am, so, yes, it may require adaptation, but still."</p>
              <p>"But I've got no idea how much something like that is worth to you, or what kind of increased project resources I could get after accomplishing that, versus inventing a more visibly successful forge process that uses 30% less fuel," and neither, apparently, does Governance itself have any collective idea what it's worth to Governance.&nbsp; "I realize I may sound like I'm flailing here, but right now I'm very much trying to orient at all, to what Management wants from me and how much it's willing to pay to get it."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham nods; that's grim-but-true.&nbsp; If plagues reduce population density to make future plagues less likely, or if people starve until their immune systems weaken and after a plague the survivors get more food per capita, those are both equilibria that will get restored around the variation of particular causes.&nbsp; "I'll think more toward generalizable measures that will shift long-term equilibria of epidemic levels, rather than on specifics of one epidemic, then; if your impression is that naively eliminating one particular source of epidemic would say cause urban density or food per person to increase or decrease until the remaining epidemics became more virulent."</p>
              <p>"I'll obviously also want a contract before solving particular things, and it'd be nice if there was some generalizing way to assess that value, rather than my constantly interrupting myself to negotiate and sign new contracts.&nbsp; That's part of why it would have been useful to have a schedule of how much value the government assigns to things; we could then negotiate general percentages covering what I and other project members would capture of the value we create."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Cheliax expects to request most of the gains, maybe 80% or 90%, of Keltham's inventions while he is repaying them for the loan of this villa and a full-time research staff and a full-time security staff; the loan will accumulate interest at the same rates any devil in Hell gets if they get a loan in Hell, usually humans have to pay <em>higher </em>interest rates than that but that's because, frankly, lots of humans will run away and not pay, and they both trust and can verify Keltham's assurances on that front. Cheliax expects to request much less of the gains, perhaps half, once the loans are repaid. A complication they are keeping in mind is that, uh, Cheliax doesn't have a systematic way of collecting benefits that don't literally directly accrue to the state in the form of higher tax revenues from various dukes, and it sounds like Keltham's society would have such a method.&nbsp;</p>
