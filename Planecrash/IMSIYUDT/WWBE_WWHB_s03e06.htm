That's great, because Carissa has decided the entire harem needs to read a bunch of Taldane romance novels so that if they can't stop themselves from thinking in romance novels they'll at least be whatever kind the King in <em>Taldor</em> has commissioned to develop appropriate attributes in Taldane young women.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>.... it turns out romance novels in Taldor are not commissioned by an Imperial office at all, which is itself the kind of useful thing you only learn by pretending to be Taldor.</p>

"<em>You</em> grew up after Hell took Cheliax to straighten us out and<em> you </em>got to read normal modern romance novels in which girls <em>win</em> the boy. Though none of the ones in which the girl wins the boy by cleverly getting all her romantic rivals' eyes gouged out, or in which the girl wins the boy by leaving him under the impression she's an important noble considering executing him unless he wins her over, and not <em>The Damnation of Sir Nicholau.&nbsp;</em>...actually I don't know what romance tropes the slightly gentler Cheliax we're going for has. ...maybe there's a version of The Damnation of Sir Nicholau where she's trying to teach him to enjoy himself, instead of having perfunctory sex he doesn't really like, and he goes to Hell once he realizes that he wants things for himself instead of only wanting whatever's best for other people, and in every disguise she's happy and fine because she, unlike him, has been raised competent to understand what she wants and to go get it."</p>

              <p>"Which, again, was basically the plotline of <em>Perverting Adan -</em>"</p>
              <p>"It's the plotline of <em>any</em> young adult novel with a female protagonist, who will, at some point, have to learn the darkness of her own desires," Ione snaps at Paxti.&nbsp; "As you'd know if you read more than one book a year -"</p>
              <p>"We can work with this, though," Paxti says.&nbsp; "Give me and Ione twenty minutes, and we'll come up with new plots for everyone's favorite romance books, with storylines that fit the new Cheliax."</p>
              <p>"I'll slit her throat before we get two minutes in," says Ione.&nbsp; Ione also sees a much bigger problem with that idea, but she's curious whether Sevar will spot it on her own.</p>

              <p>"Actually, if I can get an authorized lie on this, none of us much like reading fiction at all," Ione says.&nbsp; "Cheliax has been devoting too many resources to the Worldwound, and the books written before Hell took over are trash.&nbsp; If we talk about any fiction we've read, in front of Keltham, he's going to ask to see it.&nbsp; Remixing fiction isn't like redoing a spellbook with <em>Glimpse of Truth</em> renamed to&nbsp;<em>Glimpse of Beyond.</em>&nbsp; Maybe we can rush some better books from Absalom, and read one apiece before Keltham gets around to asking about that, so that we can have <em>ever</em> read a novel.&nbsp; But if he asks before then, you tried reading novels from old Cheliax and quickly gave up."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>They're not going to have all that much time for it.&nbsp; Keltham may not be very trained to handle potential lies and gaslighting, but he was planning to be a Mad Investor, and hails from a vastly more financially sophisticated Civilization.&nbsp; He's not going to negotiate and compromise with Marta, and then sit down in front of an actual authorized negotiator who takes their final compromise as Keltham's starting point and negotiates a new set of moves in Cheliax's favor.</p>
              <p>This wouldn't usually happen in dath ilan - firstly because dath ilan would just seat both real negotiators directly, and second because the principles behind bargaining positions are better understood, such that they'd try to have bargaining outcomes be invariant to the order in which considerations are introduced.&nbsp; But dath ilan does have the concept of hiding an unusually high willingness-to-pay so that sellers can't price-discriminate against you, and sending in a 'negotiator' who doesn't actually have the power to make commitments is a standard known-failure-mode-to-avoid.</p>
              <p>Keltham will, of course say all this to Marta directly; none of that meta-information has any obvious rationale for keeping it secret.</p>
              <p>After that, he'll ask Marta more detailed questions about terms and conditions on Cheliax's starting offer, and more questions about the current size of Cheliax's economy, and what kind of measurement difficulties they expect to run into, and Governance's likely willingness-to-pay for various goods.&nbsp; But he won't <em>negotiate;</em> except insofar as offering his own starting remark that the offered percentages of generated value seem acceptable, if there's no gotchas in how profits or expenses are measured, and sufficient for quick agreement from there; but he wants to understand the terms and conditions before he says for sure that the starting offer is generous.</p>
              <p>At some point, Keltham thinks, he needs to give Cheliax a lecture on fairly dividing gains from trade <em>anyways.</em>&nbsp; If he can run through it quickly, he might as well do it today and see if that saves some time on negotiating.&nbsp; If they know that dath ilani approach fairness in a very structured way, maybe he can just tap himself with his own Truthspell and the Fair Division of Gains from Trade spell, say what the fair price would be, and have them accept that.</p>
              <p>Keltham wraps up with Marta - having hardly exhausted his unending sequence of Additional Questions, of course, but that's just what life is like for your first few weeks in another dimension - and heads over to the library.</p>

              <p>"Never mind.&nbsp; For a start, today, I'm going to try to quickly review the way that dath ilani learn about negotiation -"</p>
              <p>"Or actually no, before that, there's a test I realized yesterday I should run.&nbsp; Before things go much... further." &nbsp;Keltham is a little worried about where exactly he is inside reality, right now.&nbsp; It's probably just a silly worry.&nbsp; But yesterday with Carissa, he thought of an obvious possible way to check on it quickly, if everyone here is honest. &nbsp;It might not work, but then, it might.<br><br></p>
              <p>Keltham grabs a couple of the improvised markers from yesterday, and goes to the section of wall that was being used as an improvised whiteboard (with erasure via Prestidigitation).</p>
              <p>Keltham first shows how to use Unanchored Scales, an experimental elicitation tool for when you just want somebody's intuitive strength of feeling about something, without them worrying exactly about what any numbers mean.&nbsp; Draw a line with two endpoints representing 'not at all' and 'all the way', and then you draw a slash through the line at the point that corresponds to your intuitive strength of feeling.&nbsp; You could use it to ask 'How warm is this room?' without people bugging you about how warm a '3' was supposed to represent.&nbsp; It's not perfect, obviously, but the point is that the elicitation method acknowledges that imperfection up front.</p>
              <p>Keltham then asks everybody in the classroom, including Carissa, to answer two questions, separately, anonymously, on bits of paper to fold up and mix before he looks at them.&nbsp; Obviously, they shouldn't consult with each other at all before answering.&nbsp; Obviously, Keltham promises to make no effort to figure out who wrote down what.&nbsp; He really does want them to write down an honest answer, though, if they write down anything at all; they can draw an X-cross on the paper if they want to openly refuse to answer.</p>
              <p><br>The two questions Keltham writes on the whiteboard are:</p>
              <p>"How much do you have an unusual interestingly-complicated backstory or current problem, that I'd find out about if I got into a relationship with you?"</p>
              <p>"What do you expect will be the average answer of everyone here to the previous question?"</p>

              <p>Well, 'Keltham' would be the paying player of the original LARP, so...&nbsp; "I think what we're looking for is the expected degree to which I, a dath ilani, would say something like, 'Wait what?' after I found out.&nbsp; So the fact that you spent years at the Worldwound would be, like, a third of the way across, because it's surprising to me and matters to me, while you being secretly a dragon shapechanged into a human, if you knew I'd find that out later in the relationship, would be more like two-thirds across.&nbsp; Maybe let's say it's only past the halfway point if you'd expect <em>other</em> people here to be surprised."</p>

              <p>Meritxell would like to be a shapedchanged dragon! Or have a fascinating tragic backstory or something! Those feel like the way to be the best at this and she'd like to be the best at this. She's pretty sure if she'd had, like, a month's warning she could have had the best sexual fetishes, too, but that's hard to do from a cold start. She reluctantly marks down that she's not very interesting, which is incredibly painful to do, and that the average person is probably slightly more interesting than that, which is agonizing.</p>

              <p>Hopefully they'll get a good distribution of claims of interestingness so that any given girl can pretend later to have assigned a different one than she in fact did, but they can't coordinate, and it's hard to guess what other people will say.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>"Trading at all, at any price in the range, is mutually beneficial; we're both better off.&nbsp; But on top of that event, there's another event, a question of the exact price, in which my being one gold piece better off makes the other person one gold piece worse off."</p>
              <p>"How do we set that price, then?&nbsp; Aren't we locked into an adversarial game where it's my interest to say, 'I'll only sell at ten million minus one', and it's their interest to say, 'I'll only buy at one million plus one'?&nbsp; Why would we say anything else, when saying anything else just makes the other person better off at our own expense?&nbsp; But if we both think like that, the trade doesn't occur at all."</p>
              <p>"What price is fair?&nbsp; Or to put it another way, how can two people like that agree on a trade at all?&nbsp; How does Golarion, how does Cheliax, think about that?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>It hasn't come up in their books about Taldor yet but Carissa's met Taldane adventurers and in fact tried to trade them things and the answer is the same there as in Cheliax. "You barter. You say 'why, I don't see why I should give up this shirt for a coin less than twenty million gold, which communicates 'I'm open to negotiating a trade but would need to be persuaded it's the best trade I can get', and the other person says 'twenty million! I have a hard time believing even such a sentimental item is worth more to you than an entire week of Nefreti Clepati's time during which she could make a dozen duplicates of the shirt and make you a personal demiplane besides, and that would only be <em>eight&nbsp;</em>million gold. And really it seems to me like this trade is worth your time even for one duplicate of the shirt and the personal demiplane, and that would be only eight hundred thousand gold, which is what I'm offering. Which communicates 'I'm open to negotiating a trade but would need to be persuaded it's the best trade <em>I&nbsp;</em>can get'.</p>
              <p>And you say 'my, imagine what Nefreti Clepati would say if you tried to lowball her prices like that! I'm not sure this conversation is worth my time, if my shirt is worth so little to you.' Which communicates - and you might be bluffing, you're allowed to bluff when you're doing this - that the quoted price is well outside the range that's worth it to you, and they'd better indicate that they think there's overlap between their willingness to pay and your willingness to sell.</p>
              <p>And you iterate on this and then end up settling somewhere, the exact place depending on how competent at bartering you are and on the range of trades you both like."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Consider - as a dath ilani might consider it - the problem of a dath ilani cast into a strange new universe, who must trade with the aliens found there.</p>
              <p>(It is in fact quite a common trope, in dath ilani science fiction.&nbsp; But it wouldn't particularly occur to Keltham to classify this situation as that trope. &nbsp;Cheliax is <em>way </em>too legible. &nbsp;They have a currency of 'gold pieces' that they cheerfully translated for him into unskilled-labor-years. &nbsp;Golarion would need to be a <em>lot </em>weirder before it was good Trade With Aliens science fiction.)</p>
              <p>The aliens, one may suppose, have a biological-evolutionary setup similar enough to dath ilan's that they have epidemics, caused by viruses and bacteria and parasites.&nbsp; Suppose the aliens don't know about viruses and bacteria and parasites; or vaccines or antibiotics or filtering masks or possibly even sterilization.&nbsp; Nor about how one should use experiments to determine whether a disease is airborne or waterborne or touch-transmitted or transmitted through wastewater contamination or is carried by smaller or larger animals.</p>
              <p>The dath ilani, then, knows something which this alien Civilization might find of great value.&nbsp; The alien Civilization can perhaps pay for this knowledge, with some alien means of payment.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the alien Civilization, being nonhuman (or just non-dath-ilani) tries to be stingy about it; to lowball the dath ilani; to buy their knowledge at a cost of, say, a pile of shiny metal, or title to one island in the ocean.&nbsp; Depending on the exact backstory of how the aliens came to try this, and whether it was in some sense the fault of that whole civilization or just a part of it, even a non-Keltham dath ilani might well say, "Screw you, pay me."</p>
              <p>That, too, the dath ilani are taught; in Golarion terms, the difference between Lawful Good and Lawful Stupid.</p>
              <p>But then how high does the price need to be, exactly, for the dath ilani to agree to the trade?&nbsp; By what system do you determine an answer to that?</p>

              <p>In turn, the notion of 'fair trade' relies on understanding the notion of trade in the first place.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>'Jellychips', a staple of dath ilani lessons to young children, are small lumps of edible flavored gel.&nbsp; Jellychips come in distinct appearances, colors, shapes, and flavors; almost always, everything with exactly the same appearance has exactly the same flavor.&nbsp; Ten jellychips might mass as much as one peanut; they're meant to implement a burst of tasty flavor that's just enough to be present and pleasant.&nbsp; They're tiny so that children don't get end up getting all of their calories from economics lessons.</p>
              <p>To teach the notion of trade, you begin by passing out jellychips to children, and let them experiment a bit to find out which of their favorite flavors have which external appearance.&nbsp; Then ask the children to write down which flavors they like more or less than others.&nbsp; Compare the lists; observe to the children that they tend to like different flavors more or best.&nbsp; (There is in fact a jellychip selection algorithm, based on previously observed food preferences among the kids, which makes sure that this happens.)&nbsp; Observe to them that, by trading jellychips with each other, they could all end up with more of the kind of jellychips they want.</p>
              <p>Let them trade, a bit, as they desire.&nbsp; So long as they <em>haven't</em> been introduced to any formal concepts of 'fairness' to complain about, this part usually does not go too poorly, among dath ilani children.&nbsp; They'll find jellychips that they have, and don't want; and look for somebody else who wants those, and has some they want; and trade 1-for-1.&nbsp; If you let them play longer they'll start to notice triangular trades that no two children can complete, and do those too, but still usually 1-for-1.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>When the first rush of trading has died down, introduce to the children the concept of a multi-agent optimal arrangement: an arrangement such that it's not possible to redistribute the jellychips in any way that leaves all of the children better off simultaneously.&nbsp; Ask them if they think their current arrangement got there.</p>
              <p>Now the kids have a concept of a <em>social</em> goal to aim for, a way in which they can be&nbsp;<em>collectively</em> winning at trade or performing subpar; and the arguments will become a bit more heated.</p>
              <p>(Especially if you've sorted all the kids to have a certain sort of personality, and usually therefore all be boys; because sometimes different children learn different things, and some of those things are best learned by similar children all together.)</p>
              <p>It usually doesn't take long for one boy to start telling another that they <em>need</em> to make a trade, in order to get the classroom* into what they've figured as the optimal arrangement.</p>
              <p>Of course the older kids immediately step in at this point, and remind everyone that, by the definition of multi-agent-optimality, you should never need to <em>force</em> somebody to trade in order to get to a jellychip arrangement that's <em>better for everyone;</em> the target state should be better for the person who's making the trade too.</p>
              <p><br>(*) &nbsp;Not actually a 'room' in the sense of being indoors; children need to be exposed to outdoor light levels in childhood in order to not grow up nearsighted. &nbsp;The surface area required for children to spend enough of their day outdoors is currently the limiting factor on the urban density of the Great City (called also Central City and Default). &nbsp;This is one of the places where public will and private incentives are in conflict, since there's a pressure towards ever-greater urban density in the center; but if this were permitted, soon it would be mostly childless people who could afford to live in Civilization's dense center.&nbsp; For that and other reasons, it's been decided that it's better to limit the Great City's density and keep Civilization more spread out. &nbsp;To find a solid expanse of skyscrapers, you'd need to visit a major city with few or no children per capita, like Big Quiet, or Erotown.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>After this enlightenment, an adult Watcher comes forth, and argues to the younger children that the whole point of trading things is that different people put different values on the same goods: if you-1 like black jellychips and have blue jellychips, and you-2 have black jellychips and like blue jellychips, then you can both do better by trading jellychips with each other.</p>
              <p>This, the Watcher argues&nbsp;solemnly, is the point of trade, and the whole reason why people trade with each other: because they get different enjoyments from owning the same things, so that they can both become better off by passing the same fixed goods back and forth between themselves.</p>
              <p>The younger children are asked if they first-order believe that.</p>
              <p>None will say 'yes', at that point.&nbsp; The most overeager ones will say 'No!' but then be unable to explain why not.&nbsp; Most kids will give the brief Baseline comeback that colloquially translates to 'I probably would have believed it, if I wasn't pretty sure you were trolling me, though I haven't seen anything that I suspect is the real argument against it'.</p>
              <p>(A dath ilani childhood tends to make one grow up suspicious of things that grownups say with great solemnity.&nbsp; Civilization considers this a desirable outcome, which is good, because it sure is the outcome they're getting.)</p>
              <p>Regardless of their answers, the children are then <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6KzFwcDy7hsCkzJKY/the-point-of-trade">asked whether people who all got the same enjoyments from the same goods would never trade with each other</a>.&nbsp; And so that pathway of learning continues.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>On a separate track through the lattice of knowledge, a new idea may now be introduced on those foundations, the notion of a <em>fair trade</em> between black jellychips and blue jellychips.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It begins by showing the children a way to rearrange their understanding of jellychip preferences, as a quantitative relation and not just an ordering, through the concept of <em>indifferences</em>, which state equalities of preference.&nbsp; Not just, "I like purple jellychips more than black jellychips, and black jellychips more than blue jellychips" but "I am <em>indifferent</em> between having 5 purple jellychips, or 6 black jellychips, or 8 blue jellychips."</p>
              <p>But then, of course, you might be able to execute multi-agent-beneficial trades that&nbsp;<em>aren't 1-to-1.</em>&nbsp; If someone is indifferent between having 6 black jellychips and 8 blue jellychips, then trading <em>7</em> blue jellychips for 6 black jellychips will leave them better off than before.&nbsp; Right?</p>
              <p>A lot of children will say 'No!' at this point, and try to find some reason why that couldn't possibly be valid, because they know how economics lessons work, by this point in their lives.&nbsp; They expect that somebody's about to lead them down a pathway that takes them down to 6 black jellychips and then 5 purple jellychips and so on until they only have one jellychip left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>But you can, with a bit more work, convince them that it's totally valid to&nbsp;<em>want</em> 6 black jellychips more than 7 blue jellychips, and valid to trade things according to your wants, and tell them that in fact this does <em>not </em>necessarily always expose them to a set of clever trades that take them down to 1 jellychip which, it will then be proven to them, they must want to trade for nothing.&nbsp; That's not actually going to happen!&nbsp; You're thinking it's going to be the point of the economics lesson, but it's not!&nbsp; Adults actually trade 7 hours of labor for 6 fancy shirts all the time, without ending up with 0 shirts, and this is isomorphic.</p>
              <p>The children are then asked if they think they can get to a more multi-agent-optimal state by trading&nbsp;<em>uneven numbers of jellychips</em> amongst themselves.</p>
              <p>The children approach this warily; or with a burst of initial enthusiasm that fades, after many children prove rather suspicious of attempts to get them to trade more jellychips for less jellychips.</p>
              <p>Dath ilan having an average Intelligence of 16 or 17, it doesn't take long for somebody to point out that, even if one person likes some jellychips more than others, that's no reason for them to end up with <em>less jellychips.</em>&nbsp; Other kids also like some jellychips more than others.&nbsp; Why shouldn't&nbsp;<em>they</em> be the one to end up with less jellychips, and I, be the one who ends up with more, if that's how we're going to play it?</p>
              <p>Why yes, Keltham <em>was </em>the first one to say it in those terms, in his own class, when he was very young.</p>

              <p>Then for Keltham to trade his 12 blue jellychips, for 10 black jellychips from Limyar, would leave them both better off.</p>

              <p>If you're the sort who agrees to just&nbsp;<em>any</em> trade that's mutually beneficial - like Limyar, in this classroom, had been earlier arguing people ought to do - then you know what Keltham is going to do to you?</p>
              <p>That's right.&nbsp; Keltham is going to offer 9 blue jellychips for your 12 black jellychips, you're going to accept, Keltham is going to carry out the trade, and then Keltham is going to angrily throw another 3 blue jellychips at you and yell that you're being stupid.</p>

              <p>If the alien civilization offers some tiny lowball offer - like, say, a supply of food and water - in exchange for every last scrap of your knowledge, and there's no other civilization around to trade with, you and they will both be better off if you accept, compared to if you don't.</p>
              <p>But if you accept offers like that one, food and water is the most you can expect to be offered, if the aliens are less Lawful Neutral than Keltham.</p>
              <p>(Even if there's two alien factions around to trade with, you can't quite rely on them bidding against each other.&nbsp; What if they coordinate with each other instead?&nbsp; There's a noticeable amount for both of them to gain, if they both agree to offer you only food and water, instead of a higher price.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Another game is now introduced to the children, played with a single flavor of jellychip.&nbsp; It is not, in dath ilan, called the 'Ultimatum Game', but the actual name they have for it is the 'Final Trade Offer Game', which isn't all that different.</p>
              <p>One child gets a dial, with settings from 0 to 12.&nbsp; Another child gets a button.&nbsp; The first child picks a setting on the dial and locks it in.&nbsp; The second child then chooses whether to press the button.&nbsp; If the second child presses the button, the first child gets as many jellychips as the dial indicates; the second child gets jellychips equal to 12 minus the number on the dial.&nbsp; If the second child doesn't press the button, they both get nothing.</p>
              <p>Which is to say: the first child proposes a division of a gain of 12 jellychips, where they get some part, and the other child gets the rest.&nbsp; The second child can approve the division, or refuse it; and if they refuse, both get nothing.</p>
              <p>If you run this lesson on dath ilani children, virtually everyone offers a 6:6 jellychip split and everyone accepts it.</p>
              <p>At least, that's what they do on round zero, the initial round where they try things the simple way to verify their starting assumptions.&nbsp; Then they start experimenting.&nbsp; It's not so much that they're being selfish, and trying to figure out what they can get away with; it's that they're figuring there must be <em>some</em> clever point to this game, and you're not going to find it if you just offer 6:6 every time.</p>
              <p>Some kids try out accepting splits of 7:5.&nbsp; Other kids are like, ok then, and offer them 7:5 splits, which usually get rejected if, like, people are going to make a <em>thing</em> out of that, right.&nbsp; Some try offering compacts to trade 7:5 splits for 5:7 splits, but there's no guarantee that any two kids will be matched up again in the future.</p>
              <p>At this point the older kids step in and say that the point of the game is drifting away from the reality it's intended to model, and everybody nods and waits for the next part.&nbsp; (Of course there's a next part.&nbsp; There's been a weird game and no stunning insight about it has been presented yet.&nbsp; They've ever been to a lesson before.&nbsp; Older people aren't going to make you execute a weird pointless procedure and then <em>not</em> have some stunning insight to offer you as payment; kids would stop going to lessons, if that bargain was often violated.)</p>
              <p>Before the next part, though, the older child teaching asks what the kids think is probably the <em>ideal</em> or&nbsp;<em>correct</em> thing you're supposed to do if somebody offers you a 7:5 split, not as a game, but in real life.</p>
              <p>Keltham, of course, said to reject the offer.&nbsp; Some other kids agreed the offer should be rejected.&nbsp; Some claimed that you should accept it, but everyone should be angry at the person and whoever went next with them should offer them 7:5.&nbsp; Limyar claimed that you should always accept it, even if the other person offers 11:1, because <em>everyone </em>would end up with fewer jellychips if you rejected than if you accepted, so rejecting the offer couldn't be multi-agent-optimal.&nbsp; Keltham asked Limyar if he actually believed that.&nbsp; Limyar said no but he was going to go on saying it anyways to annoy Keltham.</p>
              <p>The kids argue about it for a while, and then the demonstration moves on.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>The next stage involves a complicated dynamic-puzzle with two stations, that requires two players working simultaneously to solve.&nbsp; After it's been solved, one player locks in a number on a 0-12 dial, the other player may press a button, and the puzzle station spits out jellychips thus divided.</p>
              <p>The gotcha is, the 2-player puzzle-game isn't always of equal difficulty for both players.&nbsp; Sometimes, one of them needs to work a lot harder than the other.</p>
              <p>Now things start to heat up.&nbsp; There's an obvious notion that if one player worked harder than the other, they should get more jellychips.&nbsp; But how much more?&nbsp; Can you quantify how hard the players are working, and split the jellychips in proportion to that?&nbsp; The game obviously seems to be pointing in the direction of quantifying how hard the players are working, relative to each other, but there's no obvious way to do that.</p>
              <p>Somebody proposes that each player say, on a scale of 0 to 12, how hard they felt like they worked, and then the jellychips should be divided in whatever ratio is nearest to that ratio.</p>
              <p>The solution relies on people being honest.&nbsp; This is, perhaps, less of a looming unsolvable problem for dath ilani children than for adults in Golarion.</p>
              <p>Once this solution is produced and tried once, the older children congratulate the kids on having solved the first layer.&nbsp; On to the second layer!</p>
              <p>In the second layer, some children get handed sealed cards before each game, telling them whether to be honest about it, or to try to grab a little more for themselves.&nbsp; (Though remember, say the older children, that this is all only a game; we are trying to ask how Civilization can be robust to bad people, not teach you to be bad people yourselves; the thing is, you see, that on scales much larger than this class, there really <em>will</em> be some bad people.)</p>
              <p>And that means the child who sets the dial, or the child who presses the button, can't trust the other to be honest.&nbsp; Even if the other child's sealed card didn't say to be dishonest, the first child has no way of knowing that.</p>
              <p>(Dishonest people really do complicate things, don't they?&nbsp; Just the fact that they exist makes things harder on everyone else, because they don't know who the dishonest people are.&nbsp; But that's part of the difficulty of constructing an adult Civilization, one that has to scale to numbers beyond two dozen or sixteen gross.)</p>

              <p>Keltham plays through with as much cold and steely determination as a seven-year-old can muster, offering exactly what he thinks is fair, rejecting anything he thinks is less than fair; feeling awful when the other kid yells at him that he <em>was</em> being honest, but not swerving from his course.&nbsp; He can trust himself; he cannot trust the other.&nbsp; When his card tells him to be dishonest, Keltham gives ridiculously huge estimates for his own labor, and hopes the other child is wise enough to know that Keltham is, must be, lying.&nbsp; Sometimes he's told to be dishonest and he has to pick the split himself, and then he gives a huge estimate and pretends he believed the other kid's huge estimate.&nbsp; Sometimes the other kid doesn't catch on in time, and then Keltham has to offer an unfair split or tap out of the game and metagame entirely, which feels like failing even more.&nbsp; Sometimes the unfair split gets rejected, and sometimes it gets accepted, which is worse.&nbsp; Keltham sets aside all his unearned chips to redistribute after the lesson ends.&nbsp; It's a good thing this is only a game, because living life like this would be awful.</p>
              <p>Lessons end for the day.&nbsp; It is sometimes good to let children dwell for a time on problems that don't have known solutions yet, or realize how awful life can become when not everyone has deduced the governing Law.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>When the children return the next day, the older children tell them the correct solution to the original Ultimatum Game.</p>
              <p>It goes like this:</p>
              <p>When somebody offers you a 7:5 split, instead of the 6:6 split that would be fair, you should accept their offer with slightly less than 6/7 probability.&nbsp; Their expected value from offering you 7:5, in this case, is 7 * slightly less than 6/7, or slightly less than 6.&nbsp; This ensures they can't do any better by offering you an unfair split; but neither do you try to destroy all their expected value in retaliation.&nbsp; It could be an honest mistake, especially if the real situation is any more complicated than the original Ultimatum Game.</p>
              <p>If they offer you 8:4, accept with probability slightly-more-less than 6/8, so they do even worse in their own expectation by offering you 8:4 than 7:5.</p>
              <p>It's not about retaliating harder, the harder they hit you with an unfair price - that point gets hammered in pretty hard to the kids, a Watcher steps in to repeat it.&nbsp; This setup isn't about retaliation, it's about what both sides have to do, to turn the problem of dividing the gains, into a matter of <em>fairness;</em> to create the incentive setup whereby both sides don't expect to do any better by distorting their own estimate of what is 'fair'.</p>
              <p>They play the 2-station video games again.&nbsp; There's less anger and shouting this time.&nbsp; Sometimes, somebody rolls a continuous-die and then rejects somebody's offer, but whoever gets rejected knows that they're not being&nbsp;<em>punished.</em>&nbsp; Everybody is just following the Algorithm.&nbsp; Your notion of fairness didn't match their notion of fairness, and they did what the Algorithm says to do in that case, but they know you didn't mean anything by it, because they know you know they're following the Algorithm, so they know you know you don't have any incentive to distort your own estimate of what's fair, so they know you weren't trying to get away with anything, and you know they know that, and you know they're not trying to punish you.&nbsp; You can already foresee the part where you're going to be asked to play this game for longer, until fewer offers get rejected, as people learn to converge on a shared idea of what is fair.</p>
              <p>Sometimes you offer the other kid an extra jellychip, when you're not sure yourself, to make sure they don't reject you.&nbsp; Sometimes they accept your offer and then toss a jellychip back to you, because they think you offered more than was fair.&nbsp; It's not how the game would be played between dath ilan and true aliens, but it's often how the game is played in real life.&nbsp; In dath ilan, that is.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>After that came the part where Keltham's learning-group was introduced to their first <em>sophisticated </em>trading-game, with tokens that produced varying quantities of jellychips, but only when held in proximity to other tokens, and large enough groups of tokens could produce more tokens.</p>
              <p>Despite their best efforts and the lesson they'd just learned - and, since they were still young boys, after a lot of shouting, beyond a certain point - the nascent market had soon shut down almost entirely over refused trades, caused by disagreements about what was 'fair'.</p>
              <p>During the game's post-mortem, it was eventually figured out (with some nudging and hinting from the supervising older-children) that children with rarer tokens had tended to think that the weight of a token's value for its even division ought to be determined by that token's scarcity; children with tokens that produced lots of jellychips (even if they required some other tokens to be nearby to work) tended to think that direct jellychip production was the obvious starting anchor for weighing economic value; children with tokens that produced other tokens argued themselves to have the only goods that mattered in the long run, and that you'd need a lot of lesser tokens to trade fairly for one of those.</p>
              <p>This begins the pathway of learning that leads to market prices, the other way of setting prices; in which larger Civilization has a collective interest in seller prices ending up close to the marginal cost of production, so that as many trades as possible occur.</p>
              <p>Children who master the complications here have officially passed Financial Literacy Layer 2, and can have their own investment accounts*, which was the main reason Keltham was going through this whole lesson-sequence at age seven instead of age eight.</p>
              <p><br>(*)&nbsp; Having an investment account in dath ilan is the equivalent of having a 'bank account' in other places, rather than a mark of greater financial maturity than that.&nbsp; Dath ilan doesn't particularly use, as a store of value, currency-denominated packaged bank debt with fixed returns. &nbsp;Value is stored mostly in equities.&nbsp; When you write a check against your investment account, divisible fractions of equity are automatically sold out of it in some medium of exchange, and automatically reinvested in the receiver's account, according to the (simple) autoselling and autobuying algorithms on both sides.&nbsp; If you want to pay for less volatility in your assets, you buy insurance on the equity, so that somebody agrees to buy the asset from you if it drops below 80% of its original-purchase price; and the price of insurance like that is a risk signal.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>When it comes to selling knowledge to aliens, to be clear, Financial Literacy Layer 2 is not going to get you there.&nbsp; If the answer across every plausible premise was trivial and similar, that trope wouldn't be such a staple of dath ilani economic fiction.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, Golarion is not nearly weird enough for Cheliax to be composed of aliens in the relevant sense; the Chelish have money and will tell you how many unskilled-labor-hours it corresponds to.&nbsp; The most you have to worry about is that somebody gave them a dishonesty card - which does mean you have to do your own calculations about what's fair, and not just ask them.</p>
              <p>When you are not dealing with&nbsp;<em>alien</em> aliens, when setting prices with those aliens is not <em>the point of the story,</em> a normal dath ilani would consider the solution obvious.&nbsp; There comes a saturation point beyond which individuals cannot realistically use any more money to become happier themselves, for usual reasons of just-noticeable-differences being a mostly-constant fraction of how much you already have, which implies utility roughly logarithmic in wealth.&nbsp; If the aliens offer to pay you that much, asking them to cough up more would mean that a number of poorer aliens would all have to give up chunks of utility that loom larger for them, so that you could get much smaller amounts of utility; and even if that's fair, it isn't Good.&nbsp; If the aliens offer an ultimatum for <em>less,</em> turn them down with very high probability; they're trying to give you far less than you're worth.&nbsp; Would Civilization offer less than a billion labor-hours to an alien bearing knowledge of how to eliminate whole swathes of diseases hitting large sections of the population?&nbsp; (No.)</p>
              <p>Of course, in a normal dath ilani economic-fiction isekai story, <em>the entire world you end up in is not insane in every part; </em>there may be&nbsp;<em>one</em> insane point of departure with some insane consequences lawfully extrapolated, but the author is not going to throw an <em>entire</em> insane world at you; it wouldn't be credible.</p>
              <p>A normal dath ilani, thrown into another world, does not come in expecting to need enough money to make lots and lots of important investments that the natives haven't made because the natives are insane.&nbsp; They're expecting to find an <em>alien</em> efficiency of no simple ways to make everyone collectively much wealthier, not the <em>howling absence</em>&nbsp;of that efficiency.</p>
              <p>Keltham wasn't expecting Golarion either.</p>
              <p>He did, however, catch on in short order to what he currently thinks is the magnitude of the problem.</p>
              <p>It is possible he will need a lot of money to solve it.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>If you've actually got to negotiate with very humanlike aliens, you need Financial Literacy Layer 5; or at least, Keltham hopes that's what he needs, because that's what he has.&nbsp; This gives him access to a spotlighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value">permutation-based method</a> for determining the fair contribution of one actor to a multiagent process.&nbsp; It's not spotlighted nearly as hard as, say, the Probability axioms, or Validity; but it's pretty much the only spotlighted method for that kind of fairness, and Civilization is somewhat hopeful that aliens will use it too.</p>
              <p>The permutation-based method says to consider how much marginal added value an agent produces, by being added to a collection of other agents, when considering every possible order in which to add all agents into the evaluation.&nbsp; If, for example, two people are both needed to complete a task worth 10 jellychips, and it can't be completed at all without both of them, then there's two possible permutations:</p>
              <p>Permutation 1:<br>&nbsp; Alis:&nbsp; Alis alone receives 0 jellychips; her marginal value, added to the empty set, is 0.<br>&nbsp; Alis+Bohob:&nbsp; After adding Bohob, the payoff is 10 jellychips; Bohob's marginal product, added to Alis is 10.<br><br>Permutation 2:<br>&nbsp; Bohob:&nbsp; 0 jellychips.<br>&nbsp; Bohob+Alis:&nbsp; 10 jellychips.</p>
              <p>Averaging the marginal products together across all permutations, the method says that Alis and Bohob both receive 5 jellychips.</p>
              <p>Yes, this is a very simple answer to be produced by all that logic, but the point is that it generalizes.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Applied directly to the situation with Cheliax, the method says, roughly, that Keltham should receive an amount proportional to how much marginal product he adds, on average, to all possible (ordered) subsets of Cheliax.&nbsp; If Cheliax had only half its current people, for example, Keltham might only add around half as much value.&nbsp; For even smaller subsets of Cheliax, product might fall superlinearly; Keltham couldn't necessarily accomplish 1/20,000,000th as much with a single Chelaxian.</p>
              <p>It adds up to 'somewhat less than half of his marginal product when added to all of Cheliax, probably'.&nbsp; Yes, this is a very simple answer to be produced by all that logic; but the point is that Keltham knows <em>why</em> that is&nbsp;<em>the fair</em> answer and what he ought to do if he gets offered less.</p>
              <p><br>Keltham doesn't spell out this part explicitly, or say that he was willing to accept Cheliax's opening offer taken at face value, and indeed would have compromised on substantially less had it been necessary.&nbsp; Cheliax mentioned difficulties in accurately measuring the gains to the country, and may intend to offer a measuring methodology expected to be an underestimate of the real value; or it could be that Cheliax is thinking the split is about direct profits from project sales, where Chelish consumers are capturing much more value than the sale price of the products, the consumer surplus.</p>
              <p>Also Keltham might find there's weird terms or conditions in there, in which case he wants to get the highest initial offer on hand so he can burn percentage points as bargaining power, to iron out the terms and conditions.&nbsp; He can always hand back any excessively generous jellychips that are still left at the end of that.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Sometime even later, Thellim is going to conclude that maybe it's&nbsp;<em>not</em> the moon.&nbsp; She will then wonder if there's <em>any way</em> to explain to Earth economists how the absolute basics of negotiation work in coherent decision systems (eg those consistent under reflection in the presence of correlated agents and/or models of agents).&nbsp; Or even, minimally, get them interested in what sort of 'irrational' behavior rational agents want to have 'reputations' for having, and if there's any <em>systematic structure</em> in there that might possibly be&nbsp;<em>interesting.</em></p>
              <p>It turns out that Earth economists are locked into powerful incentive structures of status and shame, which prevent them from discussing the economic work of anybody who doesn't get their paper into a journal.&nbsp; The journals are locked into very powerful incentive structures that prevent them from accepting papers unless they're written in a very weird Earth way that Thellim can't manage to imitate, and also, Thellim hasn't gotten tenure at a prestigious university which means they'll probably reject the paper anyways.&nbsp; Thellim asks if she can just <em>rent</em> temporary tenure and <em>buy</em> somebody else's work to write the paper, and gets approximately the same reaction as if she asked for roasted children recipes.</p>
              <p>The system expects knowledge to be contributed to it only by people who have undergone painful trials to prove themselves worthy.&nbsp; If you haven't proven yourself worthy in that way, the system doesn't want your knowledge even for free, because, if the system acknowledged your contribution, it cannot manage <em>not</em> to give you status, even if you offer to sign a form relinquishing it, and it would be bad and unfair for anyone to get that status without undergoing the pains and trials that others had to pay to get it.</p>
              <p>She went and talked about logical decision theory online before she'd realized the full depth of this problem, and now nobody else can benefit from writing it up, because it would be her idea and she would get the status for it and she's not allowed to have that status.&nbsp; Furthermore, nobody else would put in the huge effort to push forward the idea if she'll capture their pay in status.&nbsp; It does have to be a huge effort; the system is set up to provide resistance to ideas, and <em>dis</em>incentivize people who quietly agreed with those ideas from advocating them, until that resistance is overcome.&nbsp; This ensures that pushing any major idea takes a huge effort that the idea-owner has to put in themselves, so that nobody will be rewarded with status unless they have dedicated several years to pushing an idea through a required initial ordeal before anyone with existing status is allowed to help, thereby proving themselves admirable enough and dedicated enough to have as much status as would come from contributing a major idea.</p>
              <p>To suggest that the system should work in any different way is an obvious plot to steal status that is only deserved by virtuous people who work hard, play by the proper rules, and don't try to cheat by doing anything with less effort than it's supposed to take.</p>
              <p>Thellim could maybe solve this problem if she put around five years of her life into taking the knowledge, and putting it into a form where the system thinks it's allowed to ever look at it or talk about it without that being shameful.&nbsp; But Earth has problems that are plausibly more important than their entire field of economics being firmly convinced that a particular set of crazy behaviors are 'rational' and that healthy, prosocial, equilibrium-solvable behaviors are 'irrational'.</p>
              <p>She ends up writing a handful of blog posts about it, tossing mentions of it into a couple of stories she writes on the side, and otherwise leaving Earth to its fate there; Earth has rather a lot of awful fates going on simultaneously, and that one is not <em>literally </em><em>their most important problem</em>.<br><br></p>
              <p>This, however, is not her story.</p>

It - wouldn't even be hard, with magic, you wouldn't need coordinated distractions but <em>no one would do it,&nbsp;</em>even if you'd made a very bad mistake at school and were going to be disciplined -" they did check, Taldor beats students for misbehavior too. "You don't have to..... be so nice to children they wouldn't ever occasionally wish their school was on fire, you just have to teach them enough discipline that even when they wish it was they&nbsp;<em>don't do it."</em></p>

              <p>"I suspect there's some weird sticking point here that - look, sufficiently young kids <em>do</em> get slaps on the wrist.&nbsp; Civilization doesn't like it,&nbsp;<em>I</em> don't like it, but even dath ilan never figured out how to produce healthy adults while never doing that at any point.&nbsp; There are elements of morality and personhood that humans just weren't designed to learn without experiencing small amounts of pain in childhood.&nbsp; But every time you set up a situation where a kid gets told that they need to do something or else get slapped on the wrist, you also add some value to an investment account the kid gets access to when they're older, such that even if the kid <em>was</em> secretly an adult in a kid's body, they would still be calculating a net benefit on being present for the whole transaction.&nbsp; To make sure the <em>total&nbsp;</em>interaction is still&nbsp;<em>mutually beneficial,</em> which means,&nbsp;<em>beneficial to them too,</em> so that&nbsp;<em>ideal</em> kids wouldn't have an <em>ideal </em>incentive to escape their parents or destroy the whole system.&nbsp; Civilization goes on optimizing its heritage and the kids keep getting smarter and more Law-comprehending, which means that you always check all the interactions with children to make sure that the system wouldn't fall apart if the kids started being more ideal intelligences than expected one year.&nbsp; And having to pay that amount to set up a potential wrist-slap situation reminds adults to check, every time, whether they really needed a wrist-slap there."</p>
              <p>"I realize you can't afford any of that, but it&nbsp;<em>is</em> how Civilization thinks.&nbsp; We don't want to build into the system a load-bearing assumption that our kids are stupid and weak, even if they&nbsp;<em>are.</em>"</p>

              <p>The most obvious, thinks Meritxell, is that you don't actually want adults who believe themselves entitled to blow up any system that isn't serving them, because then you end up like Taldor having a civil war every few years.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The most obvious, thinks Tonia, is that kids can in fact run away and get eaten by wild beasts if they want, and none of them do, so they obviously think being around their parents is better than not that, which they're right about.&nbsp;</p>

It doesn't&nbsp;<em>matter,&nbsp;</em>it's all&nbsp;<em>nothing&nbsp;</em>next to the magnitude of the gift they've already been given, the only reason they're even able to parse it instead of rounding it off to the zero it is is because their minds are broken and they're very small and stupid. If a god were somehow born into a human child's body they wouldn't care if they got hit in class or not; human weakness isn't any particular nature of the bribes but the fact they're required at all, and planning for more perfect agents would mean planning for agents whose thoughts were too big and vast to give this question a second's contemplation.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham shall now observe to them that, if Meritxell has 12 green and prefers two blue to three green, and Gregoria has 12 blue and prefers two green to three blue, then all of the trades "5 green for 7 blue", "6 green for 6 blue", and "7 green for 5 blue", are&nbsp;<em>mutually beneficial,</em> but differently divide up&nbsp;<em>the gains from trade.</em></p>
              <p>There's a lot of different ways for jellychips to be arranged such that they can't be moved around without making at least one player worse off.&nbsp; For example, Meritxell could have all the chips, and nobody else could have any.&nbsp; Then any other way of arranging the chips will make Meritxell worse off!&nbsp; So that's one of the many possible global optima.</p>
              <p>Different paths through the mutually beneficial trades will take you to different global optima.&nbsp; So long as all the trades&nbsp;are mutually beneficial, you won't end up&nbsp;<em>worse off than if you never traded,</em> at the end; but you might end up much worse off than if you'd <em>traded more carefully.</em></p>
              <p>Keltham is a bit surprised that they didn't more quickly see the way in which this game resembled real life, since they seem pretty good at mathematical comprehension of the sort of structure that this game has in common with real life.&nbsp; But that will come with having more than one day's practice with parsing up games and real life into the pure abstract structures and simple mathematical properties they have in common - with parsing up real life as a shadow of Law, that is then recognized at once when incarnated in some much simpler game.</p>

              <p>"The market price of shoes should settle somewhere not too far from the costs of making leather and going to cobbler lessons, not settle at nearly the absolute maximum price that anybody around would pay to be allowed to ever wear shoes again.&nbsp; So people are <em>noticeably</em> better off because of shoemakers existing at all, rather than being <em>only a tiny bit better off</em> because the selling price of shoes is so astronomical that it cancels out almost but not quite all of the real benefit that people get from shoes."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham describes the sad situation which eventuates when you do hand out dishonesty cards to kids.&nbsp; They work hard, propose splits that they guess are fair, not being able to trust the other person, and then sometimes those splits get rejected.&nbsp; The kids get angry!&nbsp; There is shouting!&nbsp; They get sent home for the day without having a solution shown to them, because it's good for them to sometimes dwell with problems that don't get solved immediately.</p>
              <p>(He doesn't tell them about younger-Keltham's emotional difficulties with being asked to act out a dishonesty card; he has a sense that Chelaxians would have trouble relating, for some reason.&nbsp; Maybe they'd say that even at age seven you should be able to understand that the game isn't real and just do what the card says?)</p>
              <p>If Keltham has understood correctly, Cheliax considers the obvious game solution to be even splits of jellychips, irrespective of work difficulty; which is repeatedly randomly unfair, and hence asymptotically fair.&nbsp; Going into any one game, you are equally likely to get faced with a harder or an easier task for your fixed payment, and if you repeat that often enough, the expected unfairness as a fraction of all payments will drop as the square root of the number of repetitions.&nbsp; It's not actually too bad, as solutions go.</p>
              <p>Still, if Cheliax already has a better solution to the dath ilani game, or to the real-world situation that it stands for, Keltham stands ready to hear it?</p>

              <p>"The initial notion of a fair price has to come from somewhere - from the part of yourself that initially suggested 6:6 in the Ultimatum game, which reflects a bit of Law I'll describe later - but once you get that notion of fairness from somewhere, and put a system like this around it, no seller has an incentive to claim an unfairly high fair price, and no buyer has an incentive to claim an unfairly low fair price.&nbsp; And if they happen to honestly disagree about that anyways, in some ambiguous situation, they'll still complete the transaction with very high probability so long as they only disagree a little."</p>
              <p>"That, roughly, is how bargaining works in dath ilan over one-time trades:&nbsp; If somebody offers a price the other side thinks unreasonable, the other side says, 'That strikes us as an unfair division of gains, even if mutually beneficial as such; but if you made that your final offer, we'd generate a visible random number and accept with 10% probability'.&nbsp; And then the price-setting side can potentially offer further arguments about why the trade is more valuable than it looks, or make a better offer, or accept that low probability."</p>
              <p>"The bargaining process Carissa described earlier, for selling my shirt, sounded like - people were probably trying to sort of flail at that underlying structure, by acting like they might be very unlikely to take an offer, or be moderately likely to take an offer, as they got closer to an agreeable price?&nbsp; But with a lot more... weirdness, acting, in Baseline we'd say 'LARPing'.&nbsp; Maybe because they think they have to pretend a lowball offer isn't mutually beneficial at all, in order to justify rejecting it; and also with some incentives to be misleading, because the underlying signals aren't as precise and legible as saying '10%'... and there's an incentive to exaggerate, but then the other side knows you're probably exaggerating, so you exaggerate even more, and you get people saying these exaggerated statements that both sides know aren't true, but there's uncertainty about how <em>much</em> the speaking side thinks they're really exaggerated, and modulating that uncertainty ends up being the medium of communication?&nbsp; At least, that was my attempt to decode what Carissa described."</p>

              <p>No more anger and shouting!&nbsp; Yes, sometimes somebody says your offer isn't fair, and you say it is fair, and they generate a random number, and the random number says that neither of you get anything, and that is a little sad.</p>
              <p>But you know that they didn't claim that unfairness in order to try and profit at your expense; you know the incentives weren't like that, for them.</p>
              <p>And they know you didn't state your offer in order to try and profit at their expense; they know the incentives aren't like that, for you.</p>
              <p>You know they know you don't have the incentive to cheat, so you know that when they state a higher price than you think is fair, and end up rejecting your offer, they weren't trying to punish you for trying to cheat with a lower price.</p>
              <p>You can see how, if you kept on playing this game for a bit, pretty soon both sides would learn to converge on a similar concept of fairness, and fewer offers would get rejected.</p>

              <p>"The first answer is that outputs aren't always legible, and then you have to appropriately incentivize people's fairness on valuing the outputs.&nbsp; In the version of the training game that the kids got, how much&nbsp;<em>effort</em> they had to put in wasn't fully legible, but the&nbsp;<em>outcome</em> of the game being won was visible and unmistakeable.&nbsp; But suppose somebody is making a shoe; how good of a shoe is it exactly?&nbsp; Maybe you could pay a trained third-party shoe-evaluator to come in and say exactly what they thought it would be worth, but measuring your output objectively like that is <em>expensive</em>.&nbsp; What we have instead is the partially legible output of a shoe, where the quality of shoeparts or the evenness of the make or whatever it is that people value in Golarion shoes, might not be clear and objective to the point where the shoemaker and shoebuyer couldn't possibly disagree on it.&nbsp; So then they need to both reason in a way that incentivizes fairness from the other, without everything shattering with probability 1 in the presence of a small disagreement."</p>

              <p>"Imagine that room full of children if you told them that, any time somebody made them an unfair offer and tried to cheat them, they ought to hit back in a way that made sure the person lost even more value than they tried to steal, to teach them a lesson, no matter how much more that cost their own position in expected value.&nbsp; Those kids wouldn't grow up to be dath ilan's Civilization.&nbsp; Possibly they wouldn't grow up to be any civilization at all."</p>

She isn't sure, not yet, but - it really does feel like there's a way to lock an additional piece on, a way that you can get even cleaner and higher-performing results with fewer deals walked-away-from, less value left on the table. If you're not Good and unwilling to do anything that's punishment, if you think you have some duty to keep people in the game when in reality they were born into the game and the only way out of it is their utter destruction. The whole point of pain - possibly not the whole point of pain, but a lot of it - is that it's a deterrent that can be delivered without destroying any value at all. Dath ilan doesn't have one of those, so all the rules have to assume that there isn't one...</p>

              <p>"Yes indeed; sometimes you can take an ideal-agent calculation whose naked specification is too large for even gods to compute, and either simplify it to an exact answer, or get a good and fast approximation of it."</p>
              <p>Keltham whiteboards a sum over every possible permutation of 12 tokens, pausing to explain dath ilani math symbols like 'all permutations' and 'initial string up to first appearance of this symbol'.&nbsp; For every possible order in which the tokens could be arranged, consider the marginal production that token adds, on the step it's added.&nbsp; (0-10 produces 0, 11-12 produces 12.)&nbsp; Then, divide that sum by the number of permutations.</p>
              <p>"This sum has 479 million, 1 thousand, 6 hundred terms," Keltham says.&nbsp; "I've already finished adding them up.&nbsp; How are you doing on that?"</p>

              <p>In which case they couldn't have studied a lot of combinatorics?? &nbsp;Keltham would really have guessed that 'this bit of spell with 12 elements has 479,001,600 possible conformations' would be an important chunk of spellcraft, unless things only work at all when there's only 1 possible conformation.</p>
              <p>Maybe you don't get to that part at second circle.</p>
              <p>Or maybe - this is a weird thought, but Keltham is starting to feel suspicious of a trend - Cheliax teaches combinatorics in some incredibly narrow way where they've <em>only </em>learned combinatorics for spells and not <em>combinatorics for everyday life??</em></p>
              <p>This probably isn't the most important thing right now, file it with the other 'Why are they so inconsistently X??'</p>
              <p>"Correct, but I'm not sure everyone was following along with that, so let's try a smaller scale version.&nbsp; Suppose I took four of you, lined you up in a randomized order - you can imagine it being visibly randomized, if you like - and gave 8 jellychips to whoever was standing second in line.&nbsp; On average, how many jellychips should you expect to receive if I run this procedure on you?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Yeah, the thing I was trying to force you to do with the four students in twenty-four possible orders was sum over the 6 possible ways you could be standing second in line, to make the point about how the sum is&nbsp;<em>defined</em> as being over every permutation.&nbsp; In retrospect, clearly, I should've started with the case of tokens labeled 2, 3, and 5, but I'm sort of making this up as I go along because it's been a few years and I don't remember some of the exercises let alone their ordering.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; Anyways -"</p>
              <p>"When you're trying to see if there's a way to do what ideal agents would do - or gods, if you think gods are powerful enough to be ideal about that particular case - you want to distinguish the Law that <em>defines</em> what the solution&nbsp;<em>is,</em> and any clever ways you come up with to&nbsp;<em>compute</em> the Lawful solution faster."</p>
              <p>"When you've got 12 identical tokens, such that any group of 11 or 12 of them will produce 12 jellychips, there's a symmetry argument which says that each token must get one jellychip.&nbsp; If you thought there ought to be a&nbsp;<em>coherence constraint</em> on the Law of fairness saying that holders of identical tokens should end up with identical payouts, you could use that to compute the answer even if you had no idea what the actual Law was.&nbsp; Often when you&nbsp;<em>do</em> see how the Law works, you can go back over a lot of your intuitions, and say, 'Oh, yes, that intuition I had previously was shadowing this coherence of the Law, even though I didn't know how the whole Law worked' and that's a kind of sanity check on whether you're reasoning correctly at all."</p>
              <p>"But the Law of fairness that <em>defines </em>the target answer for the '11 tokens of 12' problem is <em>in principle</em> a sum over 479,001,600 marginal productions, of which all but 39,916,800 are zero, and 39,916,800 of which are 12, divided at the end by 479,001,600.&nbsp; Which means that we can say there's a <em>single&nbsp;</em>ideal fairness formula that governs both the '11 of 12' game, and the '2, 3, 5' game, even if <em>shortcuts</em> or&nbsp;<em>approximations</em> for the particular cases of the formula can be different, in cases where a shortcut exists."</p>

              <p><br>Carissa wanted to know whether Asmodia was being impressive on purpose because an Asmodia who is trying to get Keltham's attention, or an Asmodia who is trying to be hard for Cheliax to replace - an Asmodia who has started playing for her survival against the project's interests, more than everyone in Cheliax is doing all the time - is a different problem than an Asmodia who is doing her best but bitter because she had been consoling herself that Cheliax was lying about Good and they turned out not to be. She thinks a disillusioned angry-at-Good Asmodia is probably usable. She is open to learning from someone with more experience with this, though.</p>

              <p>Carissa tries to think what Maillol will think if she tells him that she wants to try to talk Asmodia around. It would be nice if she could predict what Maillol thought about things so she could stop bothering the real one so often, but he still surprises her as often as not, and she isn't sure if he'll think this is Carissa being inexperienced at having a real command and accordingly stupid, or Carissa having weirdly good instincts&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">because Asmodeus dropped Keltham near her for a reason</span>.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>...she should focus on the lesson or she's going to get behind. And then Keltham will think she's kind of stupid, which ....might be good, if it means he thinks she's not a ringleader, but would interfere with attachment to her, she's pretty sure. Lesson it is.</p>
