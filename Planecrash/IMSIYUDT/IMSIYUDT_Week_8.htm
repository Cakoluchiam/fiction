              <p>(Carissa asking him what's Chaotic for a dath ilani -)</p>
              <p>Not thinking that.</p>

              <p>(Every few hours he updates again about conditions in Golarion being even worse, though apparently 'all random local landing regions are as bad as the Worldwound' was successfully an overshoot of where that was heading -)</p>
              <p><em>Not thinking that either.&nbsp; His brain needs to rest.</em></p>
              <p>(He needs to figure out what people here use instead, if 'cuddleroom' doesn't translate to Taldane.&nbsp; And also is there any way to figure out whether his contraception is still active, or if he would've gotten rid of it by using healing energy on himself last night?&nbsp; Maybe he can find security and ask them who to ask.)</p>
              <p>Okay, both valid questions, but nonetheless, be <em>still</em>, his brain.&nbsp; This morning he got woken up by light in the windows, instead of waking up to his own rhythm, and it is more than plausible that his brain will now benefit from at least a brief nap.&nbsp; Learning wizard magic will probably go better with relatively less tired brains.</p>

              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Tell me," Elias says to her, "how you reconcile the teachings of our god with the teachings of dath ilan."</p>
              <p>Oh, wow, this conversation is going to suck. "Dath ilan is different from our world, and I think less of Keltham's lessons transfer than he realizes," she says blandly.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I forgot to mention," Elias says, "that I'm in a hurry, and that your ability to say things that don't mean anything isn't in question. What's&nbsp;<em>wrong?"</em></p>
              <p>"- he's got to be wrong about Law and Chaos because if that's all there was to it some church would explain it that way, and they don't. He's got to be wrong about, uh, I think dath ilan teaches things well for if you're going for the Starstone, but badly for if you're going to Hell, because you don't need a lot of initiative at making progress on unstructured questions and developing it before you're a devil seems like it involves a lot of indulging lazy human impulses -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Cleverly said. Is that a trade you want to make, becoming less useful to Hell after death to be more useful to Keltham?"</p>
              <p>"- I think it serves Asmodeus, for me to... indulge weak human impulses temporarily, if that's all I can do to try to understand dath ilan's technology. We'll make Cheliax stronger and more powerful and more useful to Him, and if I require more correction subsequently, so be it."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think you'll require different correction, at least. But there is opportunity to arrange it in advance."</p>
              <p>This is hardly even surprising so it's confusing that Carissa feels like she's falling, and like her fingertips are tingling. "Of course."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We've made arrangements with some devils for purchase contracts with the students here. Take your time to read it over, of course. We're going to invite most of the students to a signing ceremony tonight, but it sounds like you've made conflicting plans?"</p>
              <p>"Well, I don't know, can I bring a date?" asks Carissa sweetly. Elias slaps her, harder than that really warranted (though it did warrant it), hard enough to kill someone who wasn't a wizard. Maybe he's otherwise having a bad day.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You have an hour to read it over and request any changes to the terms," he says, and (apparently) leaves.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa is not under the impression she is alone.</p>
              <p>She sits down. Reads through the contract, which doesn't take an hour.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And then takes her bath. She's not sure when else she's going to have the opportunity.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>The most important thing to understand about a god is that, under almost all circumstances, and with extremely rare exceptions, their attention is not only divided but splintered.</p>
              <p>Perhaps unwittingly, perhaps not, Irori has threatened to get the better of Asmodeus in a bargain.</p>
              <p>Pride is among His domains.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus is a greater and much older god than Irori, closer to the center of all things.&nbsp; Compared to Irori, Asmodeus's facets are larger; the totality of the gem that is Him, vastly bigger.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus is also in many more places at once, compared to Irori.</p>
              <p>His decision must be the equivalent of a snap decision, made in reflex, in much less time than Irori had to think.</p>
              <p>Yet even His reflex thoughts are vast, and able.</p>
              <p>The bargain now sealed between Himself and Irori specifies much, to avoid Asmodeus getting the better of Irori in simple and obvious ways.&nbsp; He may not direct His church to specially monitor or distrust the mortal Carissa Sevar; nor, through the particulars by which the mortal is given freedom of travel in Cheliax if the time comes to sell its soul, may Asmodeus insinuate anything which works to that mortal's disadvantage, or makes it a target in the eyes of His church.&nbsp; Asmodeus is constrained in how He may expect the results of His commands to appear, their impacts upon the mortal.&nbsp; And there are old treaties regarding what the denizens of Hell may say to the living, besides.</p>
              <p>There is, nonetheless, a loophole in all that, if Asmodeus is giving an unbound mortal free passage through Cheliax.&nbsp; The whole affair must look at least a little odd.&nbsp; The contract cannot demand that these events <em>not </em>look odd.&nbsp; He cannot set His church upon the mortal, by direct command nor by insinuation and what He knows or suspects His church will conclude; He cannot disadvantage the mortal, cannot work against it; that does leave open other possibilities.</p>
              <p>It is possible that Irori, taking longer to think, foresaw this very loophole and that Asmodeus might try to exploit it, if Asmodeus thought the contract to His own favor at all, or regretted it after; and that Irori deliberately forebore to close it, because it is not Irori's way to protect mortals from trials.</p>
              <p>If so, Asmodeus will take that play.&nbsp; He does not know exactly what Irori saw when Irori looked at this mortal, but when Asmodeus looked at it, from His own angle, it did not seem like the sort of mortal looking to flee Cheliax at the first opportunity to take an atonement.</p>
              <p>And besides, if Asmodeus does not play this move, then Irori gets the better of Him in a contract.</p>
              <p>All this goes through a splintered facet of Asmodeus's attention in a fractional moment of reflex, before that splintered fragment directs a thought to a Duke of Hell who will not be shattered by it; and then goes on to other parts of His business, elsewhere on this plane.&nbsp; The thought consists of the relevant facts and a statement of intents; greater attention to the mortal details and specifying a precise policy around them is what underlings are for.</p>

              <p>But before he continues on to prove that yet again, he's going to lie here in bed with eyes closed a little longer, waiting for the muzziness to go away of its own accord.</p>
              <p>And then he'll either head off to find somebody for wizard lessons (Ione?) or maybe join people for dinner, depending on how long he actually slept, because once again he forgot about that part where he is no longer wearing a wristwatch.</p>

              <p>She should not assume she's alone but she doesn't have that much more stamina for maintaining composure. She kneels at her bedside in a distinctly imperfect posture for prayer and hides her face in her hands and trembles violently until it's possible to think about something other than the apparent deficit of air in this room. That takes a couple of minutes.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus noticed her. And Asmodeus has instructions for her. And Asmodeus does not want her to sell her soul, which -&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- okay, this is the most trivial feature of the situation, but it means she does not get permanent undispellable arcane sight, and she was really looking forward to that! And all of the other girls are going to have it! She's going to be falling behind in magic lessons and have no way to explain why. Not that she's ungrateful, but - Asmodeus could've given His instructions and also taken her soul -</p>
              <p>- presumably that's false, actually, presumably it's actually important for some reason that Carissa keeps her soul, she doesn't understand and she shouldn't expect to understand, the reason here is not going to be in that space where a human thinking about it really hard can comprehend it, it's going to be in the space that a human can't make any sense of at all.</p>
              <p>But there are some features of the situation that she ought to be capable of comprehending, or no one would have tried to tell her things.&nbsp;<br><br>Asmodeus noticed. He noticed that she was trying to build the true philosophy, the version that they would have come up in dath ilan where everyone is smarter and lawfuller and carefuller, if they were also Asmodean, and He thought it was worth directing her to do it properly. And His direction was -</p>
              <p>- she should write it down before she forgets -<br><br>She stops praying to do that.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Serve Me well in this world and you shall be raised high in it."</p>
              <p>"Remember that you are not Irori. &nbsp;Do not think yourself likely to succeed in perfecting yourself without divine aid."</p>
              <p>"Acknowledge the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis, and accept that your rightful place is in Hell."</p>
              <p>"Come to Me in Hell without thought of other choices, as mortals once did in the days before they were cursed with their own wills, and you shall be among the most treasured of My possessions."<br><br>And written down, it's kind of weird, and she puzzles over it for a little while -</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>She was trying to build Asmodeanism as smart lawful humans would have been able to generate it, able to understand it, able to build a society around it. But she was getting it wrong. "You are not Irori". What an odd thing to say, she didn't think she was Irori - well, maybe her vanity in fact got itself pointed that direction without her conscious attention - but she's not sure the problem is the<em> vanity,</em> because in the same breath she was promised to be raised high in the world, if she serves Asmodeus well in it, and among his most treasured possessions -</p>
              <p><br>"Acknowledge the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis..."</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- the problem is the&nbsp;<em>Lawful Neutral.&nbsp;</em>Keltham is Lawful Neutral. Keltham has taught her everything that she now understands, about the true theology, about what it would mean to have free will and&nbsp;<em>know what to do with it.&nbsp;</em>But Keltham is Lawful Neutral, even if he thinks he's evil, so his conception is a lawful neutral conception, of how things work.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And Carissa belongs to Asmodeus, who is Evil, and so she's supposed to be designing the&nbsp;<em>evil&nbsp;</em>version of that, not the neutral one.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa has not actually put a lot of thought into what Evil is. Pretty much everyone is Evil, because that's how Pharasma sorts them. Doing big ambitious things in the world is Evil. Keltham's probably going to start reading Evil at some point because he did <em>something</em> Pharasma objects to, he's not in the two percent most Good people and pretty much everyone else goes to Hell. But - when she says Keltham's Neutral she's not actually talking about what Pharasma has to say, she's talking about something else? Keltham assumes they're all getting paid. Keltham would be deeply upset if he learned they weren't getting paid, and it's not because it affects him in the slightest. His sense of - honor, fair play, however he contextualizes it - rules out slavery, rules out assassinations, rules out tricking people - they're jokingly betting on whether Keltham's a sadist and she bets he <em>is </em>but he didn't jump at punishing the students, he fretted that he had no idea how to do it in a way that improved their understanding of the subject material and was worried he'd teach them wrongly to be afraid of school -</p>
              <p>- she's not actually sure which parts of that are Lawful Neutral and which parts are dath ilan. But they stand out, as ways that an Asmodean is not. As ways that the ideal Asmodean theology would not be. And when she was trying to build something shaped like Keltham, Asmodeus Himself reached out and conveyed - that's too Lawful Neutral to be the truth. Give me the Evil version.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Well. Carissa can do that.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa has spent a lot of time worrying if she is loyal enough but almost none worrying if she is Evil enough. She's not squeamish. She doesn't refuse to report people out of misguided sympathy for them. She has whipped students who get bad grades, and practiced deadly spells on weeping prisoners. She is definitely going to go to Hell, and it did not really occur to her to specifically worry about how evil she was within the very broad category of everyone who gets sent to Hell. She hasn't heard of anyone getting in trouble for not being Evil enough. She hasn't even been threatened, now, with getting in trouble for not being Evil enough!&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>...and maybe that's the point. Because there's a kind of Evil built of pure, sharp, selfishness, the choice to be concerned with yourself, and not with any of the other idiots populating the world, the thing she told Keltham, Evil as prioritizing the self. She thinks she's perfectly adequate at that, if she does say so herself.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The devil wasn't like that. The devil saw her, spoke two minutes to her, and wanted to personally rip her into pieces. Because it'd be fun. Because, having seen her whole, destroying her would be more of a treat than destroying some other person. And there was a difference, though she hopes no one noticed it, when she stepped into his circle and threatened him back. He was threatening her because he felt like it. She was threatening him because she'd noticed that if she didn't learn to play she was going to lose very very fast.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She is pretty sure, in hindsight, that every Evil thing she's ever done has been the first kind, the weaker kind, the Evil of choosing Carissa Sevar over every other person in the universe. She feels entirely unapologetic about all of that Evil; certainly no other person in the universe is choosing Carissa Sevar over themselves. And if they were, that'd be stupid and contemptible of them.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And Asmodeus is saying that that's not enough. Well, it's clearly enough to get into Hell. It's not enough for the nature that devil possessed, not enough for her to actually succeed at the problem she has somewhat audaciously set herself, of explaining theology better so people aren't afraid of not understanding it any more than they're afraid of not understanding math, so they glimpse the outlines of the big, real thing there, even if that's all they glimpse.<br><br>'Acknowledge the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis'. Mainly it's the ...desire to be on the winning side, coupled with the conviction Axis isn't it, but she's pretty sure that's not what He means. What was it the devil said to Elias?</p>
              <p>She should write that down too, she's going to need to use it to argue for a headband.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Asmodeus's Queen and her slaves need not concern themselves proactively with Carissa Sevar's descent into cruelty, wickedness, and the darkness of her own soul; but if Carissa Sevar seeks to indulge of her own accord, she is to be prioritized for support as though she were the inheriting daughter of a Count of Cheliax."<br><br>It's embarrassing, but she never until this point considered that prominent leaders might be so cruel and wicked because they specifically got training and theological education in it, because it is part of what it means to be a servant of Asmodeus. Probably you can't offer that to the whole country because it won't run well if everyone's going around trying to develop their capacity for cruelty and wickedness. But you can offer it to the person who is trying to reform all of Asmodean theology.</p>
              <p>All right, what's an action plan for learning cruelty and wickedness and the darkness of her own soul. Possibly it makes sense to start by observation? She watched Contessa Lliratha and knew that she wanted that, wanted to grow up to be that, with an intensity that would have carried her through murdering lots of innocent people, which isn't&nbsp;<em>quite&nbsp;</em>the thing, but it's a start. ...possibly it makes sense to start by asking. She has specifically been told that she can get support, if she only asks.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There's another thing she needs to master, here. The other thing the devil had that she didn't was&nbsp;<em>presentation.&nbsp;</em>Carrying himself in the world like he did things for his own reasons - and of course they were Asmodeus's reasons, he said it outright, but - but he carried himself like he was enjoying every minute of it. Carissa carries herself like she's loyal and competent and pretty sure she is getting a good grade, and that's <em>not&nbsp;</em>how to get a good grade in wickedness. There's a reason Asmodeus said 'the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis', rather than just 'acquire some desires that have no place in Axis', and she doesn't think it's because she has a secret kink for torture, she would've noticed that. It's because that's a way you can relate to Evil, not as some habits of mind for the defense of the self under threat but as the delight of the self in pursuing all it pleases, and in serving those who have even more power to do that -</p>
              <p><em>I am ever your obedient servant,&nbsp;</em>she thinks at Asmodeus, though it feels a lot scarier now that she knows there's a minute chance he's paying attention.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>If magic lessons take anyone to the library at any point, they're going to encounter Ione Sala, who has now been healed in flesh if not in spirit.</p>
              <p>Very shortly after being healed, Ione Sala discovered that as soon as she gets a couple of dozen steps away from the library, she starts to feel a pull, a faint tingle, which she can intuitively feel would start to weaken her abilities after a time, and eventually rip her soul out of her body. &nbsp;She's going to need sleeping arrangements set up in here, or in a room connected to here, or for somebody to make her a bedroom that's also a library. &nbsp;And it doesn't feel like books are enough to make a place a library; people would need to be able to wander into her bedroom and read books there. &nbsp;Ione also knows that she needs to occasionally read some of the books, and get new books sometimes. &nbsp;They have to be books she actually wants to read; she can't just be doing it out of duty. &nbsp;Otherwise she'll die.</p>
              <p>Oracles get curses, don't they.</p>
              <p>...this curse isn't entirely a bad thing. &nbsp;It feels like Cheliax would have a hard time making there be a library that's also a torture chamber, and force her to enjoy reading books while she'd rather have her soul torn away so that the pain stops - like it would be hard to torture her to death over years in a way that satisfies her curse. &nbsp;Maybe she couldn't easily be <em>maledicted </em>either, with the grip that libraries now have on her soul? &nbsp;Is her curse one that takes her straight to Nethys's afterlife, is that why it feels like the curse would tear out her soul and not just kill her? &nbsp;Nethys - she's trying not to think thoughts like this, but they still bubble up in the back of her mind - Nethys may have a different attitude from Asmodeus about making sure that His own slaves, so long as they worked hard and did their best, get protected from sufficiently painful fates?</p>
              <p>No, she's being stupid. &nbsp;Nethys wants her to be less afraid of Asmodeus and Cheliax, obviously, so that she doesn't treat them as having equal power with Nethys to threaten her and force her obedience.</p>
              <p>...she wishes she hadn't thought that, it's going to make Cheliax trust her less after the next time they read her mind. &nbsp;The problem is that Ione is now living in such strange new circumstances that she doesn't know yet which paths of thought will lead her to dangerous places before she starts to think them. &nbsp;She does have to think now, and figure out what Nethys wants from her using her own wits. &nbsp;Nethys can't give her specific instructions because anybody Nethys touches goes mad.</p>
              <p>Ione has been taught since childhood that nobody really cares about her or ever would care about her, except for how she's of use to them; especially the gods, who could help, but don't.&nbsp; It's pathetic to think that Nethys would give her that curse because Nethys cared about one tiny worm that didn't even ask to be His cleric. &nbsp;Lots of mortals in the world die agonizing slow deaths and Nethys doesn't protect them. &nbsp;Asmodeus is the only god who has enough use for mortals in general being competent, not just a few favored clerics, to make sure that children in Cheliax get an education. &nbsp;And while it has occurred to Ione that this is propaganda, it has also occurred to her that it cannot just be a complete lie. &nbsp;It's not like Nethys made her His oracle, or helped her in any other way, before she was in a position to be useful to Him.</p>
              <p>But it's still - a little warm - to have a master who took real, visible steps to protect her against the worst that other masters can do.</p>
              <p>So she will do her very best for Nethys, as she has been thoroughly incentivized, which will include (Ione is very aware that she must think this and believe it as sincerely as she can) being very, very, very obedient to the Chelish government and not inconveniencing them at all, so they don't separate her from Keltham and replace her with an imposter.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>All right, let's try this the most direct possible way.&nbsp; Keltham internally contains a Read Magic cantrip and can feel the structure, which looks the same as the sketches in the textbook.&nbsp; That's useful for the visualization part.&nbsp; Keltham will then meditate and try to feel magic at his fingertips, like when he cast Resistance and Greater Detect Magic and the truth spell before - he <em>was </em>paying attention -&nbsp; as he holds his hand over a copy of Read Magic built up over somebody else's spellbook.&nbsp; He will try doing things with any magic he thinks he might be feeling, and be told what, if anything, happened when he made a motion.</p>
              <p>Possible hypotheses to distinguish include:</p>
              <p>- Keltham, as a being of dath ilan untouched by gods, will prove to have zero magical aptitude and unable to affect the magic in any way.&nbsp; (Seems unlikely if he's a cleric and cleric spells look the same as wizard spells.)<br>- Keltham will have unworkably low wizard aptitude, as a result of coming from a heritage that has never selected on itself at all for facility with wizardry.<br>- Keltham, having <em>not </em>come from a heritage in which wizards have had more access to contraception for however many generations, will do <em>great </em>at this.<br>- Keltham, having the mighty mental disciplines of dath ilan at his disposal, and having played a fair number of subtle perceptual computer games, will do great at this for reasons having nothing to do with genetics.<br>- Keltham will make a perfectly normal amount of progress for a Golarionite cleric with 18 Intelligence and zero prior magical exposure.<br>- The first ten minutes of testing will not be enough to distinguish any of these hypotheses, because they're going to initially produce flat failure and that would've been true for any realistic sort of human being.</p>

              <p>- well, maybe just to lay the Forbiddance, Forbiddance is permanent and can only be dispelled by a more powerful caster which is to say, if the Grand High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonn cast it, that it can't be -</p>

              </a>
            </div>
            <div class='post-content'><p>Aspexia Rugatonn, Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus, measures the woman kneeling before her with a careful eye and a half-dozen magics. &nbsp;If Carissa Sevar is an exceptional woman in ways beyond a native talent for wizardry, this is not yet evident. &nbsp;But then, if Sevar was that self-evidently extraordinary, she'd have been fast-tracked more than she was.</p>
              <p>There are not many times when Asmodeus intervenes directly in Cheliax; Aspexia prefers not to be ignorant about any of them. &nbsp;She is knowledgeable of history and secrets, though, and so less confused by this intervention than others might be. &nbsp;While other possible readings exist, the degree to which Church and Queen have been ordered not to take the initiative in originating actions impinging on Carissa Sevar are suggestive of circumstances having triggered some divine compact to which Asmodeus is signatory. &nbsp;The divine view of reality and negotiation gives more prominence than mortals do to notions of 'leaving things alone to become as they would otherwise have been'; perhaps because gods have been able to formulate a sensible notion of what that means between themselves, where mortals could not.</p>
              <p>An obvious further guess is that this compact's signatories include Irori among their number, and that Asmodeus is contesting with Irori for Carissa Sevar's soul in some ancient challenge governed by rules. &nbsp;Though if Carissa Sevar is wavering between Lawful Neutrality and Lawful Evil, Asmodeus is being unsubtle in His blandishments - the temptations more seem like inducements that would be offered to a soul already standing on Asmodean ground, not a soul wavering between a choice of paths. &nbsp;Overt blandishments for a soul to set proudly aside, while being more covertly tempted by a sense of being treated as important and valuable? &nbsp;Perhaps. &nbsp;Carissa Sevar's eidetically reported reaction seems not particularly expected of a nascent follower of Irori, but that could be a masquerade. &nbsp;Sevar has not been mindread more than she would be otherwise; they are not to be proactive about her correction.</p>
              <p>Someone else in Aspexia's position might wonder whether Asmodeus would be pleased, if she disobeyed Asmodeus's orders in order to preemptively insinuate temptations to Sevar, show her how important she could be, before Sevar had sought out theological instruction of her own accord. &nbsp;Such actions on a mortal's initiative would not, could not, cause Asmodeus to be in direct violation of divine compact.</p>
              <p>Aspexia does not even consider it. &nbsp;One of the foremost ways in which a Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus is shaped, is to predictably not behave in ways that make it more expensive for Asmodeus to keep His compacts. &nbsp;Improvising circles around your orders can rather tend do that. &nbsp;If Aspexia was the kind of priestess to circumvent her orders, Asmodeus would have needed to take that nature into account in choosing her orders.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>More importantly, when you are Asmodeus's priestess, the first and foremost thing you do is what Asmodeus has told you to do.</p>
              <p>In the situation as Aspexia Rugatonn mostly suspects it to be, a contest triggered between Asmodeus and Irori, there are many words that could be spoken to Carissa Sevar to benefit Asmodeus. &nbsp;There is a beastly, fleshly impulse that wants to find some excuse to maneuver Carissa into asking for instruction, to arrange the situation so that Carissa Sevar chooses to seek her descent into darkness - to win, herself, the challenge against Irori, to Asmodeus's glory.</p>
              <p>There is not the slightest chance that Aspexia Rugatonn will skirt the rules to try any of that. &nbsp;She's been told not to be proactive, and that is a plain instruction: hands off, don't speak to Sevar unless spoken to, Sevar is to cast aside her own will and not have it stripped from her. &nbsp;One of the many glorious benefits of being an Asmodean is that you can just follow orders.</p>
              <p>There are also other possibilities for why her Lord would have instructed them so. &nbsp;Sevar's soul may have had hidden value great enough that trying to exchange it for permanent arcane sight would have been too unbalanced a trade, and failed; and Asmodeus may not have wished this fact revealed to Sevar herself. &nbsp;Or Asmodeus may have some incomprehensible preference about this particular soul, it may have some ancient shape sentimental to Him, for which reason Asmodeus desires Carissa Sevar to come to Him in Hell and put aside her will of her own accord. &nbsp;There may be some benign process underway which would be interfered with by Sevar gaining arcane sight, and interfered with by other actions natural to Chelish agencies, which Asmodeus desires to be left alone to proceed to its foreseeable outcome.</p>
              <p>Or there may be many things going on at once, many pots that Asmodeus has in the fire, that His orders impact simultaneously.</p>
              <p>By simply obeying her orders and not improvising, Aspexia can avoid interfering with her Lord's plans in any of those cases.</p>
              <p>Some of the apparent confusion of these orders may be due to how Hell rendered down Asmodeus's will into words. &nbsp;Asmodeus's thoughts are too great for mortals to know, and reflect truths unspeakable in this world under divine compacts. &nbsp;Having those thoughts pass through a succession of devils, each younger and stupider and less bound by the compacts than the last, does not in any way surpass this fundamental barrier between start and finish; and if this were not so, all of Asmodeus's instructions would be passed by way of Hell. &nbsp;Then any process by which Hell tries to translate Asmodeus's thoughts into mortal language must inevitably change, and indeed, mutilate, those thoughts. &nbsp;There are both advantages and disadvantages of that process, compared to a direct divine revelation: &nbsp;On the one hand, there are wiser devils in Hell to oversee the initial stages of translation; but on the other hand, by the time the final words are heard, they are stripped of other overtones that mortals could hear directly in a god's voice.</p>
              <p>An apparently important subtlety of Hell's phrasing, seemingly key to a puzzle, may stem only from some devil phrasing something poorly and not foreseeing what a mortal would make of it.&nbsp; This is yet another reason to just follow Hell's commands without trying to brilliantly improvise around the fine edges of their exact details, when Hell has interpreted Asmodeus's will into mortal language; the commands' edges may not have been placed that finely.</p>
              <p>Aspexia Rugatonn has gotten this far in life by combining the executive capacity to manage fractious subordinates, plus great initiative and independence and ambition of her own, plus the cruel and tyrannical disposition to be a priestess of Asmodeus, with a genuinely intuitive understanding of why it can sometimes be a good idea to just follow your orders. &nbsp;Her ascendance to the peak of Asmodeus's church can be seen as inevitable, since there's only a billion or so people in Golarion and it is unlikely enough that even a single person like Aspexia Rugatonn came to exist there, let alone two. &nbsp;She worries about what will happen to her carefully crafted church after she dies.</p>
              <p>Oh, and there's also the fact that this entire affair has now been the subject of: two direct interventions of Asmodeus, four cleric circles bestowed from Abadar, two oracle circles from Nethys, possibly something to do with Irori, and two oracle circles from yet another unidentified Lawful Neutral god still under investigation. &nbsp;In retrospect, Aspexia really should have put up the Forbiddance first thing in the morning, no matter what else was on her schedule.</p>
              <p>It would be genuinely arrogant, under those circumstances, for Aspexia to imagine that she knows precisely what is going on and can plan precise dances around it.&nbsp; Thankfully, in this case, Asmodeus has given her orders by way of Hell, which she can follow.</p>
              <p>So Aspexia knows exactly - indeed trivially - what she plans to say to Sevar. &nbsp;Aspexia plans to say what Asmodeus's orders call for her to say.</p>

She wonders if there is a fashion of instructing students that imbues them with sufficient awe in their superiors without leaving them somewhat debiliatingly terrified in their actual presence; perhaps awe and terror go together inevitably, but if any place had decoupled them, dath ilan would have. And Keltham wasn't frightened by Contessa Lrilatha, though objectively speaking he should have been, and perhaps that was just an error.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It....seems likely that she is being reprimanded? If she had been proactive, and sought out the senior cleric stationed here, then Asmodeus could have delivered whatever instruction He intended -</p>
              <p>- except, He could do that anyway, right -</p>
              <p>- well, He said to seek it out proactively, and she hasn't done that yet, so if it's a test she failed, which is terrifying, except also, it has been less than an hour, and she spent the entire time reflecting on what questions she was going to ask so as to do the job properly! She's not complaining (even internally) that it is unfair, for her to have failed the test; the test is whether she's useful or not, and there's no fairness in that. No one shopping at the market and picking over vegetables, leaving out the bruised ones, worries that those ones aren't getting a fair shot. But it seems like the test isn't necessarily discriminating very well, if spending an hour thinking through what you're going to ask before asking is failing it.</p>
              <p>So possibly she is - not being reprimanded? Evidence for this theory: she isn't in even a little bit of pain! Possibly she is just being - because it's very unlikely that the offer to walk with Aspexia Rugatonn was extended without specific intent - reminded of what it means, to be raised high in this world by Asmodeus; reminded of what she has been offered, if she is good enough.</p>
              <p>And possibly she is being evaluated.&nbsp; Actually, that shouldn't have come to mind third. Asmodeus bothered with her; this is confusing; possibly it is confusing even to Aspexia Rugatonn, and she wants to know whether it is some specific feature of Carissa as a person which prompted the offer or whether it was, effectively, offered to the girl who got in with Keltham fastest, on the assumption all of them would be minimally competent from there - that doesn't quite fit, but she doesn't have a better theory to replace it with -&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- well, if it was something specific about Carissa, the only thing she can think of - the only thing that felt like a thought pattern no one else in Cheliax had thought before - was the question she was puzzling over during Keltham's lesson, about how to reconcile dath ilan's teachings of law and chaos and heredity and humans having been copied rather than created and what free will is. Her going interpretation, she thinks vaguely, of Asmodeus's message, was that she was being too Lawful Neutral; she was going to reconstruct it all and arrive at the wrong place. She is grateful for the warning, and intends to take it to heart, and won't try again until she's better at Evil. But presumably Asmodeus wouldn't have said anything just to save her from becoming a heretic and dying of it, so it must be important, in some way outside her; maybe, if she gets it right, she can convince Keltham. That's probably her top guess, if she had to name one. (What's confusing about it, what's the strongest argument against it.... well, if a really good theologian was projected to succeed at convincing Keltham, they'd have gotten a theologian in to do it, that's a little confusing.)</p>

              <p>"There exists a tension between two elements of Hell's interpretation given to us of Asmodeus's will; which is a hazard of Hell interpreting and distorting Asmodeus's will into such commands as may be spoken in language to mortals.&nbsp; We are, on the one hand, to reward you no less and no more than you have earned under Asmodeus's Law. &nbsp;On the other hand, to support you as though you were an inheriting daughter of a Countess, if you seek to indulge."</p>
              <p>"Interpreting and resolving such tensions, in Asmodeus's direct interventions conveyed by way of Hell, <em>is </em>ordinarily business of the Most High Aspexia Rugatonn. &nbsp;It is in this capacity that she is overseeing my own interactions with you now, in case I make any errors in my interpretation, while she had other business about this place."</p>
              <p>To all appearances, Paraduke Rathus Ratarion seems entirely unbothered by the prospect of needing to execute confusing instructions from Asmodeus-by-way-of-Hell with the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus watching him in case he requires correction. &nbsp;Perhaps he is, in fact, unbothered by it. &nbsp;This is unlikely to be among the hundred most stressful days of his life.</p>
              <p>"The Most High currently believes we are to resolve the tension in our instructions thus: reason as if you were the inheriting daughter of a Count of Cheliax, and decide your requests as though we were being asked what treatment of an inheriting daughter would be a matter of concern according to the principles of Her Infernal Majestrix's reign."</p>
              <p>"In regards to your request to seem more comely, if an heiress of a Count was being forced to grow up with an ordinary appearance, it would be a non-Asmodean behavior of small but noticeable concern to Church and Queen. &nbsp;If the pattern was repeated, or if it was done with deliberate attempt to prevent that heiress from indulging in vanity, it would become a matter of greater concern."</p>
              <p>"In such an event, I, Paraduke Rathus Ratarion, minister over the Asmodean culture of the nobility under Her Infernal Majestrix, would be dispatched by the Majestrix to speak to this hypothetical Count, inquire into any hidden reasons, and perhaps suggest a correction. &nbsp;In this case, the Count in question does not exist, and so the Count may be considered to have mounted no counterargument and yielded the issue." &nbsp;This statement is accompanied, very briefly, by that humorous grin which might look genuine to anyone who'd never been to Cheliax.</p>
              <p>"A wizard-potionmaker pair that has recently treated county heiresses has been located, and you will be conveyed there tomorrow for your first treatment.&nbsp; After dinner-time tomorrow, which, given your reported schedule, seemed least likely to cause you to miss any important lectures from the person that Hell referred to as your teacher. &nbsp;Despite the general importance and urgency of obeying Asmodeus's commands, I ruled out having it done at once, since the inheriting daughter of a Count would not have someone else's appointment canceled for her to accommodate her the same day as she made the request."</p>
              <p>"I will not ask if this is to your satisfaction, as a county heiress would not be so asked by myself.&nbsp; Nor is it appropriate for you to express gratitude towards me. &nbsp;I am not granting you favors. &nbsp;I am conversing with a hypothetical parent of yours regarding which indulgences are deemed a positive sign in a young Asmodean noble, and Her Infernal Majestrix's state is then acting in that absent Count's capacity using such resources as a Count would allocate."</p>
              <p>"If any of this process and reasoning seems less than completely understandable to you, speak now, as it concerns Asmodeus's commands and hence is of great importance to clarify.&nbsp; I may not be present here in person to interact with you in the future."</p>

              <p>"I would not hand you title to the souls of your rival women even if I could.&nbsp; While the goal is laudably Asmodean, it is not one which should be immediately satisfied in a Count's heiress as an indulgence. &nbsp;It would be more proper for her parent to instruct her to triumph over her rivals herself."</p>
              <p>"The request for a county is intriguing, and perhaps even, arguably, indulgent; but it seems to stretch the interpretation of the wording for prioritizing you as if you were an heiress, and to be too much of an unearned reward. &nbsp;While it was an admirably Asmodean ploy, I put forth on behalf of Her Infernal Majestrix, and the Most High agreed, that if such had been our Lord's true will, Hell's interpretation would have said to make you an heiress, not to prioritize your support as though you were one. &nbsp;We were sensible, of course, that you were likely just teasing poor Elias with that request, but Asmodeus's orders to us do not actually say that it matters." &nbsp;Another cheerful-appearing, humorous-appearing smile, which vanishes just as quickly as before.</p>
              <p>"You will receive by tomorrow's evening a lightly enchanted dueling dagger, whose wounds heal more easily but which causes greater pain.&nbsp; It will be simple in style, but suitable for a Count's heiress to carry, and would be appropriate for her to use to stab somebody who commented on her appearance."</p>
              <p>"You are permitted to argue these preliminary rulings, especially by reference to implications of Asmodeus's interpreted instructions which I may have failed to comprehend.&nbsp; Do you wish to do so?"</p>

              <p>"I can barely understand the matter, myself, but the Most High understands it better and it is she who instructs:&nbsp; This opportunity to speak <em>must not</em> be taken by you as a veiled order from the Most High."</p>
              <p>"If, however, there is anything you want to say about this entire affair, the Most High Aspexia Rugatonn bids me say to you in her presence that, should you have received other revelations from Asmodeus, or know of other relevant facts rendering this affair more understandable, she has not deduced on her own part that Asmodeus intended her not to hear of it."</p>

              <p>“Asmodeus has not otherwise communicated with me,” she says. “I - if I had to guess why me, my best guess was… during Keltham’s lessons I was trying to work out a reconciliation of the things dath ilan knows, about how humans came to be and how they learn and in what arenas they can learn the patterns gods run on, with theology as it was taught to me. And I think the instructions were perhaps aimed at - me doing that right, rather than how I was doing it, which was too Lawful Neutral.”</p>

              <p>Aspexia Rugatonn sometimes permits herself the vanity of thinking that she has come to understand a tiny bit of Asmodeus's divine frustration.&nbsp; No matter what orders Asmodeus gives, there is always some part of mortals - even of her, but she is managing it better - that thinks "obedience" means treating Asmodeus's orders as constraints, or worse, hints as to what Asmodeus is really trying to do, by which means the mortal can helpfully understand what Asmodeus is really trying to do, and then cleverly navigate around the edges of Asmodeus's order-constraints to accomplish that better.</p>
              <p>Aspexia has <em>tried </em>telling other people that they need to become more the sorts of beings that Asmodeus can easily and safely steer using brief instructions.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to help.&nbsp; Nobody other than her ever <em>gets it.&nbsp; </em>She is speaking some word that is not in the innate language of their being.</p>
              <p>Aspexia once devised the parable of a three-year-old child whose owner must instruct it to navigate it through a dungeon full of traps, using a limited budget of words.&nbsp; To teach her student clerics how the world must look from Asmodeus's perspective.&nbsp; To make them ask themselves how much they'd want the child to plainly follow direct orders where it got those, versus showing creative initiative for all the cases its orders didn't seem to cover, versus responding quickly to the unexpected, versus the child trying to deduce what its orders "really meant" and going the extra mile on its owner's inferred goals.</p>
              <p>The parable didn't work, so she requisitioned access to a dungeon and bought some three-year-olds and tried making her clerics actually run the exercise.&nbsp; So they could see what happened when the three-year-old acted towards them like they were acting towards Asmodeus.</p>
              <p>It still didn't help.&nbsp; There seems to be something about the concept that is contrary to the nature of a mortal soul.&nbsp; Mortals just end up with&nbsp;<em>goals,</em> even if you tell them to take Asmodeus's goals as their own they still end up with&nbsp;<em>goals</em>, mortals don't just <em>obey</em> they end up with a&nbsp;<em>goal of obedience</em> and then they start trying to figure out how to dance around the edges of Asmodeus's instructions so they can&nbsp;<em>obey Him even more.</em>&nbsp; Aspexia can see what they're doing wrong, but she has never been able to successfully get that concept inside of a fellow mortal.&nbsp; She can talk it at her flock but they're still mortals after she's done talking.&nbsp; The training games she's devised didn't seem to help much outside of the specific games themselves.&nbsp; The way that a mortal <em>should </em>obey, the way that a distant god who can't communicate clearly and doesn't have much time to think about them would <em>want </em>them to obey - "corrigibility", she once tried naming it to her flock - it's just so <em>alien to a mortal's nature.</em></p>

              <p>I'm not that smart, and I'm not sure anyone is, past the end of prophecy, but there's a simpler approach, of tracking down those impulses that this conversation might have unwisely insinuated into Carissa, and choking them off, and preserving myself in the state of one who has attracted no proactive interest whatsoever, while still having told you everything useful I can. I will try, because it is my desire to be inexpensive for Asmodeus to direct, and because it is my desire to get your advice without you being obliged by my inability to avoid following it to barely give it in the first place. But I suspect my trying will be imperfect, because I am not smart enough to contain a Carissa; I&nbsp;<em>am&nbsp;</em>one.&nbsp;</p>

They have dangerous ideas and dangerous inventions which aren't known to Keltham, held by Keepers, but probably possible to derive independently, and Keltham doesn't know how they handle people who derive them or which things he shouldn't reinvent.

            <div class='post-content'><p>Aspexia thinks.&nbsp; The more thoughts of her own she has, so long as she holds them lightly, the easier it will be for Asmodeus to point to any of them, if any of them are correct.&nbsp; If, indeed, this matter merits Asmodeus's attention at all.&nbsp; It -&nbsp;<em>could</em> be that Nethys and Otolmens have some rivalry after the fashion of more ordinary gods?&nbsp; Nethys dropping two oracle circles, followed by Otolmens responding with two oracle circles, is suggestive of that.&nbsp; It could be that there is some more ordinary divine game going on and not the world ending.&nbsp; Asmodeus isn't acting like the world is ending, and Abadar shouldn't be dropping four cleric circles on somebody who's going to end it.</p>
              <p>Aspexia spares a moment of frustration for how it is impossible for consecrations, forbiddances, wardings, or literally anything else, to keep Nethys out of anything.&nbsp; Ordering Nethys's oracle killed and <em>maledicted </em>would be an obvious tactic, but Nethys's oracle seems like she might be harder than usual to <em>maledict,</em> or even take <em>out of her library.</em>&nbsp; Which means that Nethys was<em> thinking</em> about Chelish responses, not just being insane.&nbsp; And if they kill Ione Sala and Nethys's clerics resurrect her, then Nethys's clerics may find out what's going on here with Keltham, if they don't already know.</p>
              <p>"I will soon pray to Asmodeus.&nbsp; My default intention, which Asmodeus may choose not to correct, will be to equip Otolmens's oracle with invisibility items and a weapon and permit him to monitor and intervene in events in this facility as he wishes.&nbsp; He will have pointed out to him Keltham and Ione Sala - she is now, allegedly against her own will, an oracle of Nethys, if you had not been informed of that - as possible objects of his attention.&nbsp; Do you, Sevar, wish to offer any corrections, however slight, to my default plan?"</p>
