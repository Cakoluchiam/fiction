              <p>As it happens, though, Ferrer Maillol is currently in a state unusually apt to receive messages from Asmodeus, who has a message to deliver.&nbsp; It conveniently concerns a matter on which Maillol has already been partially instructed.</p>
              <p>And Asmodeus does need to do this often enough, if very very rarely, that people ever hear about that time Asmodeus did it once.&nbsp; That way they'll go on sincerely pleading to Him in the extremity of their torture, which He enjoys.</p>
              <p>Besides, it's amusing.&nbsp; Have a vision, tiny squirrel!&nbsp; Asmodeus in His finite mercy has given you a temporary reprieve from all the infinite torment that will someday be yours.</p>

              <p>While he stutters, rapid messages delivered by magic where Keltham can't hear:</p>
              <p>Queen's transcript is ready for Sevar.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus has given them a directive to move Keltham to a new location, one that will somehow be more protected from divine interference than even the palace, as soon as Aspexia can get a new Forbiddance spell and put that up tomorrow at dawn.&nbsp; They're not to spare any expense, this time; Cheliax is suddenly wealthier than expected, for reasons to be described later.</p>
              <p>The anti-interference divine protection <em>should </em>prevent any more oracles from being created, even if someone on site isn't soul-sold.</p>
              <p>Maillol is still recovering.&nbsp; Sevar's input is requested in Maillol's place about the new project setup.&nbsp; Possibly Keltham's input should be solicited too?</p>
              <p>What do they tell Keltham, what message does the page have for Keltham?&nbsp; <em>Some </em>lies seem required and Sevar is the only one who can authorize them.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Two of the Securities peel off as soon as they're out of sight of Keltham's door and get on with their real jobs.&nbsp; The remaining one escorts Carissa to a room where she can review her notes, and hands her a sealed packet that contain the Queen's slightly censored transcript of Keltham's thoughts.<br><br></p>
              <p>The Security also recounts recent events at somewhat greater length.</p>
              <p>Rather a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of diamonds suddenly materialized around Otolmens's oracle.</p>
              <p>There's an obvious thought about where those diamonds might have come from, and their best hopes there seem to be actually coming true.&nbsp; Nidal shifted to a more tightly defensive, conservative, and dare one hope, <em>worried</em> posture afterwards.&nbsp; It's not the same kind of game-over as if Zon-Kuthon had been destroyed and his clerics depowered, but the remaining timeline is looking like months, not years.</p>
              <p>Nobody has any good idea of <em>how</em> Nidal managed to piss off Otolmens this much, except, obviously, that it had something to do with Nidal's intentions for Keltham.&nbsp; It nonetheless implies that people should tread <em>even more carefully,</em> which shouldn't, in fact, be possible in the first place when you are dealing with an Otolmens event, but nonetheless, do consider, this is what happens when Otolmens gets <em>pissed.</em>&nbsp; If anybody manages to piss Otolmens off <em>at Cheliax instead,</em> then perhaps all the diamonds in Cheliax will be teleported to Lastwall!&nbsp; It is the considered belief of Grand High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonn that this would be a bad idea, and people should not do it!&nbsp; Or come close to doing it.&nbsp; Or think too much about doing it.&nbsp; Or do anything that is 'not technically doing it'.&nbsp; Or do something that really shouldn't piss Otolmens off <em>that </em>much if Otolmens is being reasonable.&nbsp; Just don't, fucking, mess, with Otolmens.&nbsp; If anybody thinks that Rugatonn is trying to tell them anything especially complicated here, they should come to Rugatonn for clarification about how she is really, in fact, saying something very simple.&nbsp; Or they can just kill themselves directly.&nbsp; Rugatonn is happy with either outcome.</p>
              <p>Maillol, who received Asmodeus's vision while being personally tortured by Gorthoklek, briefly and barely pulled himself together to communicate the bones of their Lord's vision:&nbsp; Asmodeus communicated a complex attitude about Otolmens's sudden gift, which suggests that Otolmens has well overpaid for the new project to have adequate security precautions; and while they shouldn't even remotely try to spend as much as Otolmens actually paid, they're not supposed to just take the money and run, either.</p>
              <p>The new project location will have <em>actual fucking security</em> this time, and any complaints about the budget should be considered in the light of Otolmens's apparent concern and corresponding generosity.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus's sent vision requires very strongly that Keltham needs to be not too far from Ostenso.&nbsp; Asmodeus's vision implies that Keltham should be within the designated region the moment it's safe; so as soon as a new Forbiddance can be put up, somewhere Nidal hopefully won't know about; hence, shortly after dawn tomorrow when Rugatonn can request a Forbiddance spell.</p>
              <p>They're currently thinking of renovating an old coastal fortress.</p>

              <p>Carissa's preferred thing to tell Keltham about this is the truth, that Cheliax is acting on orders from Otolmens; she thinks that Keltham is more likely to break rules in a way that offends Otolmens accidentally than he is to do so deliberately, and if he were doing it deliberately he'd likely at least take cautionary measures like running it by Carissa first or maybe talking to Broom. Otolmens intervention seems like the sort of thing that might be clearer from Keltham's perspective than theirs and which is therefore going to end up being even harder to hide. She assumes Aspexia Rugatonn will veto this, so she wants to give a story that <em>isn't incompatible&nbsp;</em>with telling him that later, which probably means just telling him that the relocation is for Security reasons they can't disclose at this time.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa would appreciate a further briefing on known things about Otolmens, at some point.</p>
              <p>Coastal fortress seems fine. Keltham seems plenty attached to luxury, even knowing how desperately poor everyone in the world is; she isn't sure if it'll actually hit him for Evil if they fund his luxuries with brutal taxation of some distant village but it seems worth exploring. Plumbing is a must.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She assumes from the fact the packet is sealed that she is intended to read it alone.</p>

              <p>Security also notes that Cheliax, of course, acts on only Asmodeus's orders, even if Asmodeus perhaps bargains with other gods as part of His business; even Otolmens surely would not dare to <em>instruct</em> Him so, or give Him <em>orders</em> to pass along, and the generosity of Her payment suggests that She bargained with Asmodeus from a position of weakness.&nbsp; To suggest that Cheliax is in any way acting on <em>Otolmens's orders</em> would be a lie, which Sevar is welcome to authorize explicitly.&nbsp; (Weirdly, Security does not hurt her about this.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Hmm. With approval from the Grand High Priestess, she wants them to tell Keltham that their present understanding is that Broom's god of messes requested the move and heightened security generally, and that Asmodeus instructed it, and maybe even that the instruction was specifically to go somewhere near Ostenso. The most obviously useful thing here is Keltham being reluctant to leave the area, though mostly Carissa's operating on the assumption that this has weird correlates she can't see.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And she'll take a look at the transcript now. She does not ask if that means her mind won't be read while she reads it; it might instead just mean her mind is being read directly by Abrogail or something, and anyway 'my mind isn't presently being read' is a bad starting point for thought.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Abrogail's transcript contains a censored section right at the most exciting part about the Second Law, with notes saying that Keltham thought things about other people's knowledge of these truths driving them insane and possibly collapsing the universe, that most of his thoughts were incomprehensible ideas with no remote conceptual neighbors in any language that Abrogail knows, and that the parts that did make it through were incredibly fucking disturbing.&nbsp; Abrogail is obviously saying this because she knows how terribly curious it will make Sevar about the one part she most wanted to know, <em>but it is also true</em>, and Rugatonn requires further thought on whether Sevar gets to see this.</p>
              <p>Abrogail has included a more detailed explanation of why Sevar is being tortured, with particular torture codes from her sheet being noted at particular points that all sum up exactly to the total amount of torture she received in her original note.</p>
              <p>The most severe torture code is annotated on the section where Keltham thought about his secret plan to establish a fully legible meta-level signal via the no-verbal-objections order.&nbsp; This looks like a huge setback for their corruption plans.&nbsp; If Sevar noticed this at all, which was <em>her </em>job, then she didn't think about it in words and it didn't show up in her thought transcript, meaning Abrogail got blindsided here.&nbsp; Abrogail isn't sure how to recover, Sevar didn't say anything to the effect of how most masochists wouldn't go along with it even if Sevar herself is fine, or how she could do it for a month no problem but after any longer of not being allowed to scream and beg she would probably start to feel sad.&nbsp; Maybe when Keltham gets to the appropriate point Sevar can confess that she's starting to feel sad.&nbsp; Keltham is unfortunately <em>explicitly suspicious</em> that Cheliax is trying to lure him into rape.&nbsp; But even if Sevar's opinion is that any objection to Keltham's plan would have made him too suspicious, Sevar didn't apparently notice, and definitely didn't report it explicitly.&nbsp; Bad Sevar, go to your torture room.</p>
              <p>The second-worst torture code is for Sevar thinking about how the Queen of Cheliax was being <em>stupid </em>for saying a 'worse version' than the one Sevar suggested.&nbsp; When, in fact, the Queen of Cheliax has higher Perception than Sevar can fucking dream of and it was warning her off Sevar's version verbatim, possibly because Keltham would've been able to identify it as coming from Sevar.&nbsp; Sevar's failure to <em>imagine</em> that the Queen of Cheliax could have any good reason for <em>presuming to not do exactly what Sevar said</em> reveals an actual problem of subordination here and that's why this punishment is severe.&nbsp; Thinking about lighting Abrogail on fire despite knowing you might get punished for thinking that was not the problem, that's just flirting and will be dealt with separately.</p>
              <p>The third-severest torture code, also appearing in the original sum of codes Carissa was given, is the fee for making the fucking Queen of Cheliax spell all this out for Sevar in the annotations because Sevar apparently cannot imagine her Queen ever being professional about anything.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>- okay, you know what, that's actually completely reasonable. And it's true that Carissa has been having a hard time imagining her Queen being professional about anything, though in her defense, that's because -</p>
              <p>- well, the thing Keltham said, about how a pragmatic person in the Queen's position would simply have sex with someone other than Carissa.</p>
              <p>But. The Queen is who she is, and wants what she wants, and is clearly quite good at her job while wanting some things that offer constraints on how she does her job, and Carissa was in fact underrating that, internally, assuming the Queen was less capable than she was, and the punishment is warranted, and she should have assumed the punishment would be warranted. She'll get it done before she leaves for a coastal fortress in Ostenso.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She's extremely annoyed about the part she really wants being censored, but she thinks nonetheless she understands the Second Law stuff well enough to be working around, now, and well enough to be considering some strategies like saying dramatically ironic things that have no payoff at all because reality doesn't actually pay attention to dramatic irony. (Keltham made a&nbsp;<em>face,&nbsp;</em>when she asserted she wasn't a Kuthite spy.)</p>
              <p>She has several ideas for working around the no-order thing, though she didn't see what Keltham was playing at until the transcript and isn't delighted by it. Firstly, she's not actually sure that it wouldn't ding a person for Evil, if they are in the habit of ordering their slaves not to refuse them and vaguely intend that, if ever disobeyed about that, they'd stop the game and let the slave go. In Carissa's particular case it's going to be more complicated but as a general order Keltham's in the habit of giving it seems in some ways advantageous; maybe they can arrange for him to give that order to someone else who 1) will understand Keltham's intent as the obvious 'you are not entitled to refuse me, so don't', 2) has adequate self-control and won't in fact trigger it and 3) (this one might be inconvenient) will react with arousal to treatment they desperately wish they weren't subject to. And then make it gradually clearer to Keltham over time that the reason he's being obeyed is because he's entitled to obedience, not because it's sexy per se. Secondly, Carissa's planning to eventually raise with Keltham that always following orders is in fact less sexy than sometimes breaking orders and being suitably punished for that, so hopefully he can just not-update the orders about 'no' as they gradually transition to a model where he doesn't have her obedience so much as the right and means to compel it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Can someone alert Carissa please when Maillol's competent to take over project duties, and in the mean time hand her any project related work that's been sitting, so she can hand it off to him in relatively good shape while she goes for her punishment?</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(She's not scared, even though she's definitely never had half an hour before and knows this kind of thing is not linear in effects. That would be pathetic, and she's not that pathetic.)</p>

              <p>Keltham quickly seats himself, his thoughts showing an intention not to waste Isidre's valuable time; he requested this meeting and Isidre may not have her schedule cleared for it.</p>
              <p>"I've probed my newfound sexuality some, and arrived at some answers," Keltham says.&nbsp; "So, first, I'm pretty sure that I do not currently want, for my own sake, to demand that Cheliax hand over Carissa to me, and I can appreciate that it would be missing the point to do it for hers.&nbsp; Maybe I'll find the 'gendertrope'* inside me, the sexual behavior pattern and way of thinking, that's the complement of hers, where I actually want absolute-power over Carissa enough that I want to go do that for myself.&nbsp; But it's not there or not awake yet, and I'm not doing that until it is."</p>
              <p><br>(*)&nbsp; Baseline 'gendertrope' does not contain the syllable for the Baseline 'trope'; the sounds of the words are distinct.</p>

              <p>"I - think Carissa has some equivalent of what a dath ilani would call 'dignity', which translates via Share Language to Taldane dignity but I suspect is really not the same thing at all.&nbsp; Carissa's 'dignity' is that she is impossible to truly hurt, even by running a sword through her and then refusing to Raise her, which is what makes it safe for the man to whom she's completely given herself to do anything he wants with her, and not be afraid."</p>
              <p>"And if we were all in dath ilan, she could tell me that was true, and I would maybe check in with a Keeper first to see if they thought Carissa was in generally good," epistemic health, "belief-health, but then the fact that Carissa thought that was true about herself would be very reliable evidence, because <em>dath ilani know how to see within themselves if that sort of thing is actually true.</em>"</p>
              <p>"The fact that I got trained in that explicitly, and warned about a lot of pitfalls, suggests that, if that training actually did anything, Chelish people should actually be much worse at distinguishing - what&nbsp;<em>should</em> be true about themselves, what they&nbsp;<em>want</em> to be true about themselves, from what actually&nbsp;<em>is</em> true about themselves."</p>
              <p>"I'm worried that Carissa is just answering me from within her model of what Carissa&nbsp;<em>should be</em> and that model is not rigorously separated and distinguished from what Carissa&nbsp;<em>is.</em>&nbsp; Which seems like the really obvious mistake that, say, I would make, if you took all the dath ilani training out of somebody otherwise with my exact heritage."</p>
              <p>"If I try to discuss this with my Carissamodel, my Carissamodel says back that Chelish dignity also says that it's her place to safeguard her own safety and not rely on anybody else to protect her when she's giving herself away, that it would be undignified for her to be relying on me to think about her safety.&nbsp; I don't then feel happy and reassured when my Carissamodel says this back to me, and I don't know where to go from there."</p>

              <p>An observation that might be useful to Keltham is that - by the standards of dath ilan, it's plausible that almost no one is competent to know what they actually want and what they can withstand, and yet they do still have to make decisions and do things, and it can simultaneously be true that they might be wrong and that it is impossible to do better than treating them as if they're right, until one encounters actual reason to think they're specifically wrong about something specific; trust withheld in full generality can be damaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Another might be that one commonly solves this by hurting their Carissa to her breaking point such that they subsequently know what it is, and Keltham probably literally isn't capable of that yet, but the fact he's not also means this isn't very urgent.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Ah, Keltham. Carissa thinks her preferred phrasing might've been better in that regard but yields to Abrogail's superior Splendour. It's like - it's like if the thing you're trying to do is figure out who to send on patrol, and if someone brings up that those two just had a bad breakup and won't get along, your job isn't convincing them they're <em>wrong</em>, it's <em>figuring out what the best patrol group is with the new inputs</em>. Act like the decision power is already yours and you don't need to convince anyone, and then like you need the patrol to nonetheless perform well against demons.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>One objection to what Abrogail just said is that it proves too much, Keltham shouldn't buy and abuse literal children (yes he should but they're not going to get him there yet). So it might be worth acknowledging his concerns as perhaps outweighing her clever response in some cases, but pointing out that Carissa was judged competent by her society to swear the Worldwound oath, which is as competent as her society is capable of acknowledging her to be, and so even if one doesn't want to declare everyone competent until proven otherwise they could extend it at least to those who've served at the Lawfullest place in Golarion.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(Modulo carefulness to not come across as too good at reading Keltham, but Abrogail knows that.)</p>

              <p>There's really something to be said for doing things and checking whether they have good or bad consequences, assuming the consequences are recoverable.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Also he could just directly bring this to Carissa, she'll in fact probably be upset and definitely at least somewhat turned-off but that's only a consideration against it, not absolute reason if he's too stuck.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(She's...better at self-deception than most people, it's pretty obvious by now; her self-deceptions go deeper, grow more roots. She didn't just learn to quash the thought 'Abrogail makes mistakes', she uprooted everything nearby, replaced with 'you are too ignorant of the constraints on Abrogail to ever evaluate anything she does as a mistake'.)</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa has only tried being emotional at Keltham once and what happened was that he decided he needed to invent contraception about her sadness, it was very confusing, Isidre should be glad he's not handling Isidre's emotions like that. Maybe dath ilan encourages that because they don't want their people emotionally manipulable and also don't want them to learn to simply not care about other people.</p>

              <p>That hypothesis makes this more valuable to you as a test of his tropes theory though you understand why he wouldn't see it that way. You have lots of observations about how incredibly implausible it'd be for the Queen to steal Carissa, but you aren't sure how they hold up in tropeworld. In the actual, logical world, though, incredibly unlikely.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Also, though he has good reason to put this line of thought on hold, the Queen would absolutely respect a preexisting arrangement, even if things are running on...tropes...she couldn't be the Queen of Cheliax if she broke a preexisting agreement between Keltham and Cheliax over Carissa, such as that she is his.</p>

              <p>I think if you lose Carissa, it won't be because the Queen stole her heart with her superior ruthlessness and sadism, it'll be because you shy away from using your own. A girl can be happy with a wide range of masters but not with one who isn't Evil, not with one who isn't interested in discovering what's in his heart however dark it is. And I think you're at risk of that problem even if you tell the Queen to go on her merry way.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Her sincere honest answer is that Keltham is more - something, the phrase she immediately thought of is 'terrifyingly creative' but she's 100% sure she will regret with great intensity having questioned the Queen of Cheliax's terrifying creativity - more dath ilani, the space of solutions he draws from is larger and once he gets competent he'll be able to use the Golarion pool too - he clearly thought he had a way of doing safe Wishes that might work and she can't even tell him he's obviously wrong -</p>
              <p>- anyway, he's more <em>something </em>than the Queen of Cheliax and the Queen of Cheliax would beat him without trying in a ruthlessness contest or a solving your problems with any of murder petrification and mind control contest, but Asmodeus has committed to letting Keltham leave Cheliax alive and in one piece, and given that she thinks Keltham would win this contest, if both of them were trying. And also it's obviously not in Cheliax's interests to let it come to that, though it's maybe in Cheliax's interests to make Keltham realize that he does, actually, want to be the person who would have absolute power over Carissa even if he doesn't quite yet want to exercise it.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Tell him if he'll walk out over me then he does win. And that - caring that much about me - is indeed something the Queen can't compete with, and the key to Carissa's sexuality, or as close to it as a person who still runs into a wall of Good every time he tries to have desires can comprehend it.</p>

              <p>Well.&nbsp; It's clear enough that Sevar thinks that Keltham has already won this contest, and with it her heart; so the question then becomes, does Abrogail Thrune choose to permit Sevar to go on believing that, and to convince Keltham of it too.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"That Carissa's sexuality depends on the <em>truth</em> of two propositions that can't both simultaneously be true is, itself, very much a 'trope', and one of the deepest and most powerful ones.&nbsp; Even more than the Queen of Cheliax being a <em>complication</em>, even more than her coming into <em>conflict </em>with me, the deepest 'trope' here has to be the <em>question-of-fact</em>, what is really true.&nbsp; Everything else fell into place once I realized that."</p>
              <p>"My proposal is as simple as it is unfair to the Queen.&nbsp; If I meet her and know her and think she's worthy of Carissa at all, I offer to negotiate the rental agreement for Carissa.&nbsp; In front of her advisors.&nbsp; And with Carissa there to see it, because she's the one who has to know this truth and witness it.&nbsp; I say plainly" (a dath ilani does not bother to add 'and truthfully' if they're bothering to let words leave their mouth at all) "that I'm worried about a more experienced sadist stealing Carissa from me, and if the Queen of Cheliax does that successfully, I will walk out on Cheliax and go make a revolution somewhere else.&nbsp; I say that I want guarantees about my right, signed by the government of Cheliax and by the Queen and by the Church of Asmodeus in whatever capacity Asmodeus recognizes such things, to take Carissa with me if that happens, potentially including against her own will, if I so choose, to somewhere that puts enough value on a dath ilani to also recognize my possession of her."</p>
              <p>"Having that right doesn't mean I'd actually exercise it, obviously, but nobody needs to say that in front of the Queen; and while Carissa might know what I wouldn't really do, I think she'll also understand the romantic gesture in the spirit in which it was intended."</p>
              <p>"If everybody's being sane, the Queen and her advisors are like, sure, sounds weirdly extreme but he's obviously doing it to impress his girlfriend, they sign on like the totally sane grownups they are.&nbsp; The limits on the Queen's sadism are in a sealed section of the compact that I trust you to write.&nbsp; The conflict <em>and the 'trope'</em> have been defused, easily enough to call into severe question whether there was ever really any 'trope' at work in the first place."</p>
              <p>"If the Queen is like, why, no, how could I possibly do <em>that</em>, I have strange reasons I cannot do <em>that</em>, then we know she's a giant 'trope' avatar and there's a foretold path of conflict and complication whose core question-of-truth is who Carissa Sevar really belongs to - both de facto and in terms of her core sexuality, because those two are the same thing."</p>
              <p>"In which case, obviously, I stop negotiating that rental agreement, get back to my new research installation, and both we and the Queen's advisers do everything we can to keep the Queen and Carissa apart for as long as possible.&nbsp; We do everything we can to, like, totally slow down all of that from actually happening, if that is at <em>all</em> possible, and try to delay everything into the future as far as possible, because, like, I already have a job."</p>
              <p>"Eventually either the Queen loses power, or the two of us reconcile and kiss, or, if I screw up along the way, the Queen wins and Cheliax stays poor for longer.&nbsp; Or Golarion ends up falling to the Worldwound because there wasn't really anywhere else that could offer the resources that Cheliax and Asmodeus could.&nbsp; I suppose there's other possibilities within the 'tropes' that would then almost have to be governing, but I'd have to think hard about what they were; they'd be less probable."</p>

              <p>All right.&nbsp; Abrogail thinks she is going to have to proceed under the assumption that the 'tropes' are real, and govern here.</p>
              <p>Her reasoning is not complicated; why, Sevar herself might see it if Sevar had the requisite +6 headband of all mental attributes.</p>
              <p>Keltham thinks he's describing a future event that he has to arrange in accordance with 'tropes'.&nbsp; That event has&nbsp;<em>already happened, without Keltham knowing it.</em>&nbsp; He has been fighting the true Queen this entire time, in front of Carissa, and, apparently to Carissa for now, won.</p>
              <p>In dath ilan's rhythm of prediction, success, credibility, that is a victory he has won.</p>
              <p>Abrogail has worked out by now a wordless sort of apprehension as to what sort of things 'tropes' are, namely, things out of stories, except that they're not the 'tropes' of Cheliax or Golarion, they're the 'tropes' of dath ilan.&nbsp; But if dath ilan has, per transcript, girls who dream of becoming Dark Unilateral Rulers, then dath ilan surely <em>also </em>has a 'trope' for appearing to have won when you haven't, because the person you're fighting is smarter than you and you never knew how many of your plans were known to her from the beginning.</p>
              <p>More the fool Keltham, if that thought hasn't occurred to him; and more the fool Carissa, if, knowing the true place of the Queen of Cheliax in all of this, it hasn't occurred to her to wonder the same.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>...or she could just not decide to do any of that, and then her life wouldn't be a 'trope'.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Possibly then there wouldn't be any 'tropes' around at all, she's not sure how that works.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Ice and fire alternate, in an unoccupied room nearby.&nbsp; Cycling between the two prevents the floors and walls from melting; it's not Abrogail's first time venting emotion where her adversaries will not see that and be warned.</p>

              <p>In the end, the logic behind Abrogail's last decision here is simple.</p>
              <p>She doesn't actually want to spend the rest of her life like this.</p>
              <p>She'd rather not be a 'trope'.</p>
              <p>In fact, she now <em>deeply </em>desires that there be no 'tropes' anywhere near Cheliax.&nbsp; Ever.</p>
              <p>And while she's not quite sure that this is how any of this works, she's going to do her part there.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"Well, then," Isidre says, and sighs.&nbsp; "I suppose you should go back and talk to Carissa and determine how she feels about being rented to the Queen, and I should see if you can meet the Queen at least briefly.&nbsp; And then maybe move directly to the confrontation with her and her advisors in sight of Carissa, then or very soon after.&nbsp; If everyone is sane, which I <em>do </em>expect them to be, Keltham, it should actually get done quite quickly - or I certainly hope so, because these are all very busy people.&nbsp; But time today is no more time than time tomorrow, and if possible we may as well get this done while we can do it without burning Teleports."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Is your proposal here that we read in a couple hundred people on everything we know about the secret that may have started the godwar.... so that the betting markets resolve."</p>
              <p><br>"Yes," the Prince Merenre says. "Precisely because something about the situation may have started a godwar. It's important, so we need to be competent to reason about it, so the betting markets need to be something more than a fancy layer of fuzziness on top of all my personal guesses."</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I trust precisely thirty people with this," says the pharaoh of Osirion. "And all of them know better than to bet against you, ever, about anything where they don't have inside information."</p>
              <p><br>"In principle we can fix that with more lopsided payoffs," says Merenre. "They can't be infinitely confident in my being better than them."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I predict their bets-against-you will cluster around yours, if they're allowed to know yours, and maybe even if they aren't. What I want here is people who'll think of something you haven't. And less of a&nbsp;<em>spread - </em>because come on,&nbsp; this is ridiculous -"</p>
              <p>"Where are the markets at right now?" a serious, stiff-robed priest asks.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Our&nbsp;<em>eighty percent confidence interval&nbsp;</em>spans 'totally useless except to Abadar and three mathematicians' to 'the destruction of the multiverse'".</p>
              <p>"- how are they even resolving that -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, the usual. That's not the point, the point is, I can't govern like this."</p>
              <p><br>"What if we get predictors from Axis," says the King-Consort. "They've got better participation than us, there's a convenient list of exactly who to ask-"</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Can't afford them."</p>
              <p>"If this project is as important as the 50th percentile projection, we can give them the Sphinx."</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "- there's a policy proposal, I guess, raffle off every archeological relic in the country, except our God in his wisdom has copies of all of them already -"</p>
              <p><br>"Can you ask Him to pay to subsidize the prediction markets in Aktun?" says Merenre tiredly. This is technically a breach of protocol - they're not supposed to acknowledge, even in private, that the person of the pharaoh is not the person of Abadar Himself - but it's been a long two days since they first learned from Abadar of a complicated situation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We subsidize all the prediction markets in Aktun," says the pharaoh, who is not actually the person of Abadar Himself but is closer than most mortals come, and doesn't use the 'we' just as an affectation. "There's still the security question." There are reasons that sometimes when there are ongoing wars you don't just subsidize a bunch of public markets.</p>
              <p><br>Fe-Anar, the Pharaoh's father, mutters a phrase in the fast-changing language of the Maelstrom which no one who doesn't talk to proteans at least weekly, or have permanent Tongues, could hope to understand; it translates approximately to 'lol fuck the security question'.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pharaoh has permanent Tongues, and also did not need it to know what his father was going to say there. "One thing We would pay a lot to resolve is 'odds that Osirion and Cheliax end up at war over this," he says sharply, "and I expect Hell would also observe that with fascination. And while We don't find the arguments for squishing anomalies before they change Golarion persuasive, obviously, and are appalled that that's been policy for so many millenia, obviously, We're trading with a lot of entities that do find those concerns persuasive. But really We'd make it all public in Axis, subject to some standard nondisclosure agreements, if it weren't obviously an avenue for interference by Hell."</p>
              <p><br>"They've got to have their own predictions."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Only relevant market public in Hell is the one for the souls of some various adjacent parties, which, uh, keeps getting more expensive, I don't know how to interpret that exactly -"</p>
              <p><br>Fe-Anar mutters a phrase in the fast-changing language of the Maelstrom which translates best to 'fuck Hell'.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Amen," says everyone else, fervently; they keep on top of how the Maelstrom says that one.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><br>"Is there not," says Merenre, "some kind of ordinary Aktun market participation contract understood to be robust against Hell - really I'm astonished that all Aktun market participation contracts aren't understood to be robust against Hell -"</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"They're robust in the sense that if they're fucking around, We'll take their money, in the long run."</p>
              <p><br>"And that long run is measured in - transaction volume? What goes wrong if we just subsidize it."</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That long run is measured in transaction volume and also in time for arbitration courts to make them eat penalty clauses that're still financial in nature -"</p>
              <p><br>"So pay the courts to work inside a time-dilated demiplane. With all earned respect, &nbsp;if this has a one in ten chance of being as important as it looks, you aren't spending enough money on it!"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I literally cannot afford to spend money on ten things like this, so I need some way to figure out which one is going to get me more than a math textbook!"</p>
              <p><br>"The arbitration courts do already run at whatever speed is necessary for them to resolve in the contractually obligatory time. That's a month sidereal, for current events prediction markets," observes a sparkling ball of gears floating above one of the conference-table seats.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><br>"Do they promise they won't speed up and start settling everything overnight?"</p>
              <p><br>"They do not," says the sparkling ball of gears, with what might be faint amusement.<br>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"First prediction market," says the King-Consort. "Pay a hundred top performers in Axis with a share of future returns from the work of Abadar's new cleric, to get up to speed and then predict what'll go wrong if we make the betting open in Axis and try to beat Hell at what is, in the end, our game, more than theirs."</p>
              <p><br>"The future returns from the project aren't ours."</p>
              <p>"The cleric's ours -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The cleric's - so it's not clear he&nbsp;<em>is,&nbsp;</em>is the thing, Abadar's tried to show me what He's looking at but I don't understand it, and I certainly don't know that he considers himself to have entered into a trade relationship with us where we can conditionally commit his resources according to our model of what he'll be willing to pay for later -"</p>
              <p>"A share of future returns from the project conditional on the target agreeing that this market served his interests -"</p>
              <p><br>"Not to harp on this too much, but, all of what was just proposed plus 'inside time-dilation', we're already later to this than I'd like because of the Zon-Kuthon war -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Because of the Zon-Kuthon war We have fewer resources to run bits of Aktun in time-dilation than We'd like."</p>
              <p>"Can you put numbers, when you say things like that, like, precisely how much time-dilation can we have at what multiplier on its usual cost."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I really can't."</p>
              <p>"I mean, give me an order of magnitude -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "If Abadar were able to put orders of magnitude in His visions then We would have so many fewer problems!"</p>
              <p><br>"Proposal: a communication to the target in Cheliax to the effect 'subsidizing prediction market in Aktun, evaluate policy questions relevant to you with promised share project returns, reply yes no"</p>
              <p><br>"Cheliax is we believe committed to not murdering him if in their evaluation he starts to look dangerous to their interests but they're neither above nor prohibited from neglecting to prevent his capture by Nidal. Which isn't to say not to contact him, it might be worth it, it's just to say, I continue to want some way of evaluating these ideas before we try them other than gut instinct."</p>
              <p><br>"Yeah, all right."</p>
              <p>"Market now, contact him in the dead of night if the market thinks it's a good idea, ready to grab him if he decides to leave Cheliax -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have you learned anything from the last two days," says the pharaoh. "We will make absolutely no plans with a twelve-hour time horizon. Who knows which gods will be at war by then."</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>...that means she should also probably take her punishment before she goes back to Keltham, and she's currently in the wrong mental state for it, namely euphoric and full of giddy terror, but she's not actually the out-of-control child Abrogail seems to think, she can talk herself around. She trots over to the temple and contemplates dath ilani Lawful Evil, which they do tell stories about apparently, Evil Keepers who wield the Law for their own benefit. She wants to be that. Cheliax doesn't understand dath ilan but it does understand how to harden Evil in someone's heart, how to turn human weaknesses in so they feed Evil impulses not Good ones. She needs that. And she deserves punishment, because she erred, and doesn't want to blunder through the world unpunished until she faces the ultimate punishment for an error too big to overlook. Asmodeus said to punish her as his Law requires, because otherwise she'll err too far before reality shows up to correct her.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Keltham has her childish, stupid heart, because he's rich and powerful and willing to walk away from Cheliax over her and it's very cute, but Cheliax owns her body and soul, and this is, in the evaluation of a system designed for punishing weakness and building Evil in human hearts, what she needs.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There, that's better. She will just have to not let all that Asmodean conviction be shaken by the sight of Maillol.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>(Maillol has not been informed of what actually happened there, and very very few people in Abrogail Thrune's dominion ever will be.&nbsp; Spreading such gossip about Her Infernal Majestrix, if you are a Security reading Sevar's thoughts, say, <em>is</em> the kind of conduct that gets you turned into a statue, or sent to whatever other fate is your worst realizable fear.)</p>

She doesn't know the heart of whoever's on staff, she doesn't know what they enjoy seeing, it probably doesn't matter very much. The benefits don't derive from the punishment being executed exactly correctly; anything that requires that much finesse can only happen in Hell.

              <summary>Torture details spoilered.</summary>
              <p>It's the second most physically painful experience of her life, and opening Abrogail's gift bag earlier helps a lot to appreciate how much it could be worse.&nbsp; Unlike Abrogail's bag, which is meant to amuse Abrogail to think of it, disciplinary torture is meant to educate and improve the soul and not <em>just</em> be pleasing to Asmodeus.</p>
              <p>They show you what's coming, to let you contemplate your error.&nbsp; They apply it only somewhat painfully at first, so you can still think coherently about your mistake, and fear how much worse it's going to get, and regret, and then they make it worse and worse to drive the behavior firmly out of you, once you've had that chance to fix in your mind what you did wrong and how much you regret it.</p>
              <p>If you want your pain to mean something, if you want to relate productively to your own torture and suffering, Asmodeus's torturers are doing all the right things to make sure you can.&nbsp; At least if you've been sent in for corrective torture, and not this-is-the-fate-you-should-have-feared-and-now-you-have-earned-it torture.</p>
              <p>The Queen's order calls for the corrective sort of torture.&nbsp; It's a good thing that happened before Abrogail became less optimistic about whether Sevar could be salvaged, or more personally annoyed with her.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>It lasts a lot longer. At least Carissa thinks so, she never actually asked how long the bag lasted. This had a duration written neatly on the scroll she turned in. And she's pretty sure it's longer, because her voice is much, much hoarser, and her face much stickier with snot and tears, and she gets <em>tired,&nbsp;</em>in a way she doesn't think she has before, random uninjured muscles screaming about having been tense for so long.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It'll be worse in Hell.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She understands her mistakes better. She won't make them again. There isn't another way to get this result; dath ilan tries to do everything with rewards, but that just builds stunted little Good people who'd <em>go to Abaddon</em> rather than not get their fair share of a deal.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa would never, ever go to Abaddon. If you told her this was all that was left to her forever, more of this, she wouldn't go to Abaddon. She is strong where the people of dath ilan are weak; she can live in worlds they can't.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She hopes someone is reading her mind because she requests healing adequate to conceal signs of injury from Keltham but can't seem to make her mouth move right now.</p>

              <p>...um.</p>
              <p>Should he just - keep doing this.&nbsp; It seems like cheating.&nbsp; It seems a <em>lot</em> like cheating.&nbsp; It seems like the sort of cheating that means nobody ever wants to cofound a startup with you.&nbsp; Carissa just said she was delighted under the truthspell that he did it.&nbsp; You could establish an awful lot of trust that way, modulo the chance that after they saw his first truthspell they were very thoroughly prepared, or maybe prepared before the first truthspell, etcetera, he didn't request Invisibility Purge today.</p>
              <p>The common sense of dath ilan says to, like, think dangerous things through before you do dangerous things, not try to improvise them as you go.&nbsp; Especially when you have two more Truthspells, to use later if needed - shit he should've cast Augury before he tried that, oh well, he'll get used to having magic eventually.</p>
              <p>Is there anything he needs to ask&nbsp;<em>right now...</em></p>
              <p>"I'm not going to be upset if the spell fails here, or if you can't give the answer you wished you could," Keltham says.&nbsp; "Are your self-reports to me, about what you're pretty sure won't hurt you, likely to be accurate?&nbsp; Not honest, <em>accurate.</em>"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>There are some sights you see very rarely in Golarion, and one of those sights is the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus clutching a sheaf of parchments and laughing so hard there are tears in her eyes and she's having to physically lean against the wall and is probably going to hit herself with Lesser Restoration when this is over to make up for how much she isn't breathing and all of these paroxysms are making her stomach physically hurt but none of this matters because Aspexia Rugatonn has now reached the part where Keltham is completely innocently explaining to the Queen of Cheliax that if she doesn't act like a fucking sane person for once in her entire life she will be either unceremoniously removed from the throne or forced to become his girlfriend.<br><br></p>
              <p>That... might not be such a bad idea actually?&nbsp; Though not in <em>that</em> sense, of course.</p>
              <p>It's just that Keltham - for all his headstrongness, his errors, his delusions, his total spoilation and lack of discipline bestowed by his Lawful Good society's insanely permissive upbringing - still in other ways radiates a powerful impression that... well.&nbsp; &nbsp;That he could not only understand Aspexia's notion of 'corrigibility' after three minutes of explanation, but would possibly even invent it all himself the moment he understood what Asmodeus's own problems were like as seen from His perspective.</p>
              <p>They have no idea what dath ilani halfbloods will be like, at this point.&nbsp; But depending on how they turn out, if they can keep half of all that Law and be raised also Evil, it's plausible that the Church of Asmodeus would really, really, and by 'Church of Asmodeus' Aspexia Rugatonn here means 'Aspexia Rugatonn', really, really, <em>really</em> want somebody on the throne of Cheliax who could understand the concept of 'corrigibility'.</p>
              <p>Abrogail Thrune II's compact with Asmodeus says that, while she can bear any number of potential heirs to men of her own choosing, the Church may twice ask of her a father of the Church's own choosing.&nbsp; As for who inherits, that is something that only a compact with Asmodeus can decide.</p>
              <p>The Church hasn't asked that of Abrogail, so far, because there's been no candidate that would be worth the amount of fuss they'd get.&nbsp; Abrogail's compact says that she needs to do it, but the incompetent devil who framed that compact unfortunately did <em>not </em>specify that Abrogail needed to act professional about receiving such a request.&nbsp; Rather a massive oversight, as it turned out, among many others.&nbsp; So far Abrogail has borne no children at all; but this is not a national problem, there are other Thrunes who could compact with Asmodeus.</p>
              <p>Aspexia Rugatonn will have to seriously consider whether she wants to <em>actually </em>do this, or just threaten to do it in order to witness the look on Abrogail's face.&nbsp; Those are the only two options, to be clear, there is no third.</p>
              <p>But first she's going to finish reading.</p>

              <p>The Queen of Cheliax... is superstimulus-level hot the same way as Contessa Lrilatha, but much more dangerously so on account of looking human.&nbsp; Keltham is glad that he knows that magical beauty treatments exist (is <em>that</em> why the plot point of Carissa getting one?) because otherwise his ero-route trope alarms would be blaring even louder.&nbsp; It makes perfect sense that the Queen of Cheliax is absurdly hot, of course she is, she'd be able to afford it in a society with the economicmagic for that; it's not at <em>all</em> inevitably the case that she's going to try to steal Carissa, or that one way or another the two of them <em>will </em>end up fucking no matter how contrived the reason, no, not at all.</p>
              <p>She also looks tired.&nbsp; Exhausted, even.</p>

              <p>Keltham's private thoughts?&nbsp; Exactly the same as what he says aloud; there is no dishonesty in him, no dishonesty at all, when it comes to trade.&nbsp; That's not because he's nice, but because he knows what fairness is and will not lightly brook any departure from it, whether by himself or any other.&nbsp; In that sense, if in very few others, this young man could pass as an ordinary cleric of Abadar.</p>

              <p>It's admirably Evil and would probably count in Pharasma's sight too; though it's pretty obvious Keltham doesn't <em>realize </em>that the wealth he takes away would starve some number of orphans that would otherwise have lived had those taxes been less.&nbsp; Maybe even if he knew, he'd shrug and say that it was still fewer total orphans than would've starved if Keltham had never come to Cheliax; it's not Abrogail's read on him, though.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham's thoughts show sincerity (of course, he's a cleric of Abadar negotiating a trade deal with somebody who hasn't visibly betrayed him yet) and some not especially Golarion-comprehensible thoughts about logarithmic <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">utility-functions</span> if you're spending money on yourself. &nbsp;Abrogail does know what a logarithm is, but the connection in Keltham's thoughts is not clear.</p>
              <p>"If you were willing to take some of your share of the gains in a public investment fund that stayed in Cheliax, it would potentially simplify some political problems for us."&nbsp; And also probably be the sort of thing that's much easier to contractually yoink, if Keltham tries to leave.</p>
              <p>Abrogail does have some thoughts about how Keltham's gains, if he tries to leave, could be made payable to him 'in the standard backing of value for Chelish currency'.&nbsp; The trouble is, that gets caught by that incredibly audacious clause he innocently dared to offer Lrilatha about avoiding terms expected to have unexpected unpleasant consequences.&nbsp; If Keltham's departure leaves behind most of his gains in the form of a Cheliax-only investment fund, if they can get away with including that clear and understood term, it might save Cheliax quite a lot of loss.</p>

              <p>Did she doom herself to 'trope'hood by <em>that</em> not happening in front of Sevar?&nbsp; She doesn't think so; that was a duel between herself and Keltham and not one that was really over possession of Carissa at all.</p>
              <p>Well.&nbsp; Perhaps Sevar's thought was correct, perhaps everyone but her underestimates Keltham; he is doing better than she expected, even now.&nbsp; But at least to Abrogail, it seems like Keltham does flirt very close to the edges of losing his games and damning himself in one sense or another.&nbsp; He just needs to be encouraged to go on playing them.</p>
              <p>The Queen sighs.&nbsp; "I suppose we could have it be - the kind of favors owed that are understood not to be enforceable even in the eyes of Asmodeus?&nbsp; I am a little friendlier to you for borrowing Sevar, you are a little friendlier to me for making you look good in front of her."</p>
              <p>"Maybe what I really want is the acknowledgement that my pride has any value at all, in this.&nbsp; Especially since, as an outsider from a world lost completely to Good, you may not see or realize or understand the Evil thing that you are trampling on and perhaps also trample on it excessively."</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(This will give Carissa Sevar slightly more time to recover; since, it has by now been reported to Abrogail, the cute little idiot went and submitted herself to her any-time-in-three-days torture session right away, without making sure it happened sometime when she'd have an hour or two to herself to recover afterward.&nbsp; Was Sevar that stupid, that overconfident of her recovery ability, or had she just never previously gotten herself in important-project-screwup, mentally-insubordinate-to-the-Queen levels of trouble?&nbsp; Probably all three.</p>
              <p>It is <em>infuriating</em> that the child has gotten herself into a vital position where she needs to be accommodated for incompetence like that, rather than it being turned into a more object lesson.&nbsp; But they're planning to try out Lrilatha running Suggestion on Keltham; and while that is expected to go well, Sevar needs to be in better form to exploit whatever change Keltham has then in his thoughts.)</p>

              <p>Unfortunately Keltham came into this conversation with a clear goal, namely, get his brain into a position to decide whether it was comfortable renting Carissa to the Queen, but with no real idea of how to accomplish that goal.</p>
              <p>...internal interrogation suggests that, on the one hand, their overt interactions have not been very - sexy, doesn't really create any relationship where Keltham rents Carissa to her... oh.&nbsp; In retrospect, maybe <em>that's</em> what the Complicated Flirting was about; it was just that Keltham was much more worried when that happened, about the Queen possibly trying to open her eroLARP route at him, so he shut it down.&nbsp; He was probably not supposed to do that.</p>
              <p>Still, that the Queen flirted (<em>hopefully </em>just pseudo-flirted) at him, at all, is an acknowledgement of Keltham as a sexual-romantic-relationship-having-thing, and that is... possibly enough for whatever weird thing is inside him, Keltham does not understand the rules at all.&nbsp; Well, it's enough <em>provided that</em> the Queen is in fact incredibly hot, which she is.</p>
              <p>But maybe add safety margin?&nbsp; Why do something your brain just barely approves of, when you could do&nbsp;<em>not that.</em></p>
              <p>"I think the dath ilani thing to do in this situation, if it could manage to come up in dath ilan, is that we both tell each other a mildly embarrassing naughty story from our early sexual experiences, in a way meant to acknowledge that the other person's story is sexy and funny, and then we have a relationship that is not just about project management or 'trope' avoidance and my brain is more confident that I can rent Carissa to you."</p>

              <p>- even naive Carissa, who would be experiencing the shock of her life right now, wouldn't be so childish as to let it show on her face. But Keltham is taking these baby steps into deeper Evil for her, for the delight of seeing how she reacts, and she wants to reward him for that, she wants having power over people to be something that he finds endlessly thrilling. And it's not like it embeds everything else in a lie; she can tell him afterwards that she would usually have tried to conceal her shock, but didn't, for him.&nbsp;</p>

              <p><em>And also</em> Keltham's worried about Carissa's heart being stolen away from him - not least by her possible delusion that Carissa's own person could possibly be taken away from him, even by the Queen of Cheliax, if Keltham himself had decided to get serious about keeping her - so he now, as indeed the greater part of his compensation for this rental, demands that before he hands over Carissa, the Queen sign such agreements as will duly incentivize her to attempt no such thing and ensure a correct outcome for her if she does.&nbsp; If by untampered truthspell it is proven that Carissa has come to love the Queen and to love her more than she loves Keltham, then Keltham has the right to walk out on all this shit not withstanding other bargains to be signed later, and haul Carissa's chained-up ass away with him, if he chooses.</p>

              <p>Very standard language; it wouldn't do to include anything hard for Abrogail to check, that she'd have to stop to consider, and give away that such compacts are dangerous in front of Keltham.</p>
              <p>What the very standard language <em>says </em>is 'fuck you, stop messing with Asmodeus's pet outsider unless the Church says you can'.&nbsp; She can't even send him to fake etiquette lessons.&nbsp; That said the legal language in which that 'fuck you' is written is very standard, for Hell.<br><br></p>
              <p>But that's pretty much what Abrogail <em>wants,</em> at this point; and you know what, the etiquette thing would maybe not have actually been a good idea, maybe dath ilan also has an idea that there is more than one kind of flirting.</p>
