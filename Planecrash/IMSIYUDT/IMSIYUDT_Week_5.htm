              <p>(Keltham is not even remotely considering hitting on her; she's busy, and Keltham hasn't proven himself anywhere near that far and knows it.&nbsp; She might also not be of a species that can mate with his, come to think.)</p>
              <p>Keltham tilts his head in a brief but formal dath ilani gesture of acknowledgment, such as would be appropriate for a medium-size business owner greeting a Legislator.&nbsp; Markers in Baseline say that 'Contessa' is her title, not her name, but he has no idea what that title means; it didn't translate.&nbsp; "I'll endeavor to waste your time as little as possible, and apologize in advance for those inevitable wastes of time that will occur anyways due to my profound ignorance of this world and uncalibration over how cautious I need to be.&nbsp; I observe that your physiology is outside of what I know as the human range-of-observed-variation; if your cognitive-psychology is correspondingly outside the human range-of-observed-variation, is there anything I should know about that to make this conversation proceed quickly and effectively?"</p>
              <p>Being able to speak Baseline again is a relief; he can say what he actually means, and <em>not </em>have that come out in enormous long sentences full of enormous words.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham starts dumping his local utility function, step one of expeditious negotiations.&nbsp; "It seems to me in my ignorance that this world is faced with a problem, the Worldwound, which requires of it a superior level of collective competence, on pain of its possible destruction.&nbsp; I have information that will perhaps be helpful for this; should I succeed in conveying such, I wish to capture for myself some small but fair fraction of those gains.&nbsp; I may, then, sell some of my information, of that type which would soon be profitable to its possessor, and perhaps sell it excludably to that possessor alone for as long as it takes to be rediscovered elsewhere."</p>
              <p>"But of the types of information I have in my possession, it seems to me that there is much information which would and should end up disseminated beyond Cheliax even in the short term, having the character of truly basic knowledge that is the foundation of too much else and too much further research, as may need to happen in other places for the Worldwound to be expeditiously defeated.&nbsp; Nor is it likely in the long run that this world shall converge to an equilibrium in which Cheliax alone knows the more advanced equivalents of basic math.&nbsp; Nor is it particularly appealing to me that many people of Golarion in the long run should end up ignorant, even if I gained twice as much money thereby; if I am at all useful and I capture the smallest fraction of the resulting gains, I expect to saturate my uses for money, and so the remainder of my utility is in my concern for the aesthetics of my deeds.&nbsp; Even if Asmodeus deemed it in his interests that Chelish alone know the ways of Law-aspiring thought, a hundred and forty-four years hence, it is not yet obvious to me that this is my own interest in the affair.&nbsp; Then much of the information I have, forming the foundation of that which I wish to sell, is that which should be disseminated; and though it not be sold exclusively, I would yet wish the credit to myself, and to my world which taught me, for the sharing of that knowledge and the benefits it brings.&nbsp; Such gratuities as might be legally due to it, would be due to myself, with middleman's fees to Cheliax only for that part which Cheliax actually played; and such informal gratitude as might be due, would be known to be credited to Keltham of dath ilan, and to Cheliax accurately for whichever role it actually played in conveying that information further."</p>
              <p>"And yet it has been observed to me by Carissa Sevar that I am ignorant of this world and may not understand the consequences of sharing such information.&nbsp; Nor have I the experience to negotiate a lasting contract with confidence.&nbsp; As a hedge against both this folly of mine, and the imperfect overlap of our interests, I had thought to suggest a baseline contract establishing a point of departure and next-best alternative to renegotiated agreement, under which information I share freely with Cheliax must be made available to those factions which presently contribute to the fight at the Worldwound, after a period of one month, known to have come from Keltham of dath ilan with the help of Cheliax; unless that contract is renegotiated before then; with exceptions for such information as may be designated infohazardous by a majority vote of whichever Worldwound-fighting deities, known to be able to speak on the subject, may make their opnions known on that subject.&nbsp; And then if that turns out to be stupid and you can make me see it's stupid, it could be renegotiated before the month was up.&nbsp; This would not be the only contract that needed signing, but it would let me get started on teaching the basic structure of reality and the way of Law-aspiring thought, while I gained the knowledge and confidence to sign other contracts."</p>

              <p>Cheliax lets people in. If they hear we are doing something better than what everyone else is doing, and they come here, or go to a church of Asmodeus somewhere else, and they say they want to come here, or want to learn these things, we would not hesitate to teach them.</p>
              <p>There are a dozen things that I can think of offhand that could go wrong with telling those nations at the Worldwound whatever your procedures are, but to name two representative ones, there are organizations at the Worldwound that do not make and will not keep commitments. There are also organizations that will try but not be very good at it. There isn't a meaningful difference between 'the organizations at the Worldwound get it' and everyone getting it, except in who is getting a head start.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Taldor mostly sends criminals to the Worldwound, to be rid of them, and I think some people there are there for taking part in an effort to overthrow the government of Taldor, and it seems likely that if they were more capable and possessed with a valuable resource they could trade onward there would be a war.</p>
              <p>Aside from that, it's a fine set of people to get a head start if we want to give it to everyone at all, which I am uncertain of. The society you describe is different from ours, in many ways, and it seems possible that the ideas you are describing do not work as the foundation for a society of humans without some other behind the scenes implementation, screening or emergency-response we don't have.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus thinks Cheliax should chance it. But if Cheliax chances it and then it's a terrible idea, Chelish provinces will break off to be independent, or Chelish people will leave for somewhere else. If you do this everywhere, there won't<em> be</em> a somewhere else."</p>

              <p>Also,&nbsp;<em>why must everything in Golarion be such a mess why why why.</em></p>
              <p>Okay.&nbsp; Do they have obvious incentives?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; They have obvious incentives coming out of their ass.&nbsp; They probably do not think Keltham is not supposed to notice this. &nbsp;Lrilatha has met smart people ever and possibly met Asmodeus.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham comes from a world whose fantasy novels developed in such fashion as to not include any tropes under which writing a contract with a devil's ichor would have supernatural effects.&nbsp; Contracts are shadows of the one irreplaceable Algorithm and breaking them might get powerful supernatural beings angry at you for peeing on the Algorithm, but this would be totally unrelated to the ink in which those contracts were written.&nbsp; History has been screened off, and the best-guess shared-false-historical-world fiction that developed afterwards, doesn't include the best-guess that people used to use feathers as pens - that's not a trope either.</p>
              <p>Keltham is staring at this trying to figure out whether she is an artificial organism designed in such fashion that her anatomy just happens to include <em>better pens</em> than could otherwise be supplied on short notice to a Government negotiation in a secure facility.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham takes their scrambling-time as a pause in which to think.&nbsp; It's been a long time, at least by the standards of his total life lived so far, since the very basics were explained to him.&nbsp; Keltham was stupider, then, hopefully stupider than these people are now, because he sure doesn't want to spend years painstakingly teaching all <em>that </em>stuff, with like a dozen dozen dozen carefully composed exercises whose exact details he can't possibly remember unless there's an intelligence-enhancing spell for that.</p>
              <p>Maybe he'll just, like... rapidly state as true, all the things that are true, and see if that just works for most things, before he tries to do anything more difficult than that?&nbsp; In accordance with the classic dath ilani proverb-heuristic which says:&nbsp; <em>Try things the easy way first; if you succeed, you won't need to try them the difficult way; if you fail, you'll know the first part that makes it difficult instead of guessing that in advance.</em></p>
              <p>The proverb itself puts Keltham in mind of the Watchers-of-Children who first spoke the proverb to him.&nbsp; Mostly, of course, children learn from older children, but there are adults who know more to oversee the process, and prevent any <em>semantic drift</em> that might otherwise occur.&nbsp; They are not full-fledged Keepers, those Child-Watchers, but they are in a profession that calls for an oath or three.&nbsp; Children matter a lot, what happens to them is one of the causal lynchpins of everything else that makes Civilization work.&nbsp; And the Watchers who specialize in teaching foundational subjects are those who are selected (among other qualities) for being able to hold very basic truths in reverence, and operate them with joy.</p>
              <p>Keltham is not <em>usually</em> a reverent person, but it has never particularly occurred to him to question the attitudes that his Watchers took towards the deeper truths of reality and thought, when Keltham was a child.</p>
              <p>Keltham remembers, then, how things are taught to children, especially those ideas too important and precise to be entrusted to the teaching of older-children alone; Keltham draws those feelings about himself.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>And Keltham holds forth upon the Way.</p>
              <p>Even when you truly expect and anticipate that something will happen to you, sometimes, something else happens to you instead.&nbsp; "Beliefs" are the name given to those things that control your anticipations; that which gives to you your actual experiences is termed "reality".&nbsp; Sufficiently young children have not yet developed the capability to appreciate that their beliefs, the beliefs of other people, and reality, are three distinct objects of thought; they are not capable of distinguishing between what they know themselves, and what other people know.&nbsp; Comprehending this marks a threshold in what is taught to dath ilani children.&nbsp; Keltham thinks everybody here probably understands that already, so he's going to skip over that threshold and the exercises leading up to it, but people should let him know if this starts being a sticking point.</p>
              <p>Reality possesses both overt order and deeper order; surface appearances, and facts behind them.&nbsp; Deeper order can be obvious or nonobvious.&nbsp; When you observe that Jennith resembles her mother Merwen, you observe a surface seeming; when you say that daughters often resemble mothers in general, you are observing a deeper order.&nbsp; If you could peer at things that were arbitrarily small, like being able to look at a bug as though it were the size of a bird, and smaller yet; and you saw tiny twisting spirals inside Jennith, all carrying the same very long intricate pattern; and you saw that half of those tiny twisting spirals appeared also in Merwen, and the other half of Jennith's spirals had come from her father Eveth, you would have discovered a nonobvious deeper order, something with the promise of explaining the obvious deeper order.&nbsp; Baseline has a separate word by which to speak of the nonobvious deeper order, the <em>hidden order.</em>&nbsp; Behind a hidden order may lie another hidden order.&nbsp; Even when you are not told about a hidden order, even when nobody knows what the hidden order is, it may still exist and be the secret factor that has organized the seeming chaos of the experiences before you.</p>
              <p>The understanding that reality is full of hidden order is the threshold that marks a mind's readiness to apprehend the Lawfulness of reality.&nbsp; Once a child becomes able to distinguish between what they know, and what others know, and what <em>is,</em> that child can soon after apprehend that what seems to them like madness, confusion, noise, or simply a collection of boring unconnected facts, is only the&nbsp;<em>appearance</em> of a collection of unconnected facts, the <em>absence of knowledge</em> of an explanation if one exists; these children are ready to understand that their own bewilderment is their <em>map</em> of the world; and that the territory itself is never feeling bewildered, and that it is often full of hidden orders.</p>
              <p>(It is possible to believe that something is a hidden order, and be wrong about that; maps of hidden orders are not thereby part of the territory, they're just maps of a supposedly deeper part of the territory.&nbsp; Children are led through several exercises meant to help them appreciate this fact on a deep level: that you in your own mind are really impressed with a theory of hidden order is not the <em>same </em>fact as that hidden order actually being present in the territory and able to control your experiences.&nbsp; This has always seemed like a really obvious point to Keltham now that his brain is mature, so he's just going to press on without doing a lot of exercises there, but people should speak up if that's somehow torpedoing the rest of his lecture.)</p>
              <p>It was the way of reality, in the universe that Keltham knew, that complicated things possessed the hidden-order of being made of simpler parts: and in dath ilan, knowledge of this fact was power.&nbsp; He's not <em>quite</em> sure that the same also holds true of Golarion, but Keltham did do some preliminary checks, and was told, for example, that snowflakes have hexagonal symmetry.&nbsp; Keltham knows the hidden order underlying snowflakes in dath ilan, the tiny pieces that nestled together in sixfold symmetry there; so he's guessing that snowflakes have the same hidden order in Golarion.&nbsp; And by extension, that Keltham's own body has the same hidden orders of the same kind rather than having been remade and rewritten on his arrival here.&nbsp; There are a <em>lot</em> of hidden orders invoked within a dath ilani body.&nbsp; It is a further guess, though not a certain one, that Golarion possesses <em>all </em>the same hidden orders of that kind - that the things here that Keltham recognizes, are ultimately made out of the same tiny parts that Keltham knows.</p>
              <p>In Keltham's world, they don't have spells; some of the hidden-orders here must have been absent from Keltham's world.&nbsp; In Keltham's world, when you want to go from one place to another place very far away, you get into a huge metal structure with fixed wings and powerful engines that push out air behind it, thrusting that 'aeroplane' forwards to fly across oceans and continents.&nbsp; To build something like that, you have to understand the hidden orders of metal, in order to build sufficiently strong metal.&nbsp; You have to understand the hidden orders of fire, in order to find dense-enough fuels that burn hot enough for the fuel on board the aeroplane to last for flying across the continent.&nbsp; But these hidden orders are <em>invariant within dath ilan;</em> they work for everyone, not just spellcasters.&nbsp; They aren't truths about the people using the aeroplane, they're truths about metal and fire.&nbsp; For a quarter of a day's income, you can buy a ticket for an aeroplane trip across a pretty large ocean, going slightly less fast than the speed of sound in air, and get to the next continent in a quarter-day or half-day.&nbsp; Keltham is not sure how much it costs to teleport the same distance here, but he gets the impression it is more expensive than that.&nbsp; Artifacts that exploit dath-ilan-style hidden orders can be made <em>without spellcasters.</em>&nbsp; They are <em>economically scalable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>That is part of the change that Keltham hopes to bring to Golarion; and driving back the demons of the Worldwound will only be the bare beginning of its consequences.</p>

              <p>This is the knowledge of the Laws governing attempts to think, which have the character of - wait, Keltham hasn't explained the difference between empirical truths and necessary truths.&nbsp; Does everyone here already happen to know the difference between empirical truths and necessary truths?&nbsp; He's kind of guessing not, based on some previous exchanges about 2 + 2 = 5; if not, he can cover that too.&nbsp; The notion of Validity is as good a place as any to give an example of Laws governing thought.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham goes to the whiteboard and draws some conscious observers inside his blue circle-worlds.&nbsp; Much as some other world might indicate observers with smiley-faces, dath ilani convention calls for Keltham to draw a number of glaring eyes inside his worlds, creating a tableau that somebody from a differently-troped world might regard as eldritch.</p>
              <p>"Well,&nbsp;now I've put some conscious observers inside these worlds!&nbsp; Not that my tiny drawings embody real experiences, of course, they're not detailed enough drawings for that; so now these pictures are no longer being drawn in full detail, which is something we might need to watch out for if this was a more complicated debate about conscious experiences."</p>
              <p>"Some of these observers, in the worlds where Z is actually true, might see twenty triangles being red, and zero triangles being green, and hypothesize a general law: <em>all triangles are red.</em>&nbsp; They might be able to deduce, without having to actually scry into other planes, that Z was not a necessary truth; they might be able to cast illusions, draw on walls, or just use their imaginations to see that.&nbsp; So they would not be&nbsp;<em>certain</em> that all triangles are red.&nbsp; For all they know, the world might up and present them one day with a green triangle.&nbsp; But the next time they saw a triangle, even if their world made them slower to see colors than shapes, they could guess even in advance of observing; they would <em>guess </em>the triangle was red."</p>
              <p>"Let's also suppose that you can tell whether an object is small or large, but it's an&nbsp;<em>expensive</em> measurement; an observer has to actually wander over close to the object, to determine its size; because if they're looking at the object from a distance, they're not sure if it's nearby and small, or large and far away.&nbsp; These observers have only one eye, as you can see; no binocular vision for tracking distances.&nbsp; Let's say they have to pay one labor... one silver piece each time they want to move to an object."</p>
              <p>"In worlds where H is true, observers who pay to measure a few red things will find, that of all the red things they have measured, every one of those red things was large."</p>
              <p>"Now let me ask again, in case anyone has seen the point before I speak it:&nbsp; How can knowing necessary truths save you money?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"To state it precisely, some observers may have guessed the unnecessary truth that all triangles are red, observing the redness after the delay.&nbsp; They may have separately guessed the unnecessary truth that all red things are large, after paying to measure some red things.&nbsp; Maybe they've never measured any of the red things that were triangles! we can suppose for the sake of clarity.&nbsp; Then the&nbsp;<em>necessary</em> truth, 'Q is true in all worlds where Z and H is true', can allow them to guess the unnecessary truth 'All triangles are large', which necessarily follows from other unnecessary truths they've guessed.&nbsp; And even if they've never measured the size of a single triangle before, they can guess - though not know for certain - that every triangle they've seen was large, and that the next triangle they see will be large.&nbsp; If it's the kind of knowledge that matters, but not enough that you need to be very sure of it, they could use that guess in place of paying a silver piece to measure it."</p>
              <p>"Of course, it isn't a&nbsp;<em>necessary</em> truth that the observers are capable of figuring this all out - that they can operate the necessity, 'Z and H yield Q'.&nbsp; We could draw an illusion of a world where the observers totally fail to figure that out.&nbsp; It would still be true across all planes and all illusions that could ever be drawn in full detail, but the people in that illusion wouldn't know it."</p>
              <p>"It isn't necessary that entities successfully operate universal necessities in order to see which new guesses must follow from old guesses, which means that some entities do better or worse at this than others.&nbsp; This is true when considering all possible worlds as a whole, and also happens to be true within my homeworld, and almost certainly in this one."</p>
              <p>"So now we shall turn to the question: suppose you were constructing a new entity from scratch.&nbsp; How would you go about embedding in them an internal reflection of the interuniversal Law, the ability to operate necessary truths correctly...&nbsp; No, sorry, that's probably too much of a leap to ask in one go.&nbsp; Strike that, restart.&nbsp; Suppose you were comparing two entities: how would you say that one was doing better or worse than the other at being Lawful in this exact sense?"</p>

              <p>...it really seems bizarre, that you could teach&nbsp;<em>Law&nbsp;</em>this way, with trick questions and guessing games and strange rules about how you're supposed to volunteer wrong answers if you aren't sure you know the right one. It seems like the habits of mind that would teach are - well, does she actually think that it'd teach un<em>Lawful&nbsp;</em>habits of mind, or just&nbsp;<em>horrendously ill-advised&nbsp;</em>ones, there is a difference -</p>
              <p>- if you built a military out of Kelthams it would not be a very good military, which is a perfectly serviceable definition of Law, the discipline and coordination required to win wars. The Kelthams -- and, plausibly, the people taught like Keltham - would be wrong, a lot, out loud and cheerfully, they'd consider everything their business, they'd ask questions they shouldn't ask -</p>
              <p>- he did behave differently with Contessa Lliratha, maybe there's a kind of distinction the mind can successfully maintain, irreverent in most contexts but deferential where it actually matters - but it seems like it would be hard to tell if someone will be deferential when it actually matters, if they've spent their entire life in contexts where it doesn't, not being sufficiently deferential at all -</p>

              <p>Still, it is Otolmens who calls, and the mortal is more Lawful Neutral than usual even for those that register Lawful Neutral.</p>
              <p>From the mortal's general spiritual posture, Irori can already guess what He'll see.&nbsp; But just in case, Irori expends the energy to take a very brief look at the surface of the mortal's mind.&nbsp; It's not as difficult as it would be at other times of this mortal's life, given his current endeavors.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa feels that she could grasp what Keltham is pointing at a lot faster if she were reading his mind but that's disallowed, now, he's a fourth-circle caster and reasonably likely to notice. She can't even ask him whether it'd be all right if she read his mind because they haven't acknowledged mindreading to be a thing that magic can do.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It remains bizarre, to think that Law has anything to do with formal mathematical logic. You don't need to understand the gods to be Lawful, you just need to obey them. But - but Keltham's world is more Lawful than hers, and -</p>
              <p>- so there's nothing heretical about the claim that humans are using a mediocre approximation of Law, which is a god-concept that doesn't mean quite what humans understand it to mean. And there's nothing heretical about the idea that humans&nbsp;<em>ought&nbsp;</em>to use the real thing, except that they're too stupid and limited to understand it, so they have to settle for their wrong approximations. And there's...nothing&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>heretical about the claim that, actually, there's a way to teach humans the real thing, despite their stupidity and limitations -- at least, to teach smart humans, to teach humans in Keltham's world with a median INT of 16 or 17, and the people in this room have a median INT of 16 or 17, so the people in this room can learn it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And the true structure of Law&nbsp;<em>would&nbsp;</em>be mathematical, because it's about - regularities, consistencies, treaties among the gods aren't<em> promises&nbsp;</em>so much as&nbsp;<em>fundamental changes,&nbsp;</em>becoming the kind of structure of which the promise is true, and there is, actually, an obvious parallel to math there, even if she can't properly articulate it. The way the gods are is inevitable; in many ways they vary much less than humans, because there is only one way to be right and many many ways to be wrong.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And the gods wouldn't be very suited to figure out what math, specifically, to teach to humans, especially if it requires obnoxiously counterintuitive tactics like making everyone limp their way through the lesson<em> guessing -&nbsp;</em>and perhaps, too, this wouldn't even have been worth trying anywhere in the world until quite recently, you need a bunch of smart people in a room and Cheliax is the first society in recorded history to&nbsp;<em>look&nbsp;</em>for all their smart children and&nbsp;<em>teach them math -</em></p>

              <p>"The tactics of algebra - like being allowed to add 3 to both sides of an equation - are meant to&nbsp;<em>preserve</em> truth, not create it from scratch.&nbsp; If an equation starts out true, a tactic in algebra should not produce a false equation from that true equation."</p>
              <p>"This way of thinking holds even if the elements of the equation refer to things in the outside world.&nbsp; Let x be the number of people sitting in the brown chair, 2 as it happens, and let y be the number of people sitting in the red chair, currently 3.&nbsp; It is then an unnecessary truth, not a necessary truth, that x + 1 = y, as I have defined those terms to refer to the outside world.&nbsp; In our world, x + 1 = y evaluates to 3=3, which happens to be true; but if you cast an illusion showing two people sitting in the brown chair and two people sitting in the red chair, the equation in that world would evaluate to 3 = 2, which is false.&nbsp; And if I said x + 10 = y, that would be an unnecessary falsehood; in our world it evaluates to the false statement 12 = 3."</p>
              <p>"Now apply the rules of algebra, add 2 to both sides, and transform the first equation x + 1 = y to the new equation x + 3 = y + 2.&nbsp; In our world, this evaluates to 5 = 5, which is again true.&nbsp; If we apply the same tactic to x + 10 = y, it yields x + 12 = y + 2, which evaluates to 14=5, again false."</p>
              <p>"We term a step of inference&nbsp;<em>valid</em> when it is&nbsp;<em>truth-preserving;</em> when it transforms true statements into only other true statements.&nbsp; It doesn't have to preserve falsehood; multiplying both sides of an equation by zero will produce truth even where it didn't previously exist."</p>
              <p>"What makes the tactic of adding 2 to both sides of an equation, allowed in math, is not that some Watcher or representative from Governance told you it was allowed."&nbsp; This part got hammered into Keltham and his agemates a lot as a kid, so it was probably determined to be important in practice to emphasize??&nbsp; "What makes it an allowed step is that, if you have two weights balanced on either side of a scales, and you add two identical rocks to both the left side and the right side, the scales will still balance after that."</p>
              <p>"If you look back at the original flawed proof that 2=1, it goes from a true statement in step [7], to a false statement in step [8].&nbsp; Then between [7] and [8] we must have applied some operation of inference which is not 'valid', which has the ability to take in a true statement and spit out a false statement.&nbsp; This tactic was canceling the multiplication by (x - y) from both sides, which is to say, dividing both sides by x - y.&nbsp; Dividing both sides of an equation by 2 is valid; if you have a scales in balance, and remove half the weight from each sides of a scale, it will still be in balance.&nbsp; Here, we see that division by 0 is not valid, because it can produce falsehood from truth.&nbsp; What makes division by 0 unlawful is not that your Watcher told you not to do it while doing algebra; it is that division by 0 is not generally truth-preserving.&nbsp; We can find some equations that will still be true after dividing both sides by a term equal to 0, but it is not a safe step in <em>general.</em>"</p>
              <p>"Sorry if that part about Watchers seems overly obvious, by the way.&nbsp; It's just that apparently human brains by default try to reuse the part of ourselves that learns from adults not to steal cookies outside of mealtimes or we'll get slapped on the wrist, in order to relate to the rules for manipulating necessary truths that existed outside the start of Time.&nbsp; And these are actually quite different topics; like, rules change sometimes, when Legislators vote on them, but algebra doesn't.&nbsp; So you want to be explicitly aware of the difference, and not go bugging adults to let you divide by zero just this once."</p>

              <p>It makes sense, though. Mortals didn't have free will. Now they do, and it displeases Asmodeus, but no one has a complete account of what free will is, because they're not gods, and don't understand what exactly displeases Asmodeus. But that might just be it. Gods, innately, reason in truth-preserving ways. Of course they would. Lying to yourself for self-preservation is a thing you only have to do if you have wrong beliefs and can't argue yourself out of them because you don't know the counterarguments, and so you have to stop thinking about them. That is not a problem gods have. Gods just reason correctly. And in Keltham's world - there's still the concept of infohazards, things you're not supposed to learn, presumably because you're only human and can't properly have the kind of mind that entertains that fact in a way that allows for continued useful functioning -</p>
              <p>- something about that frame isn't quite right but despite that she feels like everything is coming together.</p>
              <p>Minds should reason in truth-preserving ways. Someone, a long time ago, robbed humans of that, and Asmodeus is angry. Carissa is angry! That was her birthright, and she wants it back. And Asmodeus thought, until Keltham arrived, that the scars they'd wrought on human souls could only be corrected in Hell - or at least could most cheaply for Asmodeus be corrected in Hell - but in Keltham's world, where humans do not magically reason in truth-preserving ways, they figured out, possibly over many thousands of years of careful experiments, how to teach it. And Asmodeus saw that and immediately told them not to hurt Keltham, because -</p>
              <p>- okay, that line of thought she's going to tuck away for later, it seems maybe ill-advised. Sufficient that Keltham got Asmodeus's endorsement immediately.</p>
              <p>Minds should reason in truth-preserving ways. The books ought to have good arguments. Devils are masters of propaganda, but aren't convinced by it. Carissa - doesn't think of herself as convinced by it, the books are really presenting their conclusions not their arguments, but - but that's because the books think humans aren't doing reasoning well enough to be persuaded by argument, and humans can learn that. At least smart ones. And if they knew it, then you could just argue everyone out of all the heresies, their minds wouldn't possess the weaknesses that make that strategy doomed, that make it necessary to present them with conclusions they won't be able to understand. Or at least - less of it. Keltham did have the concept of things he was not meant to learn.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(More things that suddenly make sense: what the Starstone does to you, why it changes some people more than others. Godhood, even more than devilhood, would preserve you to the extent that you are worth preserving - to the extent that you have learned the processes of reasoning - Irori ascended just by becoming perfect, and everyone writes that off as a strange one-off that only Irori could do but in dath ilan they&nbsp;<em>teach&nbsp;</em>it -)</p>
              <p><br>It has to be done all at once, she realizes. There's a terrible middle ground where you are trying to reason things out, but you are incompetent to do it, and so you run right into all the heresies that you could have been protected from by not trying to reason. You would absolutely fail a loyalty check, in the&nbsp;<em>middle&nbsp;</em>of trying to learn how to think. But at the end of it - Asmodeus arrived at His beliefs through reason. And He hates it, that humans were changed, so they can't, and He wants them changed back.</p>
              <p>She rereads everything on the board, though there's not much written on the board. The new thing she's learned here isn't that there are necessary truths and empirical truths, or that you shouldn't divide by zero, it's that <em>it is possible for humans to learn how to reason well enough they're better off trying it.</em></p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"When it comes to algebra over continuous quantities," Keltham says, gesturing at the tactics written between the steps of the equations, "we have rules like being allowed to multiply both sides by the same quantity, or divide both sides by the same quantity so long as it isn't zero.&nbsp; If you imagine building a mind to reason inside a universe that was full of hidden order that could be described by algebra - if it was an observer surrounded by, like, piles of fruit containing twice as many cherries as apples, that sort of thing, it was just how that world worked - then you could imagine building that mind with rules like, 'If I believe an equation, I should also believe that equation with both sides multiplied by the same quantity' or 'If I believe an equation, I can believe that equation with both sides divided by the same quantity, so long as I already believe that quantity isn't zero.'&nbsp; I say this to introduce a new topic: the concept of <em>hidden order within the</em><em>&nbsp;rules of reasoning themselves</em>.<em> &nbsp;</em>There are hidden patterns and deep explanations to be found in this subject matter, as, in my world, there was a reason why snowflakes had sixfold symmetry."</p>
              <p>"As a very simple example, the rule 'You can divide by nonzero quantities' can be seen as a pure special case of 'You can multiply by any quantity.'&nbsp; To say you can divide both sides by 2 is the same as saying you can multiply both sides by 1/2.&nbsp; The reason you can't divide both sides by zero is that zero is the only continuous quantity which lacks an inverse.&nbsp; Once you see things from that angle, in fact, you might say that it's a simpler viewpoint to say that there's just&nbsp;<em>one</em> rule to use there, about valid inference in algebra: the rule that you can multiply both sides by any quantity.&nbsp; Say just that, and you don't need that darned rule with the extra complication about 'Oh well you can divide by anything&nbsp;<em>unless</em> it might be zero.'&nbsp; You just have the rule that you can multiply by anything, and the rule that everything except zero has an inverse.&nbsp; You <em>could </em>also add the rule about division, nothing invalid would happen to you if you did, but it would be redundant; the mind you were constructing could reach the same conclusions either way.&nbsp; Through perceiving hidden order in the rules of reasoning, you would be able to simplify the mind's thought processes and arrive to the same ends - though it might also take longer to reason that way, it might take extra steps if you eliminated the extra rule."</p>
              <p>"But meanwhile, back in the real world, we deal more with the equivalent of triangles and red things than the equivalent of numbers and addition.&nbsp; I mean, this world has both, but still, let's go back to shapes and colors and sizes.&nbsp; What sort of truth-preserving rules analogous to 'you can multiply both sides by any quantity' in algebra, might we use to combine beliefs like these?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa is being a bad student. This is, in part, because she is no longer in school and no longer feels with aching intensity that the entirety of her being as a person is her perfomance in school, and being lashed for inattentiveness doesn't hold the soul-consuming horror it once did either. It is in part because her mind keeps running ahead - she can't always see the answers to the specific questions, and probably she should focus her attention on them at some point, to crystalize the skill of turning all her thoughts into the crisp precise symbolic bounded versions of them, but she can see the broad outlines of what the questions let you do. Everything, maybe, if you're a god. If you're a human -&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>How would you express 'the best outcome a human can reasonably get is to live such that when they die and go to Hell, they are useful?' For all humans - but no, she's not really making a claim about all humans, she's really only interested in the implications of this question for one human, and the other ones are relevant because she knows exactly how exceptional she is - there exists a human, such that, in the space of all eternities for that human, ordered by how strongly preferred they are, the most preferred is - well, no, it wouldn't be Hell, because of all&nbsp;<em>possible&nbsp;</em>eternities there are certainly some better ones -</p>
              <p>This is of course not an argument against Hell, it's not like she could formulate any other important claims about the world either. It is an argument against sucking at thinking. It is an argument for - if there&nbsp;<em>were&nbsp;</em>a book that tried to convince you, what would it&nbsp;<em>say -</em></p>

              <p>In that last bit of improvised whiteboard, Keltham extends his last equation, and then writes down one more on the edge of the wall below:</p>
              <p><em>\h. blue(h) \/ red(h)&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;???&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;\h. ~red(h) -&gt; blue(h)&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp; \h. ~(~blue(h) /\ ~red(h))<br>\h. blue(h) /\ red(h)&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;\h. ~(~red(h) \/ ~blue(h))&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;~(red(h) -&gt; ~blue(h))</em></p>
              <p>"Now, given that - if you have 'not' - you can make 'and' out of 'or', or make 'or' out of 'and', or make either one out of 'materially implies' - why not just design an entity that thinks in terms of implication?&nbsp; Why bother making an entity that tends to think in terms of 'P is true or R is true', instead of 'if P is false then R is true'?&nbsp; This is not a theoretical question: if your mind works anything like mine does,&nbsp;<em>your</em> mind sometimes thinks in terms of 'or' and not just 'implies'.&nbsp; You've probably thought using 'and' too.&nbsp; Why is a human mind - which includes <em>your </em>mind - designed so... inelegantly?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Actually, there's something of a questionable assumption I've been making, which is that your biology is a possibly-modified version of biology that got copied off of a... branch of time, I don't think Taldane has a word for it... that's very close in branching time to dath ilan.&nbsp; I think dath ilan can't see your world, can't be affected by it; but I did manage to show up in this world at all, even if that's a very rare phenomenon.&nbsp; So your world <em>can</em> see my world, be causally affected by it, even if my materializing like this very rarely happens. &nbsp;And your bodies look a lot like mine, and more importantly, I can eat your food without immediately falling over dead, which implies a <em>lot</em> of shared hidden order between our biology, which wouldn't exist without common ancestry.&nbsp; If it's possible for me and somebody from this world to have kids, which is mostly what I'd expect, that would absolutely prove the point."</p>
              <p>"Where the point is that while some stuff may have&nbsp;<em>modified</em> you relative to where a dath ilani starts, and dath ilan may have developed and diverged some from whenever your biology was copied from our cousin or ancestral world - remind me of how old human life on Golarion is, again? - human biology on Golarion is, I would strongly guess, basically a copy of dath ilani biology.&nbsp; Some of my distant ancestors or cousins got materialized here and had kids, maybe.&nbsp; Or some god read the - heredity code - for one of us and materialized some entities like that."</p>
              <p>"If all of that is true, then the reason your underlying mind design looks like it was slapped together by monkeys on drugs, is the same reason <em>our</em> baseline mind design looks like it was slapped together by monkeys on drugs.&nbsp; I wasn't born like this,&nbsp;<em>we</em> have to give people&nbsp;<em>extensive training</em> to get them to work at all correctly, instead of them just <em>working correctly straight out of the womb,</em> the way we would if we were designed by&nbsp;<em>sane designers</em> instead of... well, the thing that actually made us.&nbsp; A weird pseudo-nonentity that had&nbsp;<em>literally</em> no idea what the ass it was doing.&nbsp; Frankly it's sort of a big topic here, though it sure is a fundamental one so I'll probably get to the details at some time.&nbsp; The point is, I fully expect that by the time we're done in class here, you will be looking over your mind design and thinking that you could accidentally sneeze a better mind design than that.&nbsp; I'm not quite sure what the 'given free will' thing was about, the Taldane term 'free will' doesn't translate well into Baseline so we may not have whatever you were given, but trust me, your species's mind design was horrible crap even <em>before</em> then.&nbsp; You can tell this because I had to go through lessons similar to what you're going through now.&nbsp; Though, if 'free will' makes you even <em>worse</em> at sanity, which sure is plausible given this total mess of a planet, I probably need to have that explained to me at some point... I don't suppose it's easy to describe?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Yeah, I'm not going to say details like that are unimportant, they're obviously hugely important and at some point I want to know everything that's known about it, but they're not obviously <em>urgent</em> details, especially compared to the general project of me transferring knowledge Golarion will need for industrialization and scaling up to fight the Worldwound."</p>
              <p>"So&nbsp;back to where your mind design actually comes from.&nbsp; I'll endeavor to be brief because this lesson is mainly about Validity, but now we're talking about how shards and reflections of Validity even got into human minds at all, and soon we're going to ask whether there's maybe something <em>better</em> than the version of Validity we have; and I'm not sure how you could reason well about those topics if you had no idea where your mind design came from in the first place."</p>
              <p>"This part is actually a pretty simple idea.&nbsp; If anything you should be careful not to overthink it.&nbsp; You know how a pair of tall parents will probably, though not always, have a kid who's taller than average?&nbsp; And a pair of short parents will probably, though not always, have a kid who's shorter than average?&nbsp; It may help for the sake of concreteness to know that inside you there are <em>extremely</em> tiny, extremely <em>long</em> spirals of... stuff Taldane doesn't have a name for, but capable of encoding information.&nbsp; Like, imagine there's four kinds of tiny parts that can make up each bit of spiral, labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3; so a section of the spiral might read 1032, that is, it'd be the second kind of bit, connected to the first kind of bit, connected to the fourth kind of bit, connected to the third kind of bit.&nbsp; Each spiral is around three billion of those units long, but the parts are so tiny that even three billion of them curled up in spirals are still too tiny to see.&nbsp; Your body is full of identical copies of your version, and it carries the information that told your body how to develop fingers and toes and a liver and so on, when you were forming in your mother's womb.&nbsp; Variations in that code, between individuals, might cause some to grow up taller and some to grow up shorter.&nbsp; You got half of your spiral sections - they're broken up into twenty-three pairs of sections - from your father, and half from your mother, which is why a pair of taller parents will tend to have taller kids."</p>
              <p>"Now suppose that taller parents tend to have&nbsp;<em>more</em> kids than shorter parents.&nbsp; Then the next generation will end up taller than the previous generation; the variations in codes that tell bodies to construct taller bodies will be more common among the next generation's inner spirals."</p>
              <p>"Pile on one change after another, after another, after another, that contributes to some couples having more kids than another.&nbsp; Even though each change is a single alteration, if you iterate that process thousands of times, millions of times, it can build whole complicated parts.&nbsp; But it builds them without foresight, without planning.&nbsp; Every part of your body is made up of a cumulation of changes that started as <em>copying errors</em> in the tiny spirals; they're mistakes that happened to work.&nbsp; That's also where your mind design comes from - from the copying errors, and from some of those copying errors leading parents to have fewer kids and those errors dying out of the population, and a few copying errors accidentally constructing people who had&nbsp;<em>more</em> kids and those variations spreading throughout the population.&nbsp; If I was actually focusing on this topic properly, I'd sketch the design of an eyeball on the wall, and show how it can develop in tiny changes starting from a single light-sensitive spot on the forehead of some tiny crawling creature a hundred million years ago."</p>
              <p>"For now, the key thing to know - going back to our actual current subject, Validity - is that your mind design&nbsp;<em>accreted on</em> the ability to think using 'and', and the ability to think using 'or', and the ability to think about stuff implying other stuff, and the ability to imagine facts being true about all the objects inside a collection.&nbsp; It's not all quite as redundant as it looks - the human native ability to reason about 'or' isn't quite the 'or' that appears in very simple logic, we're more likely to say an object is 'red or blue' meaning that it's either one or the other but not both, and less likely to say that this table is 'brown or not green', considering that in fact it is both brown <em>and</em> not green.&nbsp; We are, in teaching ourselves to reason using the sharper simpler forms of logic, repurposing bits of our mind away from their original contexts, and stripping off real functionality along the way.&nbsp; But that's part of the story of why we have such redundant facilities for thinking logically, 'and' and 'or' and 'implies' all at the same time."</p>
              <p>"So would you like to guess, now, as to whether I'm about to tell you about some new connectors that would let your mind expand to even more powerful ideas - represent ideas that native human concepts can't represent at all?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"When I was a bit younger and learning this stuff for the first time, I went straight to the Watcher - the adult who was there to make sure the older kids weren't teaching us anything too wrong - and demanded that I immediately be taught the&nbsp;<em>most powerful</em> kind of logic there was.&nbsp; The Watcher told me that the logic I was learning was the most powerful kind of logic on offer - that it was, in fact, the most powerful kind of logic that <em>could</em> exist.&nbsp; I didn't see how anyone could possibly know that even if it was true, so I figured this was another of the lies-they-tell-children, or maybe that the best kind of logic was probably being kept secret by the Keepers.&nbsp; Those being the people who <em>would</em> learn a more powerful kind of logic, if it existed, and was too dangerous for everybody to have.&nbsp; I wanted that for myself, so I tried inventing other kinds of logic with <em>more powerful&nbsp;</em>symbols in it, symbols that could connect&nbsp;<em>three</em> or even&nbsp;<em>four&nbsp;</em>propositions together, instead of just the one-or-two symbol connectors the older kids were telling me about."</p>
              <p>"But before I tell you about the results of that particular journey of thinking, and whether or not it did turn out to be a lie-they-tell-children in the end, let me pause and ask another question first.&nbsp; In algebra we have rules for producing new equations from old equations, or combining old equations.&nbsp; Here we have rules for producing new statements from old statements, if those statements are written in a particular language.&nbsp; Both algebra and the statement-rules obey the higher principle of Validity - we have ways of comparing equations and statements to worlds, to see if they're true or false; and if an equation or statement is true in a world, the rules for manipulating it should produce only more true equations or true statements.&nbsp; In the world of statements, we managed to reduce 'or' to 'and' and 'not'.&nbsp; In the world of algebra, we reduced the rule 'divide both sides by a nonzero quantity' to 'multiply both sides by an inverse'.&nbsp; Can we in some way combine the rules of algebra, and the rules of statements, since they are both born of the same truth-preserving principle?&nbsp; Can we reduce algebra-rules to statement-rules, or reduce statement-rules to algebra-rules, and so simplify our mastery of truth-perservation?"</p>
              <p>"This one's actually quite hard to solve from scratch at our intelligence level - I didn't get it as a kid and wouldn't expect myself to get it now, if I didn't already know it.&nbsp; But it is important to know your own emptiness before trying to fill yourself, so go and speak aloud any really bad wrong answers you come up with here."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"If you take the hint now, you'll never know whether or not you <em>needed </em>a hint or just more time... but we're trying to industrialize a planet and that's probably more important than you ever knowing whether you could have punched above your measured intelligence level and discovered the deeper orders of Validity from scratch, so, yeah, hint.&nbsp; You <em>cannot</em> build 'add one' out of <em>only</em> and, not, implies, for all.&nbsp; I previously showed you a system that had&nbsp;<em>predicates</em> like 'blue' and 'red', which took in the kind of object that 'forall' quantifies over, and spat out truth or falsehood depending on whether the object was red or not.&nbsp; There's no way to build 'add one' out of only those materials, because 'add one' takes in an object, a number, and spits out <em>another </em>object."</p>
              <p>"This doesn't mean your system has to start out knowing what add-one means.&nbsp; It does mean that you're going to have to conjure up an add-one symbol that maps objects to objects, and then start&nbsp;<em>describing</em> what it means.&nbsp; But that description needs to talk about add-one as a hypothetical function whose properties will be described, not build it purely out of the predicate symbols and logical connectors.&nbsp; You are also going to need a symbol '=' for equality between two objects; that one is usually assumed primitive - that even if the system starts out knowing nothing else about the objects it describes, it knows how to tell when two objects are equal.&nbsp; '=' takes in two objects, and spits out truth or falsehood."</p>
              <p>"There's a more sophisticated trick you can pull to not need to introduce a special symbol for add-one - roughly, you say,&nbsp;<em>for all functions from objects to objects, if that function has these properties, this stuff follows&nbsp;</em>- but that would involve quantifying over functions, which we can skip for now.&nbsp; So, to reiterate:&nbsp; You get to conjure the&nbsp;<em>symbol</em> for add-one from nowhere; you get to declare by fiat and premise that it takes in an object and spits out an object; you don't, however, get to assume that it has any behaviors beyond that, or means anything in particular, except for whatever statements you make using the add-one symbol.&nbsp; Same for two-object functions like add, or multiply.&nbsp; You can declare that there's a plus symbol, and that it takes in two objects and spits out a third object, but anything about <em>which</em> objects has to be described by you, and that's what makes the symbols meaningful."</p>

              <p>And then he drops on them the infinite axiom schema for induction, trying as best he can to explain why you'd need it to pinpoint the numbers.</p>
              <p>After clearing up any misapprehensions about that as best he can, Keltham is ready to move on to his next point.</p>
              <p>"We're running through things a lot faster than I went through them as a kid, and I'm probably accidentally leaving out important ideas along the way - all of this would take more like a month, if you were eight years old and doing the exercises, even if you were doing nothing else.&nbsp; But you may recall that some time earlier, I posed some puzzles about asking for examples of necessary truths, and why they were ever good for anything, and what it <em>means</em> to say that one equals one is a necessary truth - what you ought to expect to see happen as a result - especially given that a necessary truth should still end up being true no matter what happens to you, if it could happen inside any illusion depicted in full detail."</p>
              <p>"We now have a language in which I can give some of my own answers there.&nbsp; But before then, does anybody want to take a renewed shot at saying what it is we're talking about, and what we should expect to see happen, if we say that one equals one is a necessary truth?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham does not have the sharpness of unaided vision, let alone interpretation capacity, that would be required to perceive these nigh-imperceptible squirms.&nbsp; He lives in a mental universe very far away from this reality, a mental universe where uncomfortable or unhappy students will of course speak up and tell you this fact as soon as they realize it themselves.&nbsp; Though he <em>has</em> noticed his researchers' apparent lack of any visible emotions besides competitive enthusiasm, and is starting to wonder if they used a magical spell that's the equivalent of a mind-affecting drug that made them fixedly enthusiastic.</p>
              <p>Well, at least this time he's about to say some words where enthusiasm seems appropriate.&nbsp; Keltham tries to channel the demeanor of an appropriately specialized Watcher as best he can; the sort of Watcher who tries to make sure that kids get the full impact of things, and aren't cheated out of awesome stuff by older kids mistakenly trying to act like it's no big deal.</p>
              <p>"In my language, we'd say that the&nbsp;subject matter of our discussion, when we talk about math, is&nbsp;<em>which conclusions follow from which premises.</em>&nbsp; When we discuss numbers and say 2 + 3 = 5, it implies that <em>if </em>we observe cherries and come to believe that our number-axioms describe <em>in reality</em> the operations of combining bowls of cherries, we will expect to see in reality that pouring a bowl of two cherries into a bowl of three cherries yields a bowl of five cherries.&nbsp; If we get six cherries instead, we might think we made a mistake in the math.&nbsp; Or we might suspect that watching the bowl closely would let us see an extra cherry popping into existence.&nbsp; In the latter case our beliefs about <em>which conclusions validly follow from the addition-premises</em> would have been right, but our&nbsp;<em>guess that the addition-premises applied to combining bowls of cherries</em> would have been wrong.&nbsp; Being the fragile creatures that we are, and sometimes making mistakes in our reasoning, when we do math about a bridge and then the bridge falls down, we might be observing that the bridge disobeyed the premises about which we did math; <em>or </em>we might be observing that we made an error about what was a necessary connection, and our conclusion didn't follow even though all the premises were true."</p>
              <p>"All of this is to say that we can observe the consequences, the shadows, of necessary truths, when we watch the empirical world; even to the point of our observations leading us to suspect errors in our own reasoning about what was necessary.&nbsp; But observing the number 1 itself?&nbsp; At best, maybe, somebody could make an illusion of an object representing zero, not the successor of any other object, connected by a successor relationship to the object that would therefore be one," and Keltham draws some green dots connected by red arrows to other dots.&nbsp; "This would give us an illusion that would map very directly, in our external interpretation, onto a partial model that fits the number axioms.&nbsp; But it doesn't make sense to say that the illusion is depicting <em>the</em> number one; there isn't a single thingy like that out there floating in the void, just a set of premises that actually existent things might obey, in which case we'd expect them to behave like the number one."</p>
              <p>"The facts about&nbsp;<em>which conclusions follow inevitably from which premises </em>can't be said to be older than the temporal universe, because they're outside of time entirely; it's not that they existed before the universe began, or that they'll last after the universe perishes, but that they are somewhere above or below that.&nbsp; Temporal and physical processes draw on necessities, mirror them, but cannot change them between one time and another.&nbsp; There's a certain sense in which, in controlling our own decisions, we are controlling links between premises and conclusions - we are controlling, given the premise of a person like ourselves, the conclusion of which decision we come to - but this doesn't mean we are <em>changing</em> mathematical facts between one time and another.&nbsp; An alternate plane of existence - or so I would suspect - can obey different <em>premises</em> in its physical behavior; it cannot alter which conclusions follow necessarily from which premises.&nbsp; Those facts are, not eternal, but outside of time entirely.&nbsp; This is one of the ideas invoked by a word in my language, which translates into your word 'Lawful': the concept of drawing on and mirroring the level of existence where certain facts may be viewed as absolute and unalterable."</p>
              <p>"You have seen now how we can start with two apparently different concepts of validity - one that preserves truths about properties of objects connected by 'and' or 'implies', one that produces true numerical equations from true equations - and, at least for the case of whole numbers, reduced the equational subject matter to the predicate-logic subject matter.&nbsp; Just like we were able to reduce 'and' to 'or', or 'or' to 'implies'.&nbsp; I will tell you now a point that you will not be ready to prove yourselves for a while: the system of predicate logic I've introduced to you is one of several systems that are complete in the sense that <em>all</em> mathematics can be translated into them.&nbsp; The topology you learned as wizards, unless it deals with some phenomenon absolutely foreign to dath ilan whose mere existence refutes this entire philosophy - which I am <em>mostly</em> not expecting, to be clear - is just another kind of math that could be translated into this system, or translated into several other systems I haven't shown you, all of which could&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>be translated into this system, and into which this system could also translate, moving between them as freely as we rewrite an 'implies' connector as an 'or' connector."</p>
              <p>"This is one reason I could pop into another dimension and expect to have a reasonable conversation with Lrilatha, who belongs to a species that doesn't exist in my world.&nbsp; If different formulations of validity can so freely translate between each other, it would seem more reasonable to hope that I, to the extent I had those concepts right, would use a version mappable to Lrilatha's, who is a Lawful being; so that her arguments would make sense to me, and my arguments make sense to her.&nbsp; Either a conclusion follows with necessity from its premises or it does not. &nbsp;Only mistakes about that subject matter could differ between people, between factions, between planes.&nbsp; The right answer is the same everywhere.&nbsp; And this is also part of the concept in my language, which the translation spell translates into your word 'Lawful'."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>It is probably optimistic to, before she has even properly learned this herself, conclude that Cheliax could be teaching it so much better, but - Cheliax could be teaching this so much better that it suddenly hurts to realize how badly she learned it before.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There is a right way to be. Devils are it; mortals aren't. Mortals were, for a while, at least controlled by gods, who are, but the control broke, and now mortals just wander around, missing the concepts that make up the right way to be, for the most part not smart enough to learn them. Cheliax emphasizes - that this is disappointing to Asmodeus, that it makes mortals less valuable to Asmodeus, and of course that's the angle from which Asmodeus cares about it, but the angle from which the&nbsp;<em>humans&nbsp;</em>ought to care about it is that they are&nbsp;<em>worse.&nbsp;</em>It is in their interests to be perfected, not because&nbsp;<em>some&nbsp;</em>god will get them when they die and the other gods waste even more of them, but because there is a commonality among all perfect beings, a shared language that the perfect can speak across planes, across time -<br><br></p>
              <p>How is it that Chelish children learn they'll be perfected and are scared, instead of learning they'll be perfected and are <em>joyful, impatient,&nbsp;</em>full of the longing that filled Carissa when Contessa Lrilatha spoke -&nbsp;<em>why aren't we teaching it like this -&nbsp;</em>but the answer of course must be that Asmodeus couldn't divine the result of thousands of years of experiments across an entire other world, at least not more cheaply than He could grab someone from there -&nbsp;</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham pauses, at least partially to catch his own mental breath.&nbsp; He should probably call a break sometime soon, but he was working around to a point, some time earlier before the whole digression into Validity and first-order arithmetic, and he feels like it would be only polite to actually finish the digression and work around to what he meant to say, before then.&nbsp; There's still some distance left to go before he can pop the stack - he wasn't actually expecting, on some wordless level, that it would take this long to teach grown teenagers first-order logic and how to axiomatize arithmetic.</p>
              <p>"In saying all this, I'm jumping ahead in a dath ilani education and skipping over a number of exercises required to actually understand everything and a dozen dozen precautions we were given against common mistakes, some of which now seem pretty silly and obvious to me, but which might turn out to be a lot more necessary to otherwise unprepared minds, I don't know."</p>
              <p>"For example, if somebody throws a ball and you need to catch it, trying to translate your thoughts into predicate logic about the ball having the property of flying and this implying an eventual fall given gravity, is going to <em>utterly</em> fail to help you.&nbsp; You would be, first of all, better off thinking in your mind's native wordless language that tries to visualize the ball's fall and run to there, because your native language is&nbsp;<em>faster</em> and the ball will fall before you can think of anything logical.&nbsp; You would, second of all, be engaging in a particularly naive kind of jumping ahead of your real capabilities, by trying to translate your thoughts about the ball directly into a logic with a falling predicate.&nbsp; What you would actually need to predict the ball's fall using serious math is calculus, and not simple calculus either; it would include terms like how the resistance of the air to the ball's flight changed with the ball's speed.&nbsp; If you try to summarize all that by saying that the 'falling' predicate on the ball was true, when that 'falling' statement would be equally true if gravity was pulling on the ball a different amount or if the air was more resistant, you're throwing away details that actually matter in order to try to squeeze down the issue into predicate logic - an amount of predicate logic that <em>you</em> find easy to handle, which is too little to actually solve the problem.&nbsp; You also wouldn't be absolutely certain about the ball's position or trajectory, and managing uncertainty inside of mathematics is a whole separate topic I haven't broached to you."</p>
              <p>"Actually solving the ball's flight using a full written-on-paper account of how conclusions about what's probably true, follow necessarily from some unnecessary premises you already believe about what's probably true, would require setting up a <em>complicated </em>problem in calculus and probability that would describe how to infer the ball's trajectory from what your eyes had seen of the ball.&nbsp; And if you wanted that said in pure logic with all premises spelled out, you'd have to axiomatize that calculus problem into the more universal language of logic.&nbsp; It is a <em>whole</em> lot easier to just run and catch the ball by thinking about it in your native brain's native style."</p>
              <p>"I mean, maybe if you were a god you could solve the whole problem using explicitly valid reasoning - or not, I'm not sure how mentally powerful your gods are, exactly.&nbsp; And if you were a god and you could do that, then you could get tossed into another plane of existence where gravity works differently, and rapidly recalculate how to catch flying balls from scratch and do that successfully on your first try, instead of having to relearn the rules your brain uses through a lot of trying and failing.&nbsp; But I am not a god, yet, and you are not gods, also possibly yet, and I doubt that any intelligence headbands we can afford in the foreseeable future will let us do it either."</p>
              <p>"So don't get ahead of yourselves just because logic is absolute, timeless, and universal.&nbsp; If you can't think fast enough to solve a problem using explicit logic, or if it would require humanly unmanageable huge problem statements even in principle, or if you simply don't know how, then all that absolute and timeless stuff won't help you.&nbsp; The fact there exists a better method that gods or super-gods could use to solve a problem doesn't mean that you can solve it that way, or that you can get closer to the super-god's solution by using bad, clownlike, and tiny imitations of the outer forms of the ideal methods they'd use."&nbsp; Gods seem like a surprisingly useful metaphor for ideal cognitive processes, now that he's in a world that has gods; Keltham is a little surprised it wasn't a more common explanatory metaphor used in dath ilan.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if any of you actually needed me to say that, to be clear.&nbsp; But it's the sort of thing they tell you when you're 8 years old, and you get into your head the idea that if logic is so great, you should be able to use it to crush your opponents at sportsball by making only sharply logical muscle movements.&nbsp; I mean, actually they just let me make the mistake and lose the sportsball game, but then afterwards, that was what they told me when I asked what I'd been doing wrong and how to do it correctly."</p>

              <p>"If you start with a logical language that already has 'implies', you can add on the new connector, 'or', and then though you've made the statements a little easier for humans to understand, you haven't made the language any more expressive - your new innovation 'or' turns out to be reducible to the same old 'implies' combined with 'not'.&nbsp; After trying out a number of innovations of this type, you might repeatedly find that you were unable to extend the real power of your language, and so venture a guess - a <em>guess</em> based on mere past experience, like seeing that every triangle tested was a red triangle - that you had reached some natural limit of logic's power."</p>
              <p>"But when I asked my Watchers as a child, they did not tell me, 'We're guessing this logical system is as good as it gets.'&nbsp; They told me, 'This logic you are learning is the most powerful form of logic that can exist.'&nbsp; The Watchers where I come from are trained by Keepers and entrusted with the teaching of children; they are not there to set a poor example by just making stuff up, nor by taking great blatant invalid leaps, nor by saying with certainty what they have no right to be certain of.&nbsp; It's not something that gods told us, either; there's no gods where I come from, remember.&nbsp; So how did my Watchers know - what could they possibly have known - how could they possibly have obtained a piece of knowledge like that?&nbsp; I do not expect you to guess this correctly, I couldn't have done that without being told; but I'd like somebody to say out loud a wrong answer; for it's easier to fill yourself with knowledge after you've explicitly noticed yourself not being already full."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>It continues to be disorienting to Keltham each time his audience of empirical-topologists throws around guesses built out of much more mathematically sophisticated language than you would associate with a dath ilani kid too young to know how 'p -&gt; q' was defined.</p>
              <p>"That's about the most plausible wrong guess I can imagine, so congratulations on that.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; They didn't tell me right away why they knew, that time, the Watchers left it mysterious so I'd have some motivation to learn stuff myself.&nbsp; And I apologize if I'm correspondingly wrecking your own education's most optimal ideal form under ideal circumstances, but we have a planet to industrialize, so I'm going to plow ahead anyways and just tell you, maybe someday your kids will learn it the right way.&nbsp; What my Watchers secretly knew was a <em>completeness</em> or <em>idealness</em> proof, built from more powerful and sophisticated methods I wouldn't be ready to use myself until late in age 12.&nbsp; They defined the most you could possibly reasonably ask for out of a logic, then proved they already had that."</p>
              <p>"Consider again our worlds of blue circles, containing red triangles and green squares, and objects related by successorship and multiplication and all the rest.&nbsp; We have said that the subject matter of logic is necessary connections from premises to conclusions.&nbsp; Then the perfect or ideal logic would be one which, given some collection of premises, could derive through its permitted steps of inference <em>every possible</em> conclusion which&nbsp;<em>actually</em> followed from those premises."</p>
              <p>"Well, with some fairly high-powered techniques, you can prove that first-order logic does in fact have this property - which means that if you created a new logic which is a <em>single sentence </em>more productive, in the sense that it says even <em>one more thing</em> follows from a premise set, which the logic I showed you cannot derive through its allowed steps, that new logic is making <em>non-truth-preserving </em>leaps; there will be some model, some world, where all the premises are true, but that extra derived conclusion is false."</p>
              <p>"The key to that proof, incidentally - I sort of feel like I ought to say this, both to give you some hope that such a proof actually exists, and to make reconstructing all this reasoning easier, if it turns out that the food here is poisonous to me after all and it gets too expensive to keep resurrecting me - is a&nbsp;<em>compactness</em> proof.&nbsp; Oh, nice, you have a word for that, so I'm guessing you used a similar concept in topology?&nbsp; The compactness proof shows that if an infinite set of logical statements has <em>no</em> semantic model - if there is no depictable world or illusion in which all the premises are true - then some finite subset of those statements has no model.&nbsp; We further prove that if a finite collection of statements has no semantic model, we can syntactically prove a contradiction from those statements in a finite number of steps.&nbsp; Then if Q follows from a collection of premises in every possible model of those premises, we can adjoin ~Q as an additional premise to the collection, yielding a collection of premises which has no models; and obtain a contradiction in finitely many syntactic steps; and from this by double negation we can syntactically prove Q in finitely many steps.&nbsp; So whenever Q follows from a collection of premises, we can prove it from those premises syntactically."</p>
              <p>"That's the final reason I expected Lrilatha and myself to reason in ways that were not quite so different, even though she wasn't human and possibly hung out with gods.&nbsp; Assuming the whole dath ilani philosophy was true across all planes - though I wasn't quite certain of that, and I'm still not - it wouldn't be surprising if Lrilatha could see some conclusions following from premises <em>faster</em> than I could.&nbsp; But it would be surprising - considering the proof that logic is literally as good as it possibly gets and gives us everything we could possibly want - if Lrilatha could make premise-conclusion leaps of a qualitatively different kind that I could not follow even in principle, using new rules of deduction and permissible derivation that no dath ilani had ever encountered."</p>
              <p>"That said, if you introduce the ability to directly quantify over functions or predicates, the proof I described no longer works, but most philosophers of mathematics in dath ilan claim that this can't really be improving the power of the logic, because anything you can actually derive in the syntax of a 'second-order' logic that quantifies over functions, can also be derived inside some corresponding 'first-order' system that doesn't, like this one doesn't.&nbsp; I mention it because I'm now in some totally other plane and ought properly to be less sure of some things than I was yesterday, and if Asmodeus <em>does</em> show up using genuinely valid reasoning I can't follow even in principle, there'd be an obvious immediate guess that he was taking advantage of physical principles that don't exist in my universe but let him directly access the semantics of quantifications over predicates.&nbsp; We were pretty sure that was physically impossible inside our own universe, but this plane might or might not be another story.&nbsp; But, again, I am <em>mostly</em> not expecting that to be the case, and if Lrilatha could do that, she politely didn't do it around me."</p>
              <p>"That's the final piece of the concept that 'Lawful' translates into my language - the ability of human beings, even if it's only a little, even if they have to struggle and work hard at it and often it's just faster to run and catch the ball instead of overthinking it - to sometimes know and make a more deliberate use of Laws that are timeless, universal, and even, sometimes, <em>knowably optimal.</em>"</p>
              <p>"And that's why I heard that Lawful was a god-concept and thought to myself, 'Heh, I bet I know where that's pointing to on at least some things.'&nbsp; There are, in at least some parts of the Law, a single best way you can possibly do it, and then you can't do any better than that.&nbsp; There may be <em>more</em> aspects to god-thought that I can't understand at all, for all that I presently know.&nbsp; But if Validity is a part of the god-concept of Lawfulness at all, then I can take a pretty good guess at which version of Validity the gods are using, which rules they use to decide which arguments follow from which arguments.&nbsp; Namely, any one that's inside the huge equivalence class of possible rules that allow deriving all the consequences of the premises you have, but not deriving any more than that."</p>
              <p>"To be clear, I just popped into another dimension, I am guessing at some things rather quickly, I could be very wrong about all of this, and any more Lawful beings around are welcome to show up and tell me so before I mislead the lot of you any further.&nbsp; I do think I have enough dignity not to take offense at being told I made some wrong guesses within my first two days of materializing in another world."</p>
              <p>"But it <em>is</em> the obvious thing to suspect, when somebody tells you that 'Lawfulness' is a god-concept.&nbsp; One at once suspects that the gods and smarter Lawful beings will be using forms of the Law that are optimal within certain dimensions - in some cases where I already know which kind of optimality to look for, and that it isn't a very impossible kind of optimality to have, if your brain isn't as completely messy as a human one."</p>

              <p>She is uncomfortably aware that none of those previous steps were valid reasoning. She thinks maybe she needs some practice at compartmentalizing so she can do well in logic class and not be aware of the validity of her reasoning all the time while she's trying to catch flying balls.

            <div class='post-content'><p>"And remember again - it's not that humans contain nothing of Validity.&nbsp; You have concepts like 'or', and 'and'.&nbsp; You have, in fact, more concepts than you need in order to make first-order logic complete, and some of them are redundant.&nbsp; The human problem is not so much what we can never manage to derive in infinite time, as that we are too slow, and, even more than that, we tend to derive an awful lot of stuff that&nbsp;<em>doesn't</em> follow.&nbsp; In dath ilan the Very Serious People used to complain a lot about how we were all being terrible at this, and I used to think of myself as being willing to pursue even riskier and wilder lines of reasoning than that, but now that I've read a book in Cheliax it really puts a lot of that into perspective."</p>
              <p>"But I digress.&nbsp; Humans contain shards, pieces, of the higher mathematical structure we call Validity, the content of necessity, the rules governing premises and conclusions, whose optimal answer is pinpointed by the completeness theorem.&nbsp; Without these shards of Law, humans couldn't function at all.&nbsp; These shards of Law within us are not manifested in a centralized single engine whose voice we sometimes ignore; rather, there are bits and pieces and shadows and correlates of Validity, glommed onto us by mistakes retained in the tiny spirals specifying the starting biology of our brains.&nbsp; It's not that there's a perfect engine of Validity inside us that's corrupted.&nbsp; It's not even that the parts of the perfect engine are distributed here and there inside us.&nbsp; The human versions of logical concepts like our version of 'or' - often implying exclusive-orness, which isn't the logical version I showed you, but sometimes not being exclusive either - are more like weird shadows or correlates of pieces of Law.&nbsp; Same goes for the human native version of 'Z implies Q'.&nbsp; In the human version it feels stranger to say that 'if I'm naked, that implies I'm wearing a shirt' is extremely true about me because I'm not naked and I am wearing a shirt.&nbsp; You can make logic <em>out of</em> the human pieces."</p>
              <p>"But for all that the human pieces were sloppily thrown together, it's no coincidence that you can make a valid logic out of them.&nbsp; Generation after generation, for millions of years, there were slight advantages in reproduction to the ancestors of humanity, who we call hominids, when they could do a better job of deducing unseen truths from the truths they already knew or guessed.&nbsp; The human versions of 'and' and 'or' and 'implies' were built into us in order to do jobs including that job.&nbsp; And because there is only a single complete structure of Validity in the realm of math - because there is a Law and a best Law and it's not that hard a Law to find - all the bits and pieces of Validity that made their way into us, could have enough coherence and overlap in their messiness that a shadow of true Law could be born inside them."</p>
              <p>"Validity is not the only principle with messy shards embedded into humans, in whose overlap and coherence the shadow of higher Law can be seen.&nbsp; Another such principle is the one my people name Expected Utility, singled out as a unique answer by what we call <em>coherence theorems.</em>&nbsp; If yesterday you trade two apples for twenty cherries, and then tomorrow you trade twenty cherries for one apple, you've gone around in a circle and ended up with fewer resources than you had when you started.&nbsp; This is the bare start of a gesture in the direction of proofs that say, 'If you do a lot of deals with apples and cherries in ways that inconsistently value them relative to each other, you'll end up with strictly fewer of both apples and cherries than you could've had by doing different deals.'&nbsp; If I'm rolling a die that must show either an even or an odd number, you'd be foolish to buy for eight silver pieces a gambling-ticket that pays seven silver pieces if the die shows an odd number, and six silver pieces if the die shows an even number.&nbsp; This is the bare start of a gesture at the proof that, when you weight the probability of paths through time inside your mind, you should not weight a sub-possibility of a path more highly than you weight its whole."</p>
              <p>"The principle of Expected Utility has indeed a sub-principle, which we call Probability, with rules and coherences of its own.&nbsp; You may have noticed that a great number of conclusions that we need in everyday life do not follow with <em>necessity</em> from any facts that we are highly confident about; but there are also proofs about the best guesses you can extract from a state of uncertainty, and how you cannot do better than those without adding more data or more certainty into your premises."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Validity, Probability, Utility. &nbsp;Things being more or less likely, encountering new evidence and revising old beliefs, deriving the consequences of what we already know, wanting things, making plans. &nbsp;It's not so much that humans have bits and pieces of the Laws glommed onto us, as that the shadow of those Laws within us explains, in a certain sense, why we function at all - why we can do even the little that we can do.&nbsp; One of my pending questions about Golarion is whether Chaotic gods are still, like, mostly Lawful on a deep level and are just pursuing surface goals that are about humans behaving chaotically in social situations, or something like that, because otherwise I have a hard time imagining what it means to be a god, or intelligent, if your nature is contradictory to all Law. &nbsp;The partial coherence that exists in the noisy bits of Law embedded in us, creating somewhat larger shadows of bigger pieces of Law, is what lets us form larger thoughts that make enough sense for us to ever figure out anything.&nbsp; That all these bits and pieces of Law are bits and pieces of this <em>larger coherent thing</em> is part of the story behind how we can put together the human versions of 'or' and 'implies' and make larger useful thoughts out of them. &nbsp;If Chaotic gods don't have that much Law embedded inside them, if they reject every bit and shard of Validity because it's Lawful, and therefore never think 'I guess that either Z or H will happen', I can't begin to imagine how a Chaotic god would work.&nbsp; Which is one of the reasons why I wonder whether the concept 'Lawful' is translating correctly for me after all."</p>
              <p>"But that's me being confused about this world, which is not our present priority."</p>
              <p>"Our present priority is the industrialization of Golarion."</p>
              <p>"And the reason I say all of this to you, is to make a certain point about our most important tool for doing that."</p>
              <p>"Our path will be relatively simpler, easier, more direct - though still not easy - if a lot of the particular hidden orders I remember about dath ilani steel and dath ilani biology are also true here, albeit with some new hidden orders about magic that were not in dath ilan."</p>
              <p>"But if that isn't true?&nbsp; If snowflakes have six sides here for other reasons?&nbsp; If my body was remade anew in Golarion so that I could eat the food?"</p>
              <p>"Then the valuable knowledge I have to teach you will be the knowledge of how to <em>discover </em>hidden orders. &nbsp;And this knowledge in dath ilan is said to be attained by using and operating shadows of Law that are purer, cleaner, more complete, than humans just throwing themselves at a problem with their own instincts. &nbsp;The explicit math is mostly reified Probability, but the internal mental challenges are mostly those of being a little more Valid in which conclusions we jump to and which assumptions we mark as necessary."</p>
              <p>"I am a lot more confident that Validity, Probability, and Utility are still singled-out mathematical structures whose fragmented shards and overlapping shadows hold power in Golarion, than I am confident that I already know why snowflakes here have sixfold symmetry. &nbsp;And I wanted to make that clear before I said too much about the hidden orders of reality out of dath ilan - that even if the things I am saying are entirely wrong about Golarion, that kind of specific knowledge is not the most important knowledge I have to teach. &nbsp;I have gone into this little digression about Validity and timelessness and optimality, in order to give you some specific reason to think that - even if the stranger proves to have no idea how Golarion is ordered - <em>some </em>of the knowledge he has to teach is sufficiently general that you have <em>strong reason for strong hope</em> that it will work in Golarion nonetheless.</p>
              <p>"My memory is not perfect, and I was never a specialist in metal and fire. &nbsp;To industrialize Golarion, what we must primarily use is not the recipes of dath ilan and its knowledge of hidden orders, for those I do not all have with me, even if they would work here. &nbsp;What we need to do is operate the principles of thought and investigation, by which dath ilan found the hidden orders and recipes that worked in dath ilan; and, with those interplanar shards of Law, find the hidden orders and recipes that work in Golarion. &nbsp;If I can accurately remember some of the recipes and hidden orders from dath ilan, and they prove to carry over here, I expect that will give a rather substantial boost compared to starting from scratch. &nbsp;But I also expect that it cannot carry the day unless we do a little, or rather a lot, of saner thinking of our own."</p>
              <p>"It is said also in dath ilan that there is a final great principle of Law, less beautiful in its mathematics than the first three, but also quite important in practice; it goes by the name Coordination, and deals with agents simultaneously acting in such fashion to all get more of what they wanted than if they acted separately.&nbsp; Here, too, I considered myself relatively wild in this regard, compared to dath ilani standard, but that was before I came to Golarion and read about what all y'all were getting up to around here.&nbsp; I expect I will have something to say on Coordination too, at some point or another."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Not the question Keltham was expecting, but Okay Fine.</p>
              <p>"I'd guess the smartest, the most careful - we have a specialized term for that as a usually-mostly-stable quality of a person, maybe 'conscientiousness' would be the best translation here?&nbsp; I expect they'd look for things you can test in childhood that somebody has shown to correlate with keeping oaths in adulthood later and being very unlikely to go unstable under stress.&nbsp; I mean, the real answer to your question is that we have prediction markets, people betting on outcomes, with which a lot of people betting, operates as a kind of summary of everyone's best guess at the probabilities of definite observations being made later.&nbsp; And, I would strongly expect, the Keepers have secret prediction markets that <em>only </em>Keeper institutions can bet on, because it's a secret <em>what </em>exactly they're betting on, because they don't want parents pushing their kids into faking their way into joining the Keepers.&nbsp; But I imagine the secret prediction market topics say, is this person going to end up passing the following competence tests, will they end up measurably mastering the Way that Keepers keep, will it be recorded that any spilled secrets get traced back to them, will they ever be observed to have broken an oath they took.&nbsp; Are they going to get along with other Keepers the right amount, neither too conforming nor too iconoclastic.&nbsp; Will they end up being promoted, are they going to report enjoying their work and be happy at it in observable ways... now that I say it out loud, I feel like there's probably more in the secret markets than that.&nbsp; That's the kind of market you run to find out if a kid is going to be a good matchmaker or doctor, not to find out who ought to be a Keeper.&nbsp; The thing is, prediction markets are ultimately betting markets and they have to resolve in definite observations at some point.&nbsp; So there's some sort of observable thing that would happen to you over the course of your career as a Keeper that a bet would have to be about, in order for it to ever pay out.&nbsp; In terms of your local system - I don't quite know if they'd qualify as 'Good', they do get paid for what they do, in both money and reputation, but they definitely lean further Good than average - they are, in the end, spending their lives taking care of other people."</p>
              <p>"I've always felt weird about the aspect where Keepers are significantly more Good than I am, to be frank.&nbsp; Even if you nod respectfully at them and pay a tiny fraction of their salaries, they're still doing you this huge favor, that you didn't ask for - <em>some</em> of which probably has to be done in order to make society livable for you at all - but they're doing <em>more</em> of it than I'd ask for, if it was up to me - supposedly on my behalf.&nbsp; And they aren't doing it <em>wrong,</em> that I know about, or hurting me in any way, that I know about.&nbsp; But they're still doing more of what they do, than I'd have really asked for... though I'm not a typical dath ilani, the typical dath ilani probably feels more on median-average like there's the right amount of Keepering going on.&nbsp; Though actually, by the nature of their jobs, there's got to be <em>more </em>of it going on than we really know a specific reason for?&nbsp; So some reasons for the Keepers' existences are hidden, and maybe my own first-impression feelings are closer to average and I'm just failing to adjust for predictable updates on the hidden info if I could see it... the whole Keeper thing is probably one of the objectively weirder institutions in dath ilan from an outside viewpoint, along with the Surreptitious Head Removers, the Official Government Con Artists, and the Planetary Emergency Rehearsal Festivals.&nbsp; All of which have completely logical and reasonable reasons behind them, and are still understood and acknowledged even by Civilization generally to be some of the weirder things they have talked themselves into doing."</p>
              <p>"Though, I mean, I don't disagree with the reasons, I can see why something like the Keepers need to exist.&nbsp; Very stable geniuses can extensively develop thoughts that will wreck less stable people's minds, often without them even meaning to do that.&nbsp; Even pursuing Lawfulness too far can sometimes end up that way.&nbsp; Human beings are not designed to work great when we push ourselves harder and harder in the direction of Lawfulness - I mean, we're not <em>designed</em> at all, but I doubt it's something our distant ancestors bred themselves to be able to do safely.&nbsp; I imagine that Keepers are people who by nature are smart and resilient and exceptionally stable in the face of internal insult, able to tolerate weird stuff going on inside or outside their own heads, and what they spend that internal resilience on is going way further in the direction of Law than their ancestors a million years earlier were pseudo-designed to do."</p>
              <p>"And, I mean, I'm sure the Keepers have got a pretty good idea about who can do that by age ten.&nbsp; But that's not because <em>I </em>could take one glance at a ten-year-old and figure out who'd be a good Keeper.&nbsp; It's because, I confidently predict, the Keepers observe a <em>lot</em> of facts about ten-year-olds, and they keep excellent records of long-term outcomes, and they train people with very high measured intelligence to make good predictions about it.&nbsp; Come to think, I wouldn't be surprised if the Keepers had a secret prediction market about <em>me</em> somewhere in their systems, saying exactly what my chances were of succeeding at my life goals, and people like me aren't told those predictions because that's exactly the kind of information that - can be a bit - <em>more Lawfulness</em>&nbsp;than we're really happy having in our lives.&nbsp; And if you can predict that actually a kid is going to be totally okay with knowing that information, then maybe you try to make them a Keeper.&nbsp; Or maybe what they predict isn't so much kids starting out imperturbable, as that you'll end up driven to face down whatever kind of internal bumps you face, in order to be able to face any kind of disturbing truth and not allow your potential to be limited by the disorder of your own mind... I don't know.&nbsp; I didn't want to be a Keeper.&nbsp; They weren't the kind of weird I wanted to be."</p>
