            <p>And then Keltham runs out of ability to speak.&nbsp; There's an almost painful wrenching at his heart, a sudden manifestation of the reverence and faith that a dath ilani feels when watching a personnel launch to the Moon base, but stronger than Keltham has ever felt it, <em>this is the dream, what Civilization wants to be when it grows up,&nbsp;</em>only something beyond that, something that only appears in science fiction movies, because dath ilan knows with high probability that <a href="https://grabbyaliens.com/">they won't run into any aliens for another half to two billion years</a>.&nbsp; But if that wasn't true, if somehow it wasn't true and the explanation for why the aliens hadn't already appeared, wasn't anything bad, if somehow the aliens <em>weren't </em>already as unimaginably advanced as dath ilan will be in another hundred million years, but only equals, then this would be that place, the dream, a symbol that can't exist, of dozens of species existing together in peace.</p>
            <p>And - commerce.</p>
            <p>He doesn't know how he knows, that the flying gondolae were&nbsp;<em>bought</em> and not just given away, but he knows it.&nbsp; It's not because they couldn't make enough to give away, but because people doing things to benefit one another and be benefited in return is something holy in itself, to them.</p>
            <p>It lasts a very long, very short time, and then it ends.</p>

I dislike their efforts to build a society where everyone is Lawful Evil and goes to Hell because it is better for everyone to live in a society in which most people are Good. Asmodeus makes decisions based on what Asmodeus wants rather than what's best for all sentients, and while Asmodeus mostly wants desirable things like prosperity and invention and peace, Good often believes his decisions wrong from a perspective concerned with everybody. For example, He doesn't care enough about shutting down Abaddon or stopping Zon Kuthon."</p>

            <p>But there was a purpose of oracles of old.&nbsp; They cannot receive arbitrary messages from gods.&nbsp; They can receive presentiments, under negotiated conditions meant to ensure that those presentiments help to bring about Prophecy rather than avert it.</p>
            <p>Prophecy is shattered now, which is to say, depending on how you look at it -</p>
            <p>- Nethys now knows more than anyone else about how the future is otherwise destined to go, so, if anybody was supposed to still go around sending presentiments to oracles, it would be His job, wouldn't it?</p>
            <p>Nethys does have any options for conveying information to humans.&nbsp; They're just difficult and expensive and not the sort of thing that parts of Nethys can do on a whim, there has to be more power and unity behind it than Nethys usually tries to muster.&nbsp; Difficult, expensive, painful.&nbsp; It's rare for that much of Nethys to agree on anything.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There's more to it than that, of course, Zon-Kuthon is not that easy to manipulate. &nbsp;Zon-Kuthon was somewhat on the fence about Nethys's strange request and stranger warning - He doesn't do what other gods want of Him, usually, but Nethys went more legible than was usual for Nethys and seemed to show knowledge about how the mortal, who admittedly looks rather strange, was likely to oppose Zon-Kuthon's own purposes and have the power to do that for some reason? &nbsp;That the mortal is in Cheliax is also not a good sign; Asmodeus is foremost among the gods who would actually choose to annihilate Zon-Kuthon and not just dislike Him. &nbsp;Zon-Kuthon ordered a strike team assembled, targeted, held ready, but has not given them the go sign.</p>
            <p>Zon-Kuthon is likewise aware that Otolmens is as wary of Him as of any god save Nethys. &nbsp;Dou-Bral once fought to seal Rovagug. &nbsp;Even if the expected balance of pain and pleasure and things that Zon-Kuthon now cares about, changed when Dou-Bral Himself changed to Zon-Kuthon and changed His expected effects on the world, one would expect Zon-Kuthon to be a lot closer to unleashing Rovagug than most other gods.</p>
            <p>The latest attempt at Otolmens telling Zon-Kuthon what not to do is sufficient to swing His decision, especially given that Zon-Kuthon does not expect to be caught.</p>
            <p>He orders the recipient of His vision to tell the team to attack immediately, and then to kill himself, without mentioning to anyone else that this was a fresh divine intervention rather than a previously given order.&nbsp; There's a closing opportunity window here, since if the strike team arrives fast enough, the belief of other gods should be that it was already in motion when the edict was laid.&nbsp; It's very unlikely anyone will see Him about it; any god trying to pay that much attention to all of Nidal would fragment themselves and drive themselves irrevocably mad.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Gorum, Chaotic Neutral god of battle, god of strength and weapons and soldiers, receives a message from a certain Someone who He is rather fonder of, than She is of Gorum.&nbsp; This is only to be expected, given that Her workings often conduce to His purposes; His workings, to Hers, not so much.<br><br></p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; She offers Him information, under the condition that She wishes it not revealed to other gods that She was the source of that information.<br><br></p>
            <p>Gorum accepts.&nbsp; He does not expect to be harmed by the mere reception of information however suspicious, He could always choose to ignore it and do nothing with it.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Zon-Kuthon is about to violate Otolmens's order in Pharasma's Name.&nbsp; If you look exactly here, you should be able to catch Him at it.</em></p>
            <p><br>Interesting.&nbsp; Yes, there it is.&nbsp;<em> What of it?&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon is not as opposed to My purpose as to those of others.</em></p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Zon-Kuthon has not much margin in His tolerance of the expected future state of Golarion.&nbsp; If nothing else is done about it, He is likely to attempt to release Rovagug during an upcoming major disruption to the world.</em></p>
            <p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; As much as You might have wished to use Zon-Kuthon as a counterbalance to Asmodeus, and have been among the foremost proponents of that, events have now been set in motion such that it is no longer safe to try to use Zon-Kuthon for that purpose.&nbsp; He cannot be allowed to remain as He is now.</em></p>
            <p><br>Part of the goddess speaking to Him goes legible; She is being truthful, though it is also clear that She is withholding much, for She does not likewise make legible that She is sharing all relevant information.</p>
            <p>Some of the shape of the connivance is becoming clear to Him.&nbsp; <em>Would this upcoming major disruption be any of Your own work, perhaps?</em></p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Perhaps.&nbsp; If it were, I would wish to conceal My hand and show it to few other gods, with this exception made to reduce the probability of a foreseeable outcome where the world ends up destroyed.</em></p>
            <p><br>Gorum knows He's being used, of course, but it does not offend Him as it might offend other gods; a soldier is a soldier whether they die for another's profit or their own.&nbsp; There is only one question He asks.&nbsp; <em>Will there be battle and bloodshed?</em></p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Deaths shall come faster than Golarion has seen in an age.</em></p>
            <p><br>Gorum will go along with this, then.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>By then Carissa will be there! Spells are nice but the best way to kill someone when you're flying is to drop rocks on their head. She doesn't have rocks but she can cancel the Fly, which is sort of the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You'd think that dropping out of the sky on someone would hurt you as badly as them, which is not a good tradeoff when you're outnumbered, but 1) it's possible for even a random civilian to survive a fall from 60 feet if they let their legs break the fall, whereas it's less possible to survive the same force landing on your skull and 2) she has a healing spell almost finished as she lands, which means she's back on her feet faster, which means shortly after that it doesn't matter if the original injuries would've been fatal or not because Carissa can pull the sword out of Pilar's chest and stab him until they definitely are.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Cheliax has reinforcements teleporting in, by now, outside the Forbiddance. There are enough spells flying that all you can see are streaks of light and all you can hear are explosions and occasional screams.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Does this dead guy have, like, a dagger, in addition to the ridiculous ornamental sword, Carissa super does not have the strength to wield the sword effectively.</p>

            <p>He lands on top of the Kuthites about to attack Keltham without that significantly slowing his massive clawed feet from striking the ground.&nbsp; "Stay near me," he speaks in low rumbling Baseline, words that Carissa can probably recognize by now as dath ilani in intonation, even if she doesn't know the meaning.&nbsp; Then Gorthoklek begins speaking spellwords, and from him spring scorching rays, quickened fireballs, a meteor swarm.</p>

            <p>He shows them the evidence of Zon-Kuthon, in fact, specifically instructing His people, directly after Otolmens's order, to violate Her edict in Pharasma's Name.</p>
            <p>Gorum has been persuaded.</p>

            <p>If such a thing is to be done, and it does appear it might be necessary, it should be done at once and unanimously, because a day of war Golarion can withstand, but a fight that would last any longer than that will flood the crops in the fields and destroy the people and, down the line, the kingdoms relying on them.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Iomedae has considered, long ago, how this could be done. At the time it did not seem wise, and She has been apprised little of whatever prompted so many gods to change their calculations, but here is how it would be done, if sufficient resources are committed to the doing.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And if it is to be done She should hold the key, obviously, as a Lawful god opposed to Asmodeus (let's be honest,&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>Lawful god opposed to Asmodeus), and one who can be predicted to release Him under conditions satisfactory to everyone else save Asmodeus, whose awful conduct is of course the reason they've even been pressed to this dilemma.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p><br>...there is <em>clearly </em>plotting going on here, gods are not stupid, Gorum did not come across this information by coincidence.</p>
            <p>That Nethys <em>could </em>have given it to Gorum is almost too obvious to need thinking; but you can't go around blaming Nethys for everything, that's a way to miss all the other possibilities that aren't "Nethys did it".&nbsp; Also, contributing information leading to the downfall of another god, even Zon-Kuthon, would be pretty daring for Nethys; other gods are <em>aware</em> that Nethys could do more than the usual damage if Nethys started acting deliberately against other gods, and while Nethys might be able to get away with moving against Zon-Kuthon, out of all the gods,&nbsp;<em>once,</em> He'd be walking very thin ice after that, if He were ever found out.</p>
            <p>A plot between Gorum and Asmodeus??&nbsp; Some weird accommodation between them???</p>
            <p>Gods' minds are large enough to explicitly consider many possible hypotheses.&nbsp; They will consider the possibility that it was Somebody Else who made an accommodation with Asmodeus, and then successfully persuaded Gorum to turn against Zon-Kuthon using this information.&nbsp; They will consider the possibility that Zon-Kuthon was lured into doing this and that is why Gorum knew where to look to collect the evidence.</p>
            <p>It doesn't change the fact that Zon-Kuthon did in fact deliberately violate a Pharasma's-Name edict from Otolmens.&nbsp; This is kind of a big deal for any god, let alone Zon-Kuthon, who maliciously withdrew His powers from the Star Towers that Dou-Bral used to impale and weaken Rovagug within Its prison.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodeus is confused, and dislikes it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Those are inadequate words for the experience of being Asmodeus; words are generally inadequate for it, but those ones especially so. All of Caina grows colder, as Asmodeus withdraws His power from Hell in order to think; few ever enter or leave Nessus, and there is no word of what is happening there.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It obviously serves Him, for Zon Kuthon to be warred with, and locked away; it's why He bothered to vaguely insinuate this might be warranted. And it does seem like Zon Kuthon might be more willing to war with Asmodeus - not even for any clear reason! - than previously imagined, which makes the case for being rid of Him stronger.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But this was orchestrated, unambiguously, maybe by Nethys, maybe by several gods collaborating (Iomedae and Irori? Sarenrae and Abadar and Cayden Cailean, who has been <em>intervening in Cheliax&nbsp;</em>for some not-known reason? A minor god, gambling everything?) and it is hard to imagine that the end towards which it was orchestrated was simply the removal of Zon Kuthon.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There's lots of minor things that could be attained in the short term by distracting Asmodeus with a war with Zon Kuthon. Cheliax will be drawn into a war with Nidal. Ground might be lost at the Worldwound. Perhaps a difficult province in Cheliax could break free.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It seems unlikely that a god made a move with these stakes for that practically trivial prize.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Asmodeus is confused, and dislikes it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And yet, when confused, it's better to have more resources than fewer, and it's better for Zon Kuthon to be gone.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>He indicates willingness to back imprisonment of Zon Kuthon, with more resources if the key goes to Gorum. And He'd like Iomedae to note that absolutely none of the recent nonsense is his fault; he's intervened only when fully paid by other gods, to direct his people in not harming mortals They got suddenly attached to.</p>

            <p>And most of the other gods of Golarion assault Zon-Kuthon, everywhere that is <em>not </em>that vault; Zon-Kuthon must put the greater parts of Himself within it, or else be vastly diminished.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Security made its stand protecting the library, and all the girls who could get to it in time - for lack of anything particularly <em>better </em>to protect, once they realized Keltham wasn't on the premises; might as well try to save Cheliax the cost of a few Raise Dead spells that Keltham would probably insist upon.&nbsp; The surviving rooms are full of response team, but they could clear out one of the two rooms of the library without much trouble; this does imply going through the library first.</p>
            <p>Asmodia was in her bedroom and got swarmed by shadows, after which some summoned monster or another gnawed off all of her legs below her mid-thighs; after Asmodia's body got retrieved, it was dumped in one corner of the library, for use in later Resurrection or Raise Dead + Regenerate.&nbsp; A dead Security wizard's body has been dropped beside her.</p>
            <p>Ione is unconscious, and would ordinarily have been evacced, but, library oracle; if she's got to be in some library that's not a triage center, it might as well be this library?&nbsp; Ione's body is occupying the largest, best-padded chair in the library, arranged with some detectable amount of respect, hands folded in her lap like a noblewoman.&nbsp; Things could have gone <em>much</em> worse without that brief warning to put up buffs and ready items. &nbsp;If Nidal had been able to lock down communications before they could call for reinforcements, or get assassins past the wards without triggering them, it could have been <em>much much</em> worse.</p>
            <p>The other girls are - reading, some of them; Paxti is talking too fast to somebody who's tolerating that; one of them is examining a spiky dagger with a gem-studded hilt, not in the manner of somebody who expects to keep it, but somebody who wants to take a good look at it before Security takes it away.</p>

            <p>Were the two Auguries meant to indicate that this particular Augury was really important - that's plausibly - that's plausibly it, if he'd cast the second Augury then, and got a result of massive disaster from heading outside the Forbiddance, that would've - maybe that was what was meant to happen but how was Keltham supposed to <em>know</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>he'd thought it was one spell to figure out what the spell&nbsp;<em>was</em> and then the second one when he'd had time to think of a question -</p>
            <p>Not his fault, plausibly, in a way that makes sense to blame himself for; there's no obvious actually-general heuristic to update, here, that isn't just "use both Auguries on the first question to enter your mind".&nbsp; Keltham's god might not have been able to exactly predict -</p>
            <p>"I got two Auguries.&nbsp; I thought the first one was to find out what the spell was and the second one was for when I'd had time to think of the right question.&nbsp; If my god thought that three-quarters the first Augury wouldn't fail, but if it did fail, I would use the second one - or if people just always get two Auguries for redundancy - then maybe we weren't supposed to go outside, we were supposed to get a result showing disaster if we went outside and <em>that</em> would have tipped us off&nbsp;<em>without us going outside.</em>&nbsp; If that's true then my god is not a perfect predictor, they're not looking into the future, they're working off a fallible model.&nbsp; In that case they wouldn't have been able to do exact timing, and that attack was set to go off <em>the moment I went outside,</em> not because my god predicted the timing that precisely."</p>
            <p>"Similarly, when it comes to Zon-Kuthon, our two obvious hypotheses are, one, attack was building since yesterday, god warned us of it yesterday.&nbsp; Two, that spell was a warning of something else, I misinterpreted it as Zon-Kuthon, and somehow <em>that</em> triggered the attack by Zon-Kuthon, like by my thinking of him loudly enough that he heard it like a prayer, which does not seem particularly plausible to me but I'm saying it out loud anyways because Golarion."</p>
            <p>Or, of course, somebody in Governance heard him say it, and thought it would be a great thing to fake without the slightest use of subtlety.&nbsp; The light shows overhead - could have been locally faked to look global.&nbsp; Maybe Ione can grab a <em>newspaper</em> from Ostenso library and see if it mentions -</p>
            <p>Well, that might work if Ione is still Ione.</p>

Or could be Security was compromised, or Pilar, or me. Or you, I guess, if we're being thorough, though even then, they'd have had to have activated a magic item or something to alert people, and the others ought to have&nbsp;<em>noticed.&nbsp;</em></p>

Oh and now that Carissa thinks about it the reason Pilar was there was obviously 'some weird thing to do with her oracle powers' and she should not have completed that sentence aloud, though probably Keltham would himself have noticed the discrepancy, at some point...</p>

If we are they’re going to be using all our Raise Dead and Resurrection capacity for the military for a while. I don’t know how badly the villa is damaged, but I think it’ll be in repairs for at least the next couple of weeks, and they might decide to relocate us to the Imperial palace - which is the only other place in Cheliax with a Forbiddance up, and which has security adequate for an invasion from anywhere I’ve heard of. We can ask for that now, if you’d rather be somewhere where something awful didn’t just happen while you rest and recover.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Dath ilani - shouldn't be weak enough to need two weeks of recovery time after their first experience with somebody trying to kill them, should they?&nbsp; Though they certainly have a very, very different attitude towards violence than Cheliax.&nbsp; You learn the potential for defense in reality so that aggression stays confined to counterfactuals.&nbsp; Cheliax has public executions.</p>
            <p>Dath ilan has executions too, in a certain sense; if you intentionally cause someone else's True Death, you don't get kicked to the Last Resort, you get forcibly and preemptively cryosuspended.&nbsp; Not as a deterrent, obviously, because ideal agents ignore those, and Civilization doesn't build structures that would stop working if people became more ideal.&nbsp; Because anybody that dangerous is more danger than Civilization wants to inflict on the non-true-murderers in the Last Resort.&nbsp; Civilization has a motive to preemptively suspend people that dangerous irrespective of its effect on incentives; it's not a <em>threat</em>.</p>
            <p>Obviously if a Chronicler or a family member asked to be present at the preemptive suspension, and the murderer didn't veto it, Governance would hardly block them.&nbsp; You could probably do it as an ordinary concerned citizen and it's hard to see Governance stopping them without an overwhelmingly strong reason.&nbsp; Governance, which has way too much power to say 'no' to things, has to be very circumspect about what it actually says 'no' to, if it doesn't want the Annual Oops It's Time To Overthrow The Government Festival to suddenly turn real.</p>
            <p>Keltham has a suspicion that Cheliax's 'public executions' are not 'public' in the sense of 'open to sufficiently concerned citizens wanting to make sure everything has been done correctly'.&nbsp; It rhymes with Carissa's earlier claim that the thing to do with rats is feed them to other rats in a frenzy of cannibalistic death and sell tickets.&nbsp; Public executions, Keltham suspects, have tickets; though it's the sort of thing he should check later, maybe by asking Carissa what the equilibrium price of the tickets are rather than if the tickets exist at all, if he's feeling paranoid that minute.</p>
            <p>It's not like it's not consistent.&nbsp; It would pass muster as fiction.&nbsp; Low-tech society with poorer coordination, sustained by economicmagic, with healing, resurrections, and afterlives.&nbsp; Losing a finger isn't permanent until the distant Future can restore it; there are clerics.&nbsp; Not-true-death means you come back - well, you come back if you had enough money to buy insurance.&nbsp; Life in Golarion must be a pretty different experience for its relatively wealthy people and relatively poor ones!&nbsp; Like, <em>qualitatively&nbsp;</em>different, two worlds with different tech levels.&nbsp; But everyone gets the afterlife, it sounds like.&nbsp; Unless they betray an oath.&nbsp; Or Nethys touches them.&nbsp; Or how common is that statue business, he should check with somebody else, Carissa doesn't seem like the type to fret about Statistically Improbable Awful Fates.</p>
            <p>And, sure, you can imagine a society like that, where they don't give a shit about violence because the injuries aren't permanent.&nbsp; Where they don't give a shit about death because resurrection and afterlives.&nbsp; A society where people getting near the end of their natural healthspan, when they're starting to feel sick enough and stupid enough that they're not having fun, would have violent fights to the death with one another like that's a sporting event - actually maybe public executions <em>wouldn't</em> sell tickets, those are probably much more boring compared to suicide sports.&nbsp; So why <em>are </em>executions public?&nbsp; He'll try to remember to ask later.</p>
            <p>You could tell a consistent story where a dath ilani boy would be a fragile little flower by comparison to all that, and he'd take a long time to recover from somebody <em>almost</em> sticking him with a sword and instead sticking that sword into a girl he met two days ago.</p>
            <p>Keltham doesn't like this story, and he's trying to decide if that's his real self talking, or just his gendertrope.&nbsp; Well, his gendertrope <em>is</em> him to no trivial degree, he's at 10.2 out of 12 on the gendertrope identification scale.&nbsp; And it's not like zero optimization ever went into making the masculine gendertrope be a useful target for males to try to live up to.&nbsp; But still.</p>
            <p>But it's more that - Keltham has a sense that - there's something false about Cheliax's rejection of the idea that violence could be harmful.&nbsp; That it rhymes with Permanent Cheerfulness and Acting Like Sex Still Works Normally.&nbsp; The pain is still real, the suffering is still real, even if the injury and death are temporary and discarnation isn't the end.&nbsp; This is like - the sort of weird equilibria exhibited as stuff that might happen, if not for Civilization and not for mental training, hence why people have to go on playing strange games with children to let them be not that.&nbsp; A proving-things-to-people equilibrium like a duke's crazy son being challenged to prove his courage by racing a rhinoceros.&nbsp; Where people try to show off really hard how much injury and death don't matter to them, and end up dumping Asmodia's body in a corner without any respect shown to it while her soul's not in it.</p>
            <p>If dath ilan had healing and resurrections, it would not be like that.&nbsp; He doesn't think the Kelthamverse would be like it either.</p>
            <p>Or maybe he's wrong.&nbsp; He hasn't lived in the Kelthamverse plus healing, resurrection, and afterlives.</p>
            <p>But the fact that Chelish people still end up in shock for two weeks after their first fight with demons - suggests that their forcing their minds to be disdainful of violence's impact - doesn't quite work.&nbsp; Is possibly making things worse for them.</p>
            <p><br>"I want to&nbsp;<em>be</em> safe, not&nbsp;<em>feel</em> safer," is what Keltham says to Carissa when she gets back.&nbsp; "I don't think the foreseeable difference in the psychological impact of a semifamiliar place where an attack happened, versus a completely unfamiliar place somewhere else, is great enough to count against a 0.1% difference in actual securability.&nbsp; And - maybe this doesn't apply in this case, but - in dath ilan, if a mental shock isn't mostly better in the morning, and hasn't reached a new equilibrium after three days if it's not better in the morning, that would be the point at which you'd talk to somebody smarter or better-disciplined about mental errors you might be making that would cause internal conflicts to get stuck and not resolve.&nbsp; I won't push myself if it turns out I can't recover that fast, won't try to act outwardly normal if that's not true, but - it's the recovery timescale I would've guessed if you hadn't mentioned anything."</p>
            <p>"Oh, and I register with my amateur Security posturing that it seems to me that bringing Pilar back or contacting her early in the afterlife - to see if <em>she&nbsp;</em>has any idea how or <em>why</em> she was put there - is a Security issue higher than her ordinary resurrection priority."</p>

            <p>"Then some <em>other </em>element of the sequence of events that led to me being outside, must have triggered the attack, or been timed with the attack."</p>
            <p>"Furthermore, though more tentatively, at least one element in this sequence of events was chosen by an adversary of Nidal, because they plausibly would've gotten me inside my bedroom otherwise."</p>
            <p>"This causal sequence started with my asking to cast my cleric spells - no, it started with Carissa returning from her shopping trip at the exact time she did.&nbsp; It ended when I summoned the archon.&nbsp; But I doubt Carissa should be looking for anything that timed the end of her shopping trip, because she had dinner after that, and with prophecy broken, you won't get two-minute timing at the end of a causal sequence like that."</p>
            <p>"Something in that causal sequence either triggered the attack, or was triggered by it."</p>

            <p>- well, exquisitely designed to some unapologetically Evil aesthetics. It has thick red velvet curtains around an enormous iron bed which has actual chains and shackles built into the headboard, and a thick red carpet, and an enormous fireplace against one wall.</p>
            <p>Next to the fireplace is a rack of fire-stoking equipment which a person who knows a lot about fire-stoking, which Keltham hopefully does not, might identify as not even all that useful for that.</p>
            <p>There's a cozy reading nook with an armchair and a tall bookshelves full of leather-bound books, and a little kneeling pillow next to the armchair.</p>
            <p>There's an Asmodean shrine with incense and a stone ritual-seat that you obviously let blood into.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There are beautiful tapestries on the walls, depicting well-dressed people dancing, and there's a window opening on a courtyard full of blooming roses.</p>
