On another, there's something romantic about people having meetings with you about optimizing me, makes it - less like pretending. On another, you've been here for three days and they've been very stressful and you haven't actually signed up for responsibility for optimizing me!

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- so when I went to the sex shop, there was this sort of pervasive assumption that it was - a little like a costume shop, I don't know how to explain it - that some people like to dress up as the possessions of other people during sex, in the same way as some people like to dress up as dragons during sex, and so they'd sell you the outfit for it. And there's nothing wrong with that. But at the Worldwound people were doing something different, something better suited to me, where - you could give terms up front, obviously, but whatever terms you gave, those were real. They weren't a costume, they weren't a game, the whole thing was obviously in an overarching sense governed by the<em> treaty</em> so no one was risking being maimed or murdered but you wouldn't say 'oh, hmm, I'm bored now'.</p>
            <p>And I was slightly worried that the nobility, being the nobility and sort of aliens at best anyway, had the concept but only the costume-party concept." Yep, that's the problem with the Chelish nobility, that they might be assuming by default that their relationship is one of equals-with-some-pretense, <em>definitely </em>not that everyone who doesn't know exactly what's going on assumes what's going on is that Cheliax gave the alien some welcoming gifts. "And if they're asking you, then - then they're not working off a costume-party concept. Even though it's a sort of silly thing for them to have done and I'm sorry you were inconvenienced."</p>

            <p>"I haven't had anticonformity training, yeah," and appreciate the warning this is something you might do to us because wow it sounds kind of nightmarish in the same way as having the Queen show up to mock you for your thoughts from the transcripts she's reading. Except in the opposite direction so getting both at once is double nightmarish.</p>
            <p>There's genuinely something terrifying there, something that feels like realizing you're not standing over solid ground but on a tightrope over the Abyss.</p>
            <p>Or like noticing you could peel all your skin off. It's true but did you really need to notice it.</p>
            <p>Of course most thoughts are the thoughts you're supposed to have.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br>How about a change of subject.</p>
            <p>"Well, when it comes to having girls by force, I think there are actually more women with that fetish than men who want to fulfill it, so maybe you can have fun without handwringing about the market value of the experience you're getting for free. Or maybe you can charge, though the specific nature of the fetish does make it seem hard to do that."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"I am worried that your Alliance is not quite Dark enough, frankly, based on interacting with Isidre and hearing some of her concerns about how much fun the Queen isn't having.&nbsp; Very smart people in dath ilan tend to lean Good.&nbsp; The obvious potential problem with that, if not otherwise averted, is that when you care about a very large number of people, you can end up with very large numbers inside your mental decision processes and especially the parts that do abstract thinking.&nbsp; That can produce thoughts at," edges and vertices of the space of thoughts, "extremes you wouldn't get with a more naturally selfish person where the weights don't go much larger than the weights they put on themselves."</p>
            <p>"Now this, to be clear, is a problem you have to solve with more Law, rather than less Law.&nbsp; If it's a predictable fact that certain ways of thinking are going to make certain mistakes, predict it and then don't make the mistakes.&nbsp; If a Good person ends up thinking it's a good idea to break an oath and go to Abaddon in order to save some larger number of other people from going to Abaddon, they could imaginably be right by their own measures, in which case there's no arguing with the," utility function, "values that entities assign to final outcomes.&nbsp; But I would far more expect to observe that Good people end up systematically mistaken about how much good oathbreaking really does, for example because of the further consequences of people not being able to trust Good people's oaths any more, or anyone's oaths because that person might be secretly Good, or just because Good people usually and systematically end up not saving as many people as they hoped with the sacrifices they make."</p>
            <p>"If you have a lot of very smart Good people, they can train each other out of mistakes like that.&nbsp; I doubt Golarion even bothers to collect <em>statistics</em> on the kind of mistakes that very smart people make."</p>
            <p>"And the other thing about Civilization is that we do not often have to worry about fifteen percent of the population dying.&nbsp; There are not millions of people in fixable-seeming horrible situations, and if there were, you would be working on it with a lot of other people rather than nearly alone.&nbsp; Which probably helps a bunch in practice to keep our smart Good people from ending up at weird extremes without them having to be incredibly Lawful about that."</p>
            <p>"To a dath ilani, Isidre reads strongly as someone with overly large problems to worry about, insufficient Law by dath ilani standards, and an intelligence headband too much more powerful than the headbands of the people around her."</p>

            </a>
          </div>
          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham tries to figure out how he'd feel about telling the Chelish government - well, not to give him Carissa or else, because, like, that is stupid on so many different levels both as decision theory and as a trap that Isidre could be setting for him if she was less than absolutely trustworthy.&nbsp; Please give him Carissa permanently or until he gives her back, to do with as he pleases, and have that be the regulation of Cheliax and not just an arrangement between the two of them, formalizing what Carissa gave him informally, as Carissa herself wants according to your very smart people; and in return Keltham charges Cheliax very very slightly less of their GDP increase, or some such.</p>
            <p>It's not - particularly landing, at this point?</p>
            <p>In a world with Pilars, Keltham can see, somehow - not with the eyes of dath ilan but with the eyes of his own sexuality, that had no place available for it in dath ilan in a way that wasn't anyone's fault - Keltham can see how there could be a submissive!woman gender-subtrope that is like being pursued and dated, but more so. &nbsp;He can imagine how that gender-subtrope of woman might think it was more romantic for a man to desire her so much that he came in and just took her away, paying costs to do that but never asking. &nbsp;The question of how this ends up with the right people matched, and without giant flaming obvious incentive problems if a man likes a woman who doesn't like him back, may perhaps rest on Golarion institutions unknown to him; or it may be a reason why this desire unsatisfiable in reality is fed mainly by Golarion romance novels.</p>
            <p>He can imagine that Carissa wants that - even if he's pretty sure he's not imagining it correctly, true to the real Carissa Sevar, it's enough to explain why <em>a</em> possible person would want that.&nbsp; To be in - metaphorical bed-chains, in her larger social and legal situation, chains that she wears always, as proof that a man wanted her that much.</p>
            <p>Carissa wants it, let's suppose that to be true; does that situation appeal to Keltham himself?</p>
            <p>...not really.&nbsp; The part where Carissa gives herself to him feels deeper and more meaningful, to him, than that choice being taken away from Carissa so that Keltham no longer knows she's still making it. &nbsp;It's a choice that says Keltham is worthy, that he and his sexuality are worth so much to Carissa, that she has judged him and chosen him even though she could have had another, that he is valuable to Carissa in a way he was not so valuable to any woman in dath ilan.</p>
            <p>Is there some way you still get that in full measure, if somebody is with you because they can't escape within Golarion and have opted not to escape to the afterlife?</p>
            <p>Keltham isn't seeing it, for now.&nbsp; Maybe his thoughts are being too crystalline and logical about it; too denying of subtleties and forcing it all into 'well, but then therefore' where people could just opt to not conclude that therefore.&nbsp; Maybe there is a way that Keltham can know Carissa still finds him worthy, even as she lives truly in the world where she has no other choice.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Like the Detect Desires spell, for example.&nbsp; If you have <em>that</em> around for people who can afford it, then it is <em>obviously</em> going to change some things -</p>
            <p>SHIT.</p>
            <p>Does Isidre do <em>that</em> to the people around her.&nbsp; Cast Detect Desires around them, or have it cast by a cleric who reports to her, and maybe not a cleric of Asmodeus either.</p>
            <p>Keltham is trying not to believe it <em>too </em>hard, but his brain just shouted very loudly "YES SHE DOES", because Isidre knows <em>far </em>too much about what various people want.&nbsp; And it is <em>extremely</em> the sort of deontology violation that you'd expect from a Good person with a deficit of Law, an overly powerful intelligence headband, and horrifying problems that are horrifically large.&nbsp; Isidre would reason that the privacy violation was just not really that important, on the scale of twenty million people; and even if her intelligence headband lets her fake some intuitive shadow of the Law of Coordination, she might still argue to herself that knowing more true facts about somebody is not something that ought to cause a breakdown of coordination.&nbsp; Keltham isn't even sure she's wrong, he doesn't have her problems.&nbsp; Call it 75% probability.</p>
            <p>But suppose Carissa is fine with Detect Desires being used on her.&nbsp; Though, maybe that aspect has to be illegible so Carissa doesn't have to admit to herself that she could escape by wanting to be free... well, leave aside the deontology violation of doing it without asking, suppose the thought experiment anyways.&nbsp; Or maybe Carissa says Keltham is entitled to Detect Desires her and truthspell her whenever he wants, because that is part of what it means to give herself to him, and they never have to make mutually legible why or whether Keltham is doing that.</p>
            <p>Consider that Least Convenient Possible World, for the argument against putting Carissa in a situation where the 'absolute-power' (Keltham thinks the Taldane word in Baseline) that Keltham has over her has been formally materialized and made real.&nbsp; The world where Keltham casts Detect Desires every morning, or multiple times per day because Least Convenient Possible World, and the spell always says that Carissa still wants him and judges him worthy and would have him hold 'absolute-power' over her.</p>
            <p>Then what?</p>
            <p>Then Keltham does not really see the added appeal from&nbsp;<em>his</em> perspective; but it is not obviously, or not <em>legibly</em> obviously, something he couldn't do for Carissa to make her happier, at little cost to himself.</p>
            <p>Except for where his mind just screamed that he is tilting further on that dangerous narrow ledge he is standing upon.&nbsp; And also, Isidre warned him not to have that done to Carissa unless <em>he wanted it for himself.</em></p>
            <p>Keltham doing it <em>because Carissa wants it</em> is probably not what Carissa wants either.&nbsp; The Golarion woman's romance novel is about the man who&nbsp;<em>wants you that much in that way</em> and not because he thinks it is something you need to be happy.</p>
            <p>Maybe someday Keltham will come to feel for himself the thing that is the male complement of the gender-subtrope that Carissa has, where he wants for himself to make that 'absolute-power' real, and cast Detect Desires as a guardrail around it, and make it so that if Carissa can't stop wanting him then she can't stop having him either.&nbsp; Maybe someday he'll understand better the grounds he stands on in Golarion, and it will no longer seem like something that would get you kicked out of most cities in dath ilan... well, no, not actually, they're just not going to do that to you in dath ilan, if Carissa is standing there saying 'get the fuck out of our private business, Civilization, I don't need you to protect me'.&nbsp; <em>No victim no crime,</em> as the proverb goes.&nbsp; So it isn't like that.&nbsp; But maybe someday it will stop <em>feeling</em> like that.</p>
            <p>Also Civilization would... what would they even <em>think</em> of a situation where Carissa is going 'Let me out, Civilization, I don't want to be here anymore!', to test the bounds of the chains placed on her and be reassured that they are real, and Detect Desires is showing that Carissa wants <em>desperately </em>for Civilization to laugh maniacally and say 'No you belong to Keltham now!'</p>
            <p>Keltham is sad he will never get to subsidize this question in a voting prediction market.&nbsp; He really wants to know what Civilization would think of it.&nbsp; Well, no, actually he wants to see the enormous flamewar and Very Serious People shouting at each other that would happen if this question really came up.&nbsp; But also he wants to know what Civilization would think of it.</p>
            <p>What does the&nbsp;<em>Kelthamverse</em> think of it?</p>
            <p>...The Kelthamverse is, what, three days old, at this point?&nbsp; The Kelthamverse knows that it is a tiny baby world and wants to refer the question back to Civilization so that it has a good starting point.</p>
            <p>But, mostly, this thoughtsearch has reached quiescence; there is not much expected value of logical information in searching further.&nbsp; Keltham finds no desire within himself, for his own sake, to transform Carissa's free gift to him into a metaphorical chain that she wears always; and for him to do it for her sake is almost surely not what Carissa wants.&nbsp; He will reopen the question when and if he finds within himself that gender-subtrope that is complement to Carissa's.</p>
            <p>And meanwhile, he is not going to say anything to Carissa that sounds like 'Never forget, you've got the right to leave at any time!' because that would be stupid.</p>

            <p>- safer not to lie. Except for how everything is a lie. Carissa has never found lying to be difficult before and these days it's like navigating a dungeon blindfolded.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The fact that Cheliax could mind control Keltham and hasn't is useful evidence of good faith, and also she's already told him that - but also making it clear that Keltham wouldn't notice if sufficiently powerful people did it makes it impossible to preserve an escape avenue where Keltham concludes there's a rot that doesn't extend to the top -&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>" - I'm going to start by saying things I'm very sure of and then get to things I'm less sure of," she says. "So, invasive divinations by default&nbsp;<em>feel like something,&nbsp;</em>it's possible to notice them happening to you. Probably, uh, Contessa Lrilatha, or the Queen herself, could cast an invasive divination you couldn't even detect - they could also do mind control that felt like your own choices - but anyone much less powerful than that would be running a reasonably high chance that their targets would notice. Unless there are some powerful secret magic items involved, which there might be.</p>
            <p>When you cast Detect Desires on me I felt it, and I could've attempted to fight you off and probably succeeded. We should .... make sure you know what that feeling is and that you haven't felt it at any time in the last couple of days. Strongly predict you haven't, though. When the priest on duty at the Worldwound first got a revelation from Asmodeus about you, his instructions to me suggested that Asmodeus had very firmly prohibited - a very wide class of things including some we don't even think of as bad behavior - with respect to you."</p>

And Pilar's second, which makes her even easier to hit. - and Pilar might've agreed to screening for various weird things, when she got back from Elysium, because she'd spent a bunch of time around Chaotic outsiders...</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Trying to cast an invasive divination on the Queen of Cheliax is definitely an incredibly serious crime, like, they would execute you on the spot after making sure you weren't spying&nbsp;<em>for&nbsp;</em>somebody sort of crime. I think trying to cast an invasive divination on people involved in a secret project would be considered a big deal also.

          <div class='post-content'><p>In Keltham's mind, a hypothesis is taking shape, a mental model.<br><br></p>
            <p>To a Chelish eavesdropper, it would look like rather a lot of ~~~~.&nbsp; Seeing the idea as a dath ilani sees it, compactly and at a glance, requires a grasp of underlying math.&nbsp; If Keltham wanted to say it to Carissa, he would need to spell out rather a lot of things and also use a whiteboard.</p>
            <p>Keltham's thought revolves around a standard dath ilani concept that Taldane has no word for.&nbsp; 'Intelligence' translated into this word in Baseline; but Keltham is starting to suspect that this reflects a mistake that Carissa and other language donors are making, not a translation accurate <em>in the world.</em>&nbsp; For translation purposes, one must then fix a new term.</p>
            <p>Call this one 'thinkoomph'.<br><br></p>
            <p>'Thinkoomph' is optimization-as-done-by-humans.&nbsp; Its figure-of-merit is correct prediction, choice of action leading to desired outcomes, the power of inner thoughts over the outer world, the power of cognition to apprehend and effectuate reality. &nbsp;Of course, humans do this in a weird idiosyncratic way, and a random possible simple optimizer that was about as powerful as an average dath ilani would not understand and manipulate reality in the same way as an average dath ilani. &nbsp;But if everyone involved is a human, then to speak of 'thinkoomph' as a thing-humans-do whose figure-of-merit is optimization, is not too unsensible a concept.</p>
            <p>Keltham does not need to think about this part right now, he has already chunked the notion of 'thinkoomph' long ago.&nbsp; 'Thinkoomph' is a view into the processes that humans do to produce optimization, viewed from the standpoint where its purpose is optimization, and where the information-theoretic goal of the viewpoint you're taking is to make it easy to describe those usual variations among humans that contribute to the variations in their optimization power.</p>
            <p>Thinkoomph then is not a single number but a structure with some internals.&nbsp; But it happens to be empirically the case that a lot of usefully-discussable smartness-components map not-too-terribly onto a unidimensional line, such that, holding the rest of a mind constant, you get more optimization power as you move up along the line.</p>
            <p>For ease of visualization, then, consider thinkoomph as a seven-dimensional thing, because it happens that there's a useful component analysis like that in dath ilan which gives you seven dimensions.</p>
            <p>Or consider thinkoomph as a machine with seven gears each of varying size, if you don't want to visualize seven-dimensional objects for some weird reason.</p>
            <p>Suppose Detect Intelligence gives you an imperfect partial view of thinkoomph that's made up of, say, (1) speed/clarity of information retrieval plus (2) how much information you can maintain in short-term memory. &nbsp;Detect Wisdom gives you an imperfect partial view of (3) the piece of thinkoomph that's perceptual clarity, which critically has a subpiece (3a) that is clarity and detail and accuracy of introspection.&nbsp; Which is to say - shifting viewpoints from the machinery to the result that machinery produces - that Detect Wisdom imperfectly measures the machinery that grinds to produce reflection.<br><br></p>
            <p>In dath ilan the proverb-poem goes: &nbsp;'Beware lest what you can measure easily becomes all that you measure; beware lest it become all that you optimize; beware lest it become all that you ever think of.'</p>
            <p>The people of Golarion know how to Detect Intelligence and Detect Wisdom, and that's it. &nbsp;So they think there are two components of thinkoomph. &nbsp;They invent two spells to boost the thing-that-Detect-Intelligence-detects and the thing-that-Detect-Wisdom-detects.</p>
            <p>They invent headbands to boost the thing-that-Detect-Intelligence-detects.&nbsp; The amount the headband sells for depends on how large of a shift it produces in that handy spell Detect Intelligence, which, as everyone in Golarion knows, detects Intelligence.&nbsp; If the Detect Intelligence spell says that a headband produces a +3 to Intelligence, it's worth less money than if Detect Intelligence says that the headband produces +4 to intelligence.</p>
            <p>Imagine now that nobody has invented Detect Wisdom yet, just Detect Intelligence.&nbsp; Imagine that somebody with a vision of broader thinkoomph builds a new headband that would, if you could also run Detect Wisdom, show to produce a +3 to Intelligence and a +3 to Wisdom.&nbsp; This headband is probably more expensive to build than the one that produces +4 to Intelligence, probably by a lot, and the Detect Intelligence spell says that it produces an inferior result than the +4 headband.&nbsp; So nobody builds a headband like that, if they don't have Detect Wisdom.</p>
            <p>Does either Intelligence or Wisdom incorporate creativity, outside-the-box solutions, outside-the-box hypotheses?&nbsp; Maybe when Keltham dares to try on an intelligence headband, if he ever so dares, it'll be immediately apparent to him that this headband boosts every part of cognition that Owl's Wisdom didn't boost.&nbsp; But Keltham is guessing that this will prove to not be the case.<br><br></p>
            <p>Consider, then, the world in which Golarion has a Detect Intelligence spell and a Detect Wisdom spell, but these are only 3 out of 7 components of cognition.</p>
            <p>It's not the kids with highest thinkoomph who get tracked to be wizards.&nbsp; It's the kids with the highest Detected Intelligence.</p>
            <p>It is of course famously true that in humans (and describing humans is what the concept of 'thinkoomph' is all about), most things you can measure about thinkoomph's components or outputs will all correlate with each other quite a lot.&nbsp; The kids with Intelligence 14, which Keltham thinks was supposed to be the wizard-tracking threshold, do tend to have Wisdom 12 rather than Wisdom 10.&nbsp; But if you were looking&nbsp;<em>not-at-random</em> at somebody with Intelligence 14, <em>selected on high Intelligence, </em>and asking 'what are the rest of their thinkoomph components like', then the rest are probably more like what their Wisdom score happened to be.</p>
            <p>When you select on kids with high Detected Intelligence, you're not just selecting for kids with high general thinkoomph levels that produce high Intelligence along the way, you're selecting for kids whose Intelligence is unusually high compared to the rest of their thinkoomph.&nbsp; That's why the Wisdom comes out as 12 instead of 14.<br><br></p>
            <p>Dath ilan has heritage-optimized itself over generations&nbsp;<em>in full awareness of how all these measurement and optimization gotchas work.</em>&nbsp; They are doing their best to measure real-world results broadly, and doing genetics and statistics to them.&nbsp; Dath ilan does not want to end up testing some weird projection of thinkoomph that originally started out correlated with thinkoomph, optimizing over this weird projection, and ending up with optimized things that have much more of the weird projected quality than they have thinkoomph.&nbsp; Dath ilan wants&nbsp;<em>actual thinkoomph</em> and is explicitly not pursuing it the stupid way.</p>
            <p>So you've got your kid with Intelligence 18 and Wisdom 14 and they get wizard-tracked and get a +6 intelligence headband or maybe, if they become spectacularly successful, a relic with +6 Intelligence and +4 Wisdom, and if they're incredibly insanely successful, they get 2 or 3 layered Wish spells on top of that.&nbsp; They end up, say, with 27 Intelligence and 21 Wisdom; in dath ilani terms, those subcomponents of thinkoomph would now be at +4.5sd and +1.5sd respectively.</p>
            <p>But their other 4 out of 7 thinkoomph characteristics are still around 14; or in dath ilani terms, if the scales match, -2sd.&nbsp; Golarionites don't know how to easily measure these other components; they don't try to boost them; they don't think about them.</p>
            <p>This sounds a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more like a model consistent with Golarion, than the model where <em>anyone </em>with +6 thinkoomph has literally ever existed here.&nbsp; You don't need training to be a Keeper at +6 thinkoomph, you just are one.<br><br></p>
            <p>Inside Keltham's mind this is all a much shorter and better-chunked thing to think; what he thinks, roughly, is 'Hey maybe they got Goodhart's Cursed on Intelligence and Wisdom metrics'.</p>
            <p>Only Keltham's actual thought is that thinkoomph is the underlying true value; Intelligence and Wisdom are imperfect proxy measures of thinkoomph; optimization over Intelligence and Wisdom will select not just on thinkoomph but on upward divergence of measured Intelligence and Wisdom scores from underlying thinkoomph scores; that this applies both to selecting students for wizard-tracking and for boosting them with Intelligence headbands later; and that this will of course produce people who may detect as +4 Intelligence and +4 Wisdom but who started with something like -2 or -1 underlying general abstracted-correlation-of-thinkoomph-components, and now have something more like +1 final-optimization-power as a result of all that Intelligence and Wisdom boosting.<br><br></p>
            <p>Nobody with +6 thinkoomph has ever walked through this place.&nbsp; They'd shred it around themselves like tissue paper.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>After a bit of silence, relaxing again, mentally leaning into the massage, and yes, very briefly poking some internal curiosity about what exactly it&nbsp;<em>is</em> that is Pilar's obligate fetish precisely speaking, Keltham returns to contemplating more sexual questions.<br><br></p>
            <p>How does he feel about renting Carissa out?</p>
            <p>...mostly he's still getting a WHAT from his brain.<br><br></p>
            <p>Can he evaluate it concretely rather than abstractly?</p>
            <p>Not without having actually met the Queen of Cheliax at all.<br><br></p>
            <p>Okay, but, Keltham does know some people.&nbsp; He even knows some female people, in case this is a polarized gendertrope with respect to the renting individual.&nbsp; How does Keltham feel about renting Carissa to his max-mutual-wordcount coauthor from his fic-circle back in dath ilan, who happens to possess the requisite parts?</p>
            <p>...sad about never writing anything with her again, also, she's&nbsp;<em>proooobably&nbsp;</em>not a sadist like at all(??), also, maybe it actually is not a terribly good idea to think right now about people who believe he's Truly Dead.<br><br></p>
            <p><em>Keltham knows some female people inside a totally different universe that is not that universe.</em>&nbsp; He doesn't know them very well but he can ask himself the concrete question anyways.&nbsp; What if he were to rent Carissa to, say, Tonia Barrero, in repayment of the debt he owes her for an unexpected, un-volunteered-in-advance, at-best-semi-consensual truthspelling?</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>Still file not found, here, he doesn't know Tonia well enough.<br><br></p>
            <p>Keltham knows what to do in this cognitive situation!&nbsp; <em>For purposes of testing this function,</em> keep supplying imaginary values to the Tonia structure until he can complete the function call!&nbsp; If at any point he gets a negative result he can then tweak values to see if there's any value that produces a positive result instead, and then he'll also know what properties he's looking for!</p>
            <p>Let Tonia be a sadist, but, like, a young sadist who's only slightly more experienced there than Keltham, and in no danger of providing Carissa with an unforgettable experience less forgettable than other experiences she's already had, thereby causing Carissa to leave him for Tonia who is the superior sadist...</p>
            <p>...actually Keltham is not sure he really needs this part of the spec, Carissa's current attraction to him is not because Keltham is a supersadist, and therefore it is Perfectly Pseudo-Reasonable that you can't steal Carissa from him by being a better supersadist.&nbsp; Alas, that which is Perfectly Pseudo-Reasonable is not always Perfectly Reasonable.&nbsp; Anyways, fix the current values at favorable ones to see if this function returns 'false' even under quite favorable circumstances.</p>
            <p>Tonia can hurt Carissa slightly more than Keltham, but not threateningly so; she can't give Carissa an orgasm due to Carissa's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">eroLARP character arc posing a</span> sex problem, so Tonia's not threateningly better than him there.&nbsp; And if Tonia was, Keltham could always just tell Carissa she's not allowed... okay something reacted to <em>that</em> inside him, that didn't react to hearing about the magical-item Belt of No Touch.&nbsp; Possibly because in this case there was any reason for it, and that made the scenario more real.</p>
            <p>Or say mostly, in this scenario, Carissa is being rented to Tonia in order to provide Tonia with not-necessarily-reciprocated pleasure just like if Tonia had bought a sex worker in dath ilan.&nbsp; Suppose Carissa doesn't hate it - Keltham's Carissamodel is now complaining that he is not supposed to check this and that offends her dignity of being harder to hurt than that, well, sorry, Carissamodel, that is not what Keltham is optimizing right now.&nbsp; Carissa even manages to have a moderately fun time because Tonia hurts her some and reacts in a way that makes Carissa feel pride in her own sexual skills and it... actually matters to her that Keltham told her to do it?&nbsp; Postulating this part feels hard; Keltham is not himself a Carissa and he is not sure what it is like on the inside to be a Carissa.<br><br></p>
            <p>Keltham thinks he is at least <em>not obviously not-okay</em> with this whole sort of thing?&nbsp; It feels a lot like asking, in an ordinary relationship, how you would feel about your partner going out for a night with somebody else who'd been like 'yeah screw flirting what's your monetary price'.&nbsp; He wouldn't have objected to that back in dath ilan, he wasn't that monogamous with anyone.</p>
            <p>...that these feel like similar questions, probably reflects Keltham <em>failing to get to grips with the actual gendertrope here.&nbsp; </em>Isidre seemed to think this should&nbsp;<em>not</em> feel like the same gendertrope as sex work, even if it had similar gender ratios.</p>
            <p>For one thing, Keltham was&nbsp;<em>aromantic</em> back in dath ilan because he is a&nbsp;<em>romantically obligate sadist,</em> or at least the very first masochist he ran into was the first person he ever started feeling at all like he needed something from her that was about it being <em>from her</em> and didn't funge with things he could possibly get from somewhere else.</p>
            <p>How would Keltham feel about Carissa trading herself to somebody for - one unskilled-labor-week is, like 1.2gp or so?&nbsp; Let's say 2gp, Carissa is hot.</p>
            <p>Parts of Keltham are not happy with this.&nbsp; Because Carissa is <em>his?</em>&nbsp; Because Keltham is insecure about whether that would mean Carissa still liked him more than she likes anybody else?&nbsp; Because Keltham is supposed to give permission first?&nbsp; Keltham doesn't know.</p>
            <p>But if Keltham orders Carissa to do it?&nbsp; For whatever reason?</p>
            <p>- then that's okay.&nbsp; Possibly.&nbsp; At least if all the other call values are set to Imaginary Tonia settings.</p>
            <p><br>And with likely settings on the Queen of Cheliax, rather than favorable settings on Tonia?&nbsp; If, in exchange for an ultimately insignificant symbolic amount of money, and with at least some pressure on the side to deny a trope and perhaps the entire theory of tropism, Carissa is rented to Abrosomething Thrune?&nbsp; Older than Carissa, with the same de facto ability to chain her for real if she really wanted (assuming that Keltham did not object, which he would), probably a much much more experienced sadist than Keltham, with access to far more powerful sex toys that are the equivalent of overpowered vibrators with biofeedback functions and, yes, the ability to make Carissa come.</p>
            <p>...it's not quite an obvious 'no'.&nbsp;&nbsp;It basically depends, Keltham is pretty sure, on whether Keltham is afraid that Carissa can be taken&nbsp;<em>away</em> from him by somebody being a better sadist to her, than he can be for a while yet.&nbsp; If somebody is the more skillful manipulator of masochism, of, what did Isidre call it, submission, can they steal away Carissa's feelings from him?&nbsp; The threat of giving Carissa an orgasm, the threat of also having potential absolute-power over her, seem less real than that.</p>
            <p>Keltham's hindbrain, which may, of course, be entirely factually wrong about everything, intuits that it is basically not possible to steal Carissa by giving her a good-enough orgasm.&nbsp; Hurting her, maybe, understanding the deep keys to her sexuality that Keltham is still struggling with; but not with humanly reasonable amounts of pleasure short of dangerous drugs.<br><br></p>
            <p>And as for the absolute-power threat, in part, it doesn't feel as real because Keltham has not internalized a model of whatever it is that Carissa has inside her.&nbsp; But also, it's impossible for two people to&nbsp;<em>both</em> have potential absolute-power over someone.&nbsp; If they came into conflict, after all, only one of them could get their way.&nbsp; So long as that person would be Keltham, rather than the Queen of Cheliax, everything would be fine, right?&nbsp; It just has to be clear to Carissa that if Keltham and the Queen fought over her, Keltham would be the one to end up with her; if that's true, the keys to her sexuality would be safe.</p>
            <p>...not that Keltham is thinking that he can, like, wield more political power inside Cheliax than its own Nearly Unilateral Chief Executive.&nbsp; But the Queen of Cheliax has to be sensible and consider things like political capital with the Church of Asmodeus, while Keltham can be much less sensible and walk out on Cheliax if the Queen steals his girl from him.&nbsp; It shouldn't be about power alone, Keltham doesn't think; differential <em>willingness to use power</em> should be an acceptable coin to Carissa's sexuality.&nbsp; It controls who would&nbsp;<em>actually</em> end up with her, if it came to that.</p>
            <p>Keltham's not willing, not today, to bargain a probabilistic or absolute walkout on Cheliax, in order to tell the government of Cheliax to hand Carissa over to him in-legal-reality, to say that he considers her a necessary part of his gains-from-trade.</p>
            <p>Telling Cheliax that he considers Carissa a necessary part of his gains-from-trade and he'll walk out if the Queen steals her, either by kidnapping her, <em>or </em>by renting her from Keltham but then giving her an experience that shifts her romantic focus away from Keltham to the Queen?&nbsp; She's Keltham's, the Queen can't have her except temporarily?</p>
            <p>Sure!&nbsp; <em>That,</em> he feels totally willing to do.</p>
            <p><br>Carissa would...&nbsp;<em>probably</em> find that hot?&nbsp; Keltham's Carissamodel confidently finds it <em>very</em> hot if Keltham actually wins at it, but Keltham is not entirely confident in his Carissamodel.</p>
            <p>Well, at least Keltham should definitely win?&nbsp; He can't really see any functional Chief Executive being like 'lol no I'm gonna take Carissa and watch you walk out on Cheliax', and even if the Queen wanted to, her advisors would stop her.&nbsp; She's an overly-Good person in an overly-Good government that has to be stopped by Asmodeus from resorting to outright mind control when it looks like that might be for the greater good of the country.&nbsp; Keltham isn't pure Evil, sure, but he's not <em>that</em> Good, which means he should win this particular contest.</p>
            <p>Of course, that's only if people are running on sanity.&nbsp; If the Queen is running on <em>tropes</em>, she'll try to steal Carissa no matter how bad it would be for Cheliax if she succeeded... but then if those events are running on tropes, it's impossible to win Carissa's true love-sexuality <em>without</em> winning a fight for real power over her,&nbsp;the Queen should ultimately fail to do that after making worrying progress, and then end up kicked up out of Cheliax and/or harem-recruited.</p>
            <p><br>Anyways, he's got enough of an answer that his next step is to ask Isidre to meet again and check his model of how all this works.&nbsp; Or ask Carissa?&nbsp; He kind of wants to ask Isidre first, before he tries to talk with Carissa; Isidre is more willing to be legible, and nothing blows up if he says the wrong thing in front of her.</p>

            <p>- there's not actually much point contemplating what having sex with the Queen of Cheliax would be like, and not just because that definitely counts as flirting with her.

It'll probably be - so, being hurt isn't upsetting, being hurt can be fun and even when it's more than she can take, like the cursed bag, it's not upsetting, it's bad but it's a specific kind of bad that's all right.

          <div class='post-content'><p>Pending questions resolved into a state of quiescence, Keltham relaxes more into the massage.&nbsp; It's nice.&nbsp; Does he want to command some non-reciprocated sexual service from Carissa, at the end of this?</p>
            <p>The idea of ordering her to do it - seems more comfortable now, possibly it has something to do with having heard that she has any coherently imaginable endgame, maybe it's just a shock having had time to sink in and for Keltham to adjust.</p>
            <p>But then his libido might go offline for a while.&nbsp; He shouldn't expend his newly refilled ero reservoir if he needs to have another conversation with Isidre today... it's not clear how urgent this whole thing is, exactly?</p>
            <p>"Carissa," Keltham says out loud, his voice coming out sounding as relaxed as he is, "I'm too relaxed right now to really want to move, so can I ask you to have them return my reply to Isidre that I'm interested in further discussing her second suggested course of action, though I'm not yet on a definite yes.&nbsp; And can I possibly get a yes-no in the next ten minutes about whether or not Isidre wants to meet me again today."</p>
            <p>(It wouldn't occur to Keltham that Isidre might not imagine him to be capable of a quick reconsideration and answer.&nbsp; One hour is a long time to think in dath ilan, and sure it may take&nbsp;<em>longer</em>&nbsp;to reconsider some major life questions, but there's no presumption that you&nbsp;<em>can't</em> do it in an hour.&nbsp; It similarly wouldn't occur to Keltham that he ought not ask a Senior Governance Official for a yes-no answer in ten minutes; somebody like Isidre is surely interrupted often enough, and good enough at task-switching, that she's checking her tiny-task queue every eight minutes, in Isidre's computer-based and network-connected task management system; which will continue to go on existing in Keltham's imagination and his preprogrammed social reflexes unless and until he thinks explicitly about that question for literally half of a second.)</p>

            <p>Keltham has further thoughts on renting Carissa to the Queen of Cheliax. That's terrifying, but definitely a success. Carissa is going to let herself enjoy her success without dwelling too much on its implications for whether she gets tortured which is ultimately not the thing that matters here.</p>

            <p>Keltham doesn't... <em>especially</em> feel like massaging Carissa back, apparently, if he is honest with himself about that.&nbsp; He would do it if they were trading pleasures, obviously, but he does not seem to really actually <em>want</em> to give massages.</p>
            <p>He still feels grateful for it, and a need to do something nice for Carissa in return, no matter how much she says he doesn't have to; he wants to anyways.</p>
            <p>Keltham doesn't feel like massaging her back.&nbsp; But he does feel like... buying a massage for her, as soon as he's got any 'gold pieces'?&nbsp; That seems like the blatantly obvious solution -</p>
            <p>The thought of a stranger touching Carissa's naked body does not feel especially pleasant.</p>
            <p>Keltham is not <em>used</em> to his brain working like this, and it's causing his self-model to stumble over itself repeatedly.</p>
            <p>...he could pay one of the other girls to give Carissa a massage&nbsp;<em>from</em> him?</p>
            <p>For that matter, if he doesn't have any gold yet, he could tell Ione to do it after she's recovered.</p>
            <p>Is Keltham allowed to <em>do</em> that, does it count as something Ione offered him?</p>
            <p>Well, Keltham doesn't have any massive anti-legibility issues with Ione, so he can just <em>ask,</em> which will make his life massively simpler.&nbsp; Keltham's guess is that Ione's objection, if she has any, will be that Carissa might ask what got traded to Ione for the massage, and Ione doesn't want to mention the Nethys thing to Carissa.&nbsp; But they could just tell Carissa it's a secret, so that doesn't seem like a problem?</p>
            <p>Seems like a plan.</p>

            <p>While he stutters, rapid messages delivered by magic where Keltham can't hear:</p>
            <p>Queen's transcript is ready for Sevar.</p>
            <p>Asmodeus has given them a directive to move Keltham to a new location, one that will somehow be more protected from divine interference than even the palace, as soon as Aspexia can get a new Forbiddance spell and put that up tomorrow at dawn.&nbsp; They're not to spare any expense, this time; Cheliax is suddenly wealthier than expected, for reasons to be described later.</p>
            <p>The anti-interference divine protection <em>should </em>prevent any more oracles from being created, even if someone on site isn't soul-sold.</p>
            <p>Maillol is still recovering.&nbsp; Sevar's input is requested in Maillol's place about the new project setup.&nbsp; Possibly Keltham's input should be solicited too?</p>
            <p>What do they tell Keltham, what message does the page have for Keltham?&nbsp; <em>Some </em>lies seem required and Sevar is the only one who can authorize them.</p>

Most urgent question is what to tell Keltham. ...they're setting up a new project site, and want his input into anything it'd be particularly useful for it to have. If he asks for an explanation, the damage to the villa was more extensive than expected. "Yes, Keltham's here. I can take a message, or depart, if it's secret."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Two of the Securities peel off as soon as they're out of sight of Keltham's door and get on with their real jobs.&nbsp; The remaining one escorts Carissa to a room where she can review her notes, and hands her a sealed packet that contain the Queen's slightly censored transcript of Keltham's thoughts.<br><br></p>
            <p>The Security also recounts recent events at somewhat greater length.</p>
            <p>Rather a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of diamonds suddenly materialized around Otolmens's oracle.</p>
            <p>There's an obvious thought about where those diamonds might have come from, and their best hopes there seem to be actually coming true.&nbsp; Nidal shifted to a more tightly defensive, conservative, and dare one hope, <em>worried</em> posture afterwards.&nbsp; It's not the same kind of game-over as if Zon-Kuthon had been destroyed and his clerics depowered, but the remaining timeline is looking like months, not years.</p>
            <p>Nobody has any good idea of <em>how</em> Nidal managed to piss off Otolmens this much, except, obviously, that it had something to do with Nidal's intentions for Keltham.&nbsp; It nonetheless implies that people should tread <em>even more carefully,</em> which shouldn't, in fact, be possible in the first place when you are dealing with an Otolmens event, but nonetheless, do consider, this is what happens when Otolmens gets <em>pissed.</em>&nbsp; If anybody manages to piss Otolmens off <em>at Cheliax instead,</em> then perhaps all the diamonds in Cheliax will be teleported to Lastwall!&nbsp; It is the considered belief of Grand High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonn that this would be a bad idea, and people should not do it!&nbsp; Or come close to doing it.&nbsp; Or think too much about doing it.&nbsp; Or do anything that is 'not technically doing it'.&nbsp; Or do something that really shouldn't piss Otolmens off <em>that </em>much if Otolmens is being reasonable.&nbsp; Just don't, fucking, mess, with Otolmens.&nbsp; If anybody thinks that Rugatonn is trying to tell them anything especially complicated here, they should come to Rugatonn for clarification about how she is really, in fact, saying something very simple.&nbsp; Or they can just kill themselves directly.&nbsp; Rugatonn is happy with either outcome.</p>
            <p>Maillol, who received Asmodeus's vision while being personally tortured by Gorthoklek, briefly and barely pulled himself together to communicate the bones of their Lord's vision:&nbsp; Asmodeus communicated a complex attitude about Otolmens's sudden gift, which suggests that Otolmens has well overpaid for the new project to have adequate security precautions; and while they shouldn't even remotely try to spend as much as Otolmens actually paid, they're not supposed to just take the money and run, either.</p>
            <p>The new project location will have <em>actual fucking security</em> this time, and any complaints about the budget should be considered in the light of Otolmens's apparent concern and corresponding generosity.</p>
            <p>Asmodeus's sent vision requires very strongly that Keltham needs to be not too far from Ostenso.&nbsp; Asmodeus's vision implies that Keltham should be within the designated region the moment it's safe; so as soon as a new Forbiddance can be put up, somewhere Nidal hopefully won't know about; hence, shortly after dawn tomorrow when Rugatonn can request a Forbiddance spell.</p>
            <p>They're currently thinking of renovating an old coastal fortress.</p>

            <p>Carissa's preferred thing to tell Keltham about this is the truth, that Cheliax is acting on orders from Otolmens; she thinks that Keltham is more likely to break rules in a way that offends Otolmens accidentally than he is to do so deliberately, and if he were doing it deliberately he'd likely at least take cautionary measures like running it by Carissa first or maybe talking to Broom. Otolmens intervention seems like the sort of thing that might be clearer from Keltham's perspective than theirs and which is therefore going to end up being even harder to hide. She assumes Aspexia Rugatonn will veto this, so she wants to give a story that <em>isn't incompatible&nbsp;</em>with telling him that later, which probably means just telling him that the relocation is for Security reasons they can't disclose at this time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Carissa would appreciate a further briefing on known things about Otolmens, at some point.</p>
            <p>Coastal fortress seems fine. Keltham seems plenty attached to luxury, even knowing how desperately poor everyone in the world is; she isn't sure if it'll actually hit him for Evil if they fund his luxuries with brutal taxation of some distant village but it seems worth exploring. Plumbing is a must.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She assumes from the fact the packet is sealed that she is intended to read it alone.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>On usual policy they could, in principle, tell Keltham that they're doing it on orders from Broom's god, so long as they don't tell him that Broom's god is specifically about <em>world-destroying</em> or <em>multiverse-destroying</em> threats and allow him to go on thinking that She's mostly about preventing giant flaming Wish craters.&nbsp; Rugatonn would have to review the disclosure that this move was on Broom's god's request, but she wouldn't necessarily say no.</p>
            <p>Security also notes that Cheliax, of course, acts on only Asmodeus's orders, even if Asmodeus perhaps bargains with other gods as part of His business; even Otolmens surely would not dare to <em>instruct</em> Him so, or give Him <em>orders</em> to pass along, and the generosity of Her payment suggests that She bargained with Asmodeus from a position of weakness.&nbsp; To suggest that Cheliax is in any way acting on <em>Otolmens's orders</em> would be a lie, which Sevar is welcome to authorize explicitly.&nbsp; (Weirdly, Security does not hurt her about this.)</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Hmm. With approval from the Grand High Priestess, she wants them to tell Keltham that their present understanding is that Broom's god of messes requested the move and heightened security generally, and that Asmodeus instructed it, and maybe even that the instruction was specifically to go somewhere near Ostenso. The most obviously useful thing here is Keltham being reluctant to leave the area, though mostly Carissa's operating on the assumption that this has weird correlates she can't see.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And she'll take a look at the transcript now. She does not ask if that means her mind won't be read while she reads it; it might instead just mean her mind is being read directly by Abrogail or something, and anyway 'my mind isn't presently being read' is a bad starting point for thought.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Abrogail's transcript contains a censored section right at the most exciting part about the Second Law, with notes saying that Keltham thought things about other people's knowledge of these truths driving them insane and possibly collapsing the universe, that most of his thoughts were incomprehensible ideas with no remote conceptual neighbors in any language that Abrogail knows, and that the parts that did make it through were incredibly fucking disturbing.&nbsp; Abrogail is obviously saying this because she knows how terribly curious it will make Sevar about the one part she most wanted to know, <em>but it is also true</em>, and Rugatonn requires further thought on whether Sevar gets to see this.</p>
            <p>Abrogail has included a more detailed explanation of why Sevar is being tortured, with particular torture codes from her sheet being noted at particular points that all sum up exactly to the total amount of torture she received in her original note.</p>
            <p>The most severe torture code is annotated on the section where Keltham thought about his secret plan to establish a fully legible meta-level signal via the no-verbal-objections order.&nbsp; This looks like a huge setback for their corruption plans.&nbsp; If Sevar noticed this at all, which was <em>her </em>job, then she didn't think about it in words and it didn't show up in her thought transcript, meaning Abrogail got blindsided here.&nbsp; Abrogail isn't sure how to recover, Sevar didn't say anything to the effect of how most masochists wouldn't go along with it even if Sevar herself is fine, or how she could do it for a month no problem but after any longer of not being allowed to scream and beg she would probably start to feel sad.&nbsp; Maybe when Keltham gets to the appropriate point Sevar can confess that she's starting to feel sad.&nbsp; Keltham is unfortunately <em>explicitly suspicious</em> that Cheliax is trying to lure him into rape.&nbsp; But even if Sevar's opinion is that any objection to Keltham's plan would have made him too suspicious, Sevar didn't apparently notice, and definitely didn't report it explicitly.&nbsp; Bad Sevar, go to your torture room.</p>
            <p>The second-worst torture code is for Sevar thinking about how the Queen of Cheliax was being <em>stupid </em>for saying a 'worse version' than the one Sevar suggested.&nbsp; When, in fact, the Queen of Cheliax has higher Perception than Sevar can fucking dream of and it was warning her off Sevar's version verbatim, possibly because Keltham would've been able to identify it as coming from Sevar.&nbsp; Sevar's failure to <em>imagine</em> that the Queen of Cheliax could have any good reason for <em>presuming to not do exactly what Sevar said</em> reveals an actual problem of subordination here and that's why this punishment is severe.&nbsp; Thinking about lighting Abrogail on fire despite knowing you might get punished for thinking that was not the problem, that's just flirting and will be dealt with separately.</p>
            <p>The third-severest torture code, also appearing in the original sum of codes Carissa was given, is the fee for making the fucking Queen of Cheliax spell all this out for Sevar in the annotations because Sevar apparently cannot imagine her Queen ever being professional about anything.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>- okay, you know what, that's actually completely reasonable. And it's true that Carissa has been having a hard time imagining her Queen being professional about anything, though in her defense, that's because -</p>
            <p>- well, the thing Keltham said, about how a pragmatic person in the Queen's position would simply have sex with someone other than Carissa.</p>
            <p>But. The Queen is who she is, and wants what she wants, and is clearly quite good at her job while wanting some things that offer constraints on how she does her job, and Carissa was in fact underrating that, internally, assuming the Queen was less capable than she was, and the punishment is warranted, and she should have assumed the punishment would be warranted. She'll get it done before she leaves for a coastal fortress in Ostenso.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She's extremely annoyed about the part she really wants being censored, but she thinks nonetheless she understands the Second Law stuff well enough to be working around, now, and well enough to be considering some strategies like saying dramatically ironic things that have no payoff at all because reality doesn't actually pay attention to dramatic irony. (Keltham made a&nbsp;<em>face,&nbsp;</em>when she asserted she wasn't a Kuthite spy.)</p>
            <p>She has several ideas for working around the no-order thing, though she didn't see what Keltham was playing at until the transcript and isn't delighted by it. Firstly, she's not actually sure that it wouldn't ding a person for Evil, if they are in the habit of ordering their slaves not to refuse them and vaguely intend that, if ever disobeyed about that, they'd stop the game and let the slave go. In Carissa's particular case it's going to be more complicated but as a general order Keltham's in the habit of giving it seems in some ways advantageous; maybe they can arrange for him to give that order to someone else who 1) will understand Keltham's intent as the obvious 'you are not entitled to refuse me, so don't', 2) has adequate self-control and won't in fact trigger it and 3) (this one might be inconvenient) will react with arousal to treatment they desperately wish they weren't subject to. And then make it gradually clearer to Keltham over time that the reason he's being obeyed is because he's entitled to obedience, not because it's sexy per se. Secondly, Carissa's planning to eventually raise with Keltham that always following orders is in fact less sexy than sometimes breaking orders and being suitably punished for that, so hopefully he can just not-update the orders about 'no' as they gradually transition to a model where he doesn't have her obedience so much as the right and means to compel it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Can someone alert Carissa please when Maillol's competent to take over project duties, and in the mean time hand her any project related work that's been sitting, so she can hand it off to him in relatively good shape while she goes for her punishment?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(She's not scared, even though she's definitely never had half an hour before and knows this kind of thing is not linear in effects. That would be pathetic, and she's not that pathetic.)</p>

            <p>"I - think Carissa has some equivalent of what a dath ilani would call 'dignity', which translates via Share Language to Taldane dignity but I suspect is really not the same thing at all.&nbsp; Carissa's 'dignity' is that she is impossible to truly hurt, even by running a sword through her and then refusing to Raise her, which is what makes it safe for the man to whom she's completely given herself to do anything he wants with her, and not be afraid."</p>
            <p>"And if we were all in dath ilan, she could tell me that was true, and I would maybe check in with a Keeper first to see if they thought Carissa was in generally good," epistemic health, "belief-health, but then the fact that Carissa thought that was true about herself would be very reliable evidence, because <em>dath ilani know how to see within themselves if that sort of thing is actually true.</em>"</p>
            <p>"The fact that I got trained in that explicitly, and warned about a lot of pitfalls, suggests that, if that training actually did anything, Chelish people should actually be much worse at distinguishing - what&nbsp;<em>should</em> be true about themselves, what they&nbsp;<em>want</em> to be true about themselves, from what actually&nbsp;<em>is</em> true about themselves."</p>
            <p>"I'm worried that Carissa is just answering me from within her model of what Carissa&nbsp;<em>should be</em> and that model is not rigorously separated and distinguished from what Carissa&nbsp;<em>is.</em>&nbsp; Which seems like the really obvious mistake that, say, I would make, if you took all the dath ilani training out of somebody otherwise with my exact heritage."</p>
            <p>"If I try to discuss this with my Carissamodel, my Carissamodel says back that Chelish dignity also says that it's her place to safeguard her own safety and not rely on anybody else to protect her when she's giving herself away, that it would be undignified for her to be relying on me to think about her safety.&nbsp; I don't then feel happy and reassured when my Carissamodel says this back to me, and I don't know where to go from there."</p>

            <p>An observation that might be useful to Keltham is that - by the standards of dath ilan, it's plausible that almost no one is competent to know what they actually want and what they can withstand, and yet they do still have to make decisions and do things, and it can simultaneously be true that they might be wrong and that it is impossible to do better than treating them as if they're right, until one encounters actual reason to think they're specifically wrong about something specific; trust withheld in full generality can be damaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another might be that one commonly solves this by hurting their Carissa to her breaking point such that they subsequently know what it is, and Keltham probably literally isn't capable of that yet, but the fact he's not also means this isn't very urgent.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Ah, Keltham. Carissa thinks her preferred phrasing might've been better in that regard but yields to Abrogail's superior Splendour. It's like - it's like if the thing you're trying to do is figure out who to send on patrol, and if someone brings up that those two just had a bad breakup and won't get along, your job isn't convincing them they're <em>wrong</em>, it's <em>figuring out what the best patrol group is with the new inputs</em>. Act like the decision power is already yours and you don't need to convince anyone, and then like you need the patrol to nonetheless perform well against demons.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One objection to what Abrogail just said is that it proves too much, Keltham shouldn't buy and abuse literal children (yes he should but they're not going to get him there yet). So it might be worth acknowledging his concerns as perhaps outweighing her clever response in some cases, but pointing out that Carissa was judged competent by her society to swear the Worldwound oath, which is as competent as her society is capable of acknowledging her to be, and so even if one doesn't want to declare everyone competent until proven otherwise they could extend it at least to those who've served at the Lawfullest place in Golarion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(Modulo carefulness to not come across as too good at reading Keltham, but Abrogail knows that.)</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(She's...better at self-deception than most people, it's pretty obvious by now; her self-deceptions go deeper, grow more roots. She didn't just learn to quash the thought 'Abrogail makes mistakes', she uprooted everything nearby, replaced with 'you are too ignorant of the constraints on Abrogail to ever evaluate anything she does as a mistake'.)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Carissa has only tried being emotional at Keltham once and what happened was that he decided he needed to invent contraception about her sadness, it was very confusing, Isidre should be glad he's not handling Isidre's emotions like that. Maybe dath ilan encourages that because they don't want their people emotionally manipulable and also don't want them to learn to simply not care about other people.</p>

            <p>Also, if Keltham is feeling meaningfully constrained by fear Carissa will walk out, well, that's precisely why some people like to put that decision, too, in his hands, so that he can use reasoning processes that aren't meant for situations where the other person might get fed up and walk away. Uh, that came out too influenced by dath ilan, translate before you say it.</p>

            <p>"My Carissamodel says that it is basically not possible to steal Carissa from me by pathway two - that there's no realistic amount of pleasure you can get from sex toys and without dangerous drugs that you can use to steal a Carissa from a Keltham.&nbsp; I nonetheless check explicitly that you agree with my Carissamodel there."</p>

            <p>If the fundamental reason why Carissa prefers Keltham&nbsp;<em>is that Keltham will never statue her,</em> and then Abrogail kidnaps Carissa for purposes of slow yet ultimately fake petrification, and afterward swears never to do that to her (barring deliberate betrayal etc) -</p>
