            <p>"I'll file a request to get you a copy," he says wearily.&nbsp; He can't actually afford to offend Sevar, she picked up some of his own backlog earlier.&nbsp; "You can also write the request and I'll sign it, if you want it to go out earlier."</p>
            <p>This is Inner-Ring-speak for <em>I acknowledge you did some of my work earlier, you get to exercise some of my power, under my supervision of course, to encourage you to go on doing it.</em>&nbsp; Dangerous sort of thing to indicate, in the Inner Ring; but it would, in fact, at least for now, be helpful to make more use of Sevar.&nbsp; If she can decode the message at all.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>She gets that there's something she's being asked to get. Which is dangerous, if you aren't precisely sure you've translated it correctly. But it's - not a hostile move, because it was an offer - "I'll write it," she says coolly, her face neutral. "I'd like it to come in before I return to Keltham."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She puzzles the rest of it out while she writes. Non-hostile, and in fact very slightly generous; her getting something she wants and doesn't really strictly need, faster. Does he want to be owed a favor - no, she's owed one, for doing the project work earlier, even though she did that for the project not for him - well, obviously they're not doing anything out of generosity for each other, but she was a more useful project collaborator, and so, a minor benefit from it. Why tell her she can write it herself, rather than that he'll write it at the top of the queue for her? He can't be <em>that&nbsp;</em>tired. Maybe something in the genre of - the reward for a job well done is more of a job - you want to do some of my work, you may do it for your benefit - yep, that feels closer to right -</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Contessa Lrilatha, addressed with appropriate courtesy, has a copy of a contract she wrote and to which Sevar has placed her signature in the course of Sevar's work on Project Lawful. Sevar requires it so that she knows to what she has bound herself. If she is expected to have difficulty noticing it, key bits could be underlined.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"I don't know if you got to this in your stack yet," she says, handing it to Maillol, "but I did not intend to make Contessa Lrilatha and Gorthoklek and the Grand High Priestess and Her Imperial Majestry all wait for me, understand my error, and if there's not a punishment code in there already will expect one from the Queen when Keltham hands me over. Other than that, the meeting went well."</p>

            <p>Maillol, when he angered that same group of people, came back worse. There's not actually a way around that conclusion. He is worse. That's not how punishment is supposed to work but evidently it is in the range of mistakes that Cheliax is capable of making. And she can't afford to get worse; she needs to get stronger as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Maybe she can propose to the Queen that she be sent to Hell for however long it's going to need to be. Cheliax has a lot of diamonds, now.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Nothing much at all has happened to Asmodia in the last few hours, by Hell's standards; and of the two events that did happen to her, neither were awful.&nbsp; Well, she doesn't know who owns her soul, anymore, that's a little unnerving.&nbsp; But also - it shouldn't matter, right, if she can figure out what she needs to do to buy an eternity of this, and do it.&nbsp; Or if whoever cares about her, goes on caring.</p>
            <p>Asmodia feels stronger, now, knowing that good things can ever happen to her, and that someone somewhere might even care.&nbsp; Maybe the 100 years aren't a threat, a week would be a threat.&nbsp; 100 years could just be a message:&nbsp; Go back, you still have something to do, please, I lent you a hand, lend me one too.</p>
            <p>She's not looking forwards to Cheliax, it's too much like Hell.&nbsp; But she'll face it, for that, whether she's buying her eternal peace from a broker, or just paying back somebody who cares.</p>

            <p>That's half the problem, right, all these people hear that they're not authorized to mindread the Project Lawful girls, or to punish them, or even to smack fucking Pilar in her fucking face when she offers then cake, so then things grow out of all proportion and they think the girls are something special.</p>
            <p>People are&nbsp;<em>sneakily lingering&nbsp;</em>around where the resurrections are happening, hoping to get a glimpse of Asmodia. Haven't they got something better to do with their time than drool over a bunch of halfwitted wizard children that were&nbsp;<em>meant&nbsp;</em>to just be a&nbsp;<em>nice welcoming present&nbsp;</em>for Keltham, and which ideally would&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>be chained up in his room right now.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br>Whatever.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>He tells them they can stay if they go invisible, because obviously he's not going to ask her any secret questions aloud, and if they want to gawk at this completely normal teenager and owe him a favor for it afterwards, why not.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>"All right, you piece of shit, let's be clear about a couple of things. First thing, if you have a secret the fact of which also needs to be secret, you can communicate that by Messaging that you need to be alone, or by asking to go to the temple for your debrief, or by saying 'debrief may cover highly classified materials, ask the project head if you're the person to do it', or by exercising literally any initiative whatsoever. I'm not going to rip you apart for that, because I didn't expect any better, but that's how it's done, among people who aren't&nbsp;<em>catastrophically stupid.</em></p>
            <p>Second. If you have a secret the fact of which also need to be secret, you don't just randomly volunteer potentially-relevant information to a large group of strangers for no reason. I am going to guess, wildly, with only my intelligence which is apparently at least double yours, that your devil dying <em>might have had something to do with </em>this very secret secret. Which they are destroying people, in Hell, to protect. If a secret is important enough to destroy devils over, it's&nbsp;<em>probably&nbsp;</em>important enough to say in a&nbsp;<em>whisper</em>, or in a Message, or by&nbsp;<em>passing a note,&nbsp;</em>or by waiting until we got out of the room, because I was very evidently avoiding doing a real debrief until we got out of the room. Instead of any of those things, you opened your stupid fucking mouth, you worthless fucking idiot. I did actually expect you to be slightly less stupid than that because you somehow survived to adulthood, and I&nbsp;<em>repent of my error."</em></p>

            <p>What if we're doing this wrong. Not Hell, Hell isn't doing this wrong, but what if Cheliax in its effort to imitate Hell is, what if they're as far off Asmodeus's vision as Osirion is off Abadar's - because the latter is easy to see from the outside, easy to see how the prejudices of the people who started the project shaped what they were capable of understanding when their god said it.</p>

            <p>She walks back towards the temple.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The worst case scenario, unless she offends the Queen, is just that she'll be tortured a lot and that doesn't seem as helpful as it's supposed to be but it also doesn't exactly damage her, it can't even get her lack of feelings about Keltham to stick.</p>

            <p>Asmodia is not sure what to do about this, but, for now, nobody is hurting her, and she has a refuge to run to if she truly needs it, and in Golarion a nice room -</p>
            <p>Wait.&nbsp; She's been assigned a personal private room of her very own in the Imperial Palace, even with Pilar right next door, and her own room is obviously large enough for four people if they share the bed.</p>
            <p>And when she came back, the whole room was full of invisible people.&nbsp; And there was <em>a message from the CROWN asking if she had any superpowers, she should probably have focused a bit more on that part, it seems possibly important.</em></p>
            <p>"I have no idea what's going on right now," Asmodia says out loud.&nbsp; "I don't suppose anybody in Security is there and listening and would like to hear my report about a whole lot of people acting very strange?"<br><br></p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>The palace refectory nearest the outer palace temple is quite a lot nicer than the canteen in Project Lawful's old villa site, with a variety of high-quality-food smells on par with the nicest restaurant in Corentyn that her father deigned to take her to once per year, to show her what wealth could buy for her in the way of pride if she ever lived up to her promise.&nbsp; The Continual Lights that illuminate it are warm enough to see the food, but aside from that the decor is definitely a great deal more doompunk than the Corentyn restaurant aspired to be.</p>
            <p>It's mostly priests here up to third-circle, a scattering of nobles, nobody who obviously looks like a Security.</p>
            <p>They don't&nbsp;<em>exactly</em> all hush as she enters like Abrogail Thrune walked into the room, because what actually has to happen is a rapid propagation of people whispering "Carissa Sevar" to people who don't know that, who then stop whatever they're saying and glance in her direction before hurriedly turning back to resume their conversation in quieter tones.</p>
            <p>So there isn't a sudden silence, just a conversation that enters a slowly troughing lull as more and more people glance at her, falling silent, and then start speaking again but quieter.&nbsp; Afterwards there are a lot more faces at tables that happen to be turned in Carissa Sevar's direction coincidentally.&nbsp; And others that are very determinedly looking down at their food and definitely not looking straight at her.</p>
            <p>It sure is one heck of a shirt.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>She burns a Fox's Cunning. She's aware that she's using practically all her spell slots for intelligence enhancement these days, and that she's doing it despite having a headband that makes Fox's Cunning not even as good. She feels fine with this. It feels correct, about a Carissa Sevar capable of pulling this off, that she spends practically all her time tugging her brain into smarter configurations. Maybe some of the habits will stick.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- an incidental solution to a different problem occurs to her. She should have a collar commissioned for herself, as a present to Keltham, that stops her from refusing him. Since, after all, he told her not to. If she presents it to him with enough genuine delight and pride she doesn't think he'll have the nerve to say that actually he wants her to be capable of refusing him and actively choosing not to do it. He seems to know he shouldn't say that to her. ...there's some details to work out but it's a promising general approach.</p>
            <p>These people know who she is, and think she's important and dangerous. That's - well, first of all, that's not ideal, since the project is supposed to be a secret. Probably the fact that she's on a very secret project has spread, somehow - maybe also the fact that the Queen wants her -</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Asmodia said she had a message to Carissa from a devil who was now dead -</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- the devil she tried to sell her soul to knew her name. He had instructions about Carissa Sevar. It wouldn't have been left up to chance whether a summoned devil knew her name, not for something that important. So all the contract devils in Cheliax knew to do something different than their usual, if presented with Carissa Sevar. Maybe that's how people here know about her; they're in regular communication with Hell, and in Hell people know who she is. Almost no one ever comes to Asmodeus's direct attention, the devil told her. Why didn't she take that more seriously? She only half believed it, but even so.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(Idea: stop half-believing things. You're either right or wrong, and either one has implications. Keltham doesn't half-believe a thing.)</p>
            <p>(Further idea: <em>eat</em>. That's what you came here for.)</p>
            <p>She shouldn't really have needed a Fox's Cunning for that last idea. She approaches the food line like she didn't overthink this at&nbsp;<em>all.</em></p>

            <p>"My best attempt to filter through the lot and reconstruct something that could have plausibly happened:&nbsp; An ordinary weapons enchanter, stationed at the Worldwound, received a vision from Asmodeus directing them to find some manner of mini-Starstone, which empowers people in several ways.&nbsp; One of those includes bypassing Forbiddances in order to move about cake slices, books, and, in a much more important case, diamonds.&nbsp; You need to give the cake to somebody who'll eat it, or give the book to somebody who'll read it, the ability can't be used that freely.&nbsp; The mini-Starstone bestows powerful auras that may not match true alignments, but are sufficient to change afterlife destinations.&nbsp; It may grant minor cleric spells and magical detection.&nbsp; I do not, presently, buy the claim that seeing the future is included among bestowed powers, since if that were possible at all, the gods would still have it.&nbsp; The initial group of subjects exposed to it were graduating students at Ostenso's wizard academy."</p>
            <p>"The mini-Starstone either fails to empower men who touch it, or turns them into women. &nbsp;It makes people more physically ideal and perfected, over time; which is why you, as the first person to touch it, are now the prettiest of this very noticeably pretty group; and, according to at least one rumor, have become visibly prettier over the last few days."</p>
            <p>"I admit, I'd given less credence to the turns-into-women theory, and probably wouldn't have mentioned it at all, if you weren't wearing an obviously-magical-looking man's shirt that no longer fits you.&nbsp; Not that I'd hold that against you, if you're not exclusive with Abrogail."&nbsp; He smiles in a way that makes it very clear that this is supposed to be a complete joke, or at least, deniable as such.&nbsp; "Oh, and your project manager is a complete fuckup but I don't think anyone has actually deduced what the details were."</p>

            <p>We matter far, far more right now than we will in Hell. If Asmodeus could in destroying all our future potential for Him make us better servants of Him right here and right now, I think He obviously would; in Hell there are millions of souls like us, but here and now we are the&nbsp;<em>only people who can do&nbsp;</em>the most important thing that there is to be done. I am not interested in our long-term spiritual improvement. I have not adopted some kind of heretical belief that punishment is bad for us, in the long run; it is good for us, in the long run, which isn't our priority at all. I have not adopted some kind of heretical belief that it is bad for people to suffer unless they grow from it; if this directive works better paired with some directive to round up a bunch of orphans and torture them, I'll do that, or delegate it if that's allowed because I am&nbsp;<em>kind of busy.&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p>I have a theory, which is that punishment is in the short term particularly bad for the kind of acuity needed to succeed at this project, and I need this project to succeed, so I want everyone to <em>stop torturing my project members&nbsp;</em>without reason to think it will&nbsp;<em>make the project likelier to succeed.</em></p>
            <p>Exception for myself, because I don't think any justification short of Asmodeus personally saying so would protect me now, and I don't want there to be any question of whether I conveniently developed this conviction when facing down something I know I can't handle. Exception for Pilar, because as noted, she likes it. Exception for one random girl at the villa because everything is an eye, and if the girl who still gets punished normally is performing well then we'll go back on this. It's how Evil dath ilan would do it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I don't care about any of you, but I need to be able to use you if I'm going to win. You need to be better than Cheliax knows how to make people. And it needs to happen fast. So we try this."</p>

            <p>He probably should have thought it out earlier.&nbsp; If he wanted to win this, he is far worse off trying to win this fight starting now, than if he'd set up his pieces for this conflict starting after the first moment he'd tried giving Sevar a taste of power.</p>
            <p>Can he take her, if he contests her control of the project right now?&nbsp; It's not at all clear that he can.&nbsp; Yesterday he could've, at the villa where he was running everything and had all the reports.&nbsp; Today he's in the Palace, where he's that pathetic guy who got tortured by Gorthoklek, and Sevar has now met the Queen and her advisers.&nbsp; Paper lines of power count for a lot in a tyranny, but not for everything, not among the Inner Ring.&nbsp; It's not entirely clear that the Security would obey him if Ferrer Maillol ordered Sevar cut down on the spot.&nbsp; This Security isn't one of the older Security from the villa; this Security knows Carissa Sevar only as a Power at least on Ferrer Maillol's level, who always has been such.</p>
            <p>Does he&nbsp;<em>want</em> to take down Sevar, does he want to fight back at all, would he rather just let her have it?&nbsp; Maybe that question should've come first, but if he can't take her, it's a moot one.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodia is sitting in her peaceful, lovely bedroom in the Imperial palace at Egorian.&nbsp; It is not the gardens of Erecura, and the main thing that makes it different is not that the gardens are nicer-looking or the air is fresher, it is that the gardens are, so far as she can tell,&nbsp;<em>safe,</em> whereas the Imperial palace at Egorian is not safe.&nbsp; It can have the quality of not hurting you right now; it cannot have the quality of being guaranteed to still not be hurting you a few minutes later.</p>
            <p>But she knows where to find safety, for a time, if she needs it.&nbsp; Maybe somebody would be nice to her again 100 years later, maybe not; but what comes after 100 years hardly feels like it would still be real, still be this Asmodia who makes the choice...</p>
            <p>She keeps on reviewing what she knows.&nbsp; Maybe if she knew all that Keltham knew, as well as her own knowledge, she'd be able to figure it out; but she can't.&nbsp; The shadows got her, she was revived in the Imperial Palace, she's next to Pilar so the project is probably still active.</p>
            <p>The gardens were peaceful except for two events.&nbsp; First, the disorienting sensation that, she was informed, not by Erecura this time, had been the sensation of her contract devil being destroyed and her soul being passed to whoever inherited it from him.&nbsp; She'd figured, at the time, that he'd either asked too many questions about the Keltham project, or it was the Carissa Sevar thing.</p>
            <p>Later, she'd been called closer to the center of Erecura's gardens, closer to Erecura Herself in the fullest place of Her power within Her home plane, and the seal on her thoughts had been placed in full.&nbsp; Asmodia can't remember it well; she probably didn't originally experience it well, never mind memory.</p>
            <p>When she'd woken - it apparently being possible to fall unconscious in Hell under <em>sufficiently</em> extreme circumstances - she'd known the rules.&nbsp; How to put thoughts <em>about the existence of the seal,</em> but not the&nbsp;<em>contents of the seal,</em> temporarily outside of the seal and readable.&nbsp; That if she needed to report defiance of the seal, she should go to the most senior outsider under Asmodeus, but <em>not</em> any archdevil or other being reporting directly to Him; and that she was forbidden, by Asmodeus's own Law, to pray to Asmodeus or turn her thoughts too much in His direction, while the seal lasted.</p>
            <p>(No, she is not allowed to ask Aspexia Rugatonn what happened.&nbsp; Not that she would, but it doesn't matter, it's not allowed.)</p>
            <p>And she's been assigned her own room at the Palace, with a bed large enough to sleep four.&nbsp; There was a Crown order on checking her for new or exotic special abilities, which has now been returned with a <em>false </em>answer that she has none.&nbsp; There were way too many invisible people watching her when she came back.&nbsp; Sevar was acting weird, asking weird questions that were almost like she knew the secret but didn't quite, and in other ways acting like she doesn't know what's going on around her any more than Asmodia does.</p>
            <p>Around the only thing in the universe that still remains stable and true is that Abarco is a giant fucking asshole.</p>
            <p>The main thing Asmodia is currently worried about is whether Abarco is right and her devil <em>was</em> destroyed to keep the Secret.&nbsp; She found out that the devil was destroyed, before she found out there was a Secret, so all the explanations she thought up, had nothing to do with what happened to her being Secret.&nbsp; But in retrospect maybe there was always going to be a Secret and she just found out about it later.&nbsp; She shouldn't have mentioned the devil being destroyed.&nbsp; Too late now.&nbsp; Not that she'll ever tell Abarco he was right about anything, and he won't see it in her thoughts, either.</p>
            <p>Asmodia knows what she has to do next, to figure things out, it's all too obvious, she just wanted to keep to her peace for as long as she could before...</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You were&nbsp;<em>on</em> Project Lawful, right?&nbsp; From the start<em>.</em>&nbsp; If I can't tell&nbsp;<em>you</em> -"</p>
            <p>"You'll what, talk at somebody else?&nbsp; You know what, <em>fine,</em> if you absolutely have to blabber to somebody about whatever this is, I suppose it does less damage with me than anyone else."&nbsp; It is his considered opinon that the average Security assigned to safe temple jobs inside the Imperial Palace are noticeably less elite than those assigned to top-secret projects started by divine intervention.&nbsp; Which, in fact, makes sense, but.&nbsp; But.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "So I was the Security in Ferrer Maillol's office when Carissa Sevar walked in on him, and tried to hand him a new policy for the whole Project.&nbsp; I probably shouldn't repeat the exact proposal, but it was <em>six</em> kinds of heretical, and to be clear, she wasn't phrasing it as a suggestion."</p>
            <p>"...you have my attention," he says reluctantly.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And Maillol protests, obviously, how heretical this is, and Sevar stares him down coldly and says, yes, I know it's heretical, but Asmodeus doesn't give a shit about what condition our souls end up in afterwards, <em>Asmodeus wants us to win.</em>&nbsp; So this is your new project directive."</p>
            <p>"And how'd Maillol take that?"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Looks silently at Sevar for a while, then says he's not taking responsibility for implementing that directive when it's actually hers.&nbsp; He offers to write her a note to Aspexia Rugatonn asking for an urgent conversation about whether Sevar's in charge of Project Lawful or he is.&nbsp; He's happy to serve under her if ordered, but if she doesn't come back with orders saying she's in charge and holding responsibility on the project, he expects Sevar to shut up and obey him in the future."</p>
            <p>"And Sevar?"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Just says 'understood', takes the note from him, and heads off, presumably to talk to the Grand High Priestess."</p>
            <p>"Lovely.&nbsp; I concede that makes a great story, and now you've told it to me and you never tell it to anyone again and it doesn't get added to the rumor firestorm, clear?"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You're not going to die if you admit out loud how badass that was."</p>
            <p>"Yes, <em>fine</em>, it was badass, now, are we <em>done?</em>"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "It was&nbsp;<em>incredibly&nbsp;</em>badass.&nbsp; Not a lot of people would be willing to just completely stare down Carissa Sevar like that."</p>
            <p>Paving stones.&nbsp; Hell needs more paving stones.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In some sense the entire aim of Project Lawful is to produce Aspexia Rugatonns reliably. She's Asmodean, obviously, can't get more Asmodean, and she's - admittedly Carissa has only heard her speak a few times, but she's heard people speak of her more than that -</p>
            <p>she thinks Aspexia Rugatonn might&nbsp;<em>be&nbsp;</em>Evil dath ilani. Or at least much closer than anyone else. But, obviously, Aspexia Rugatonn is not competent to train Aspexia Rugatonns; she must herself have ended up like that halfway by accident, with felt insights she can't share. More fragments of the Law inside her than inside anyone else but still not rules-bound enough she could teach them. At minimum Aspexia Rugatonn is proof that it's possible to reason like Keltham and reason about how the gods reason and not end up a heretic.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If Aspexia Rugatonn thinks this specific policy is bad, Carissa will drop it. If Aspexia Rugatonn thinks Carissa is thinking about this all wrong, she'll listen. She doesn't think she's magically the best person around for the project, she knows that many people are better than her, she knows that the Grand High Priestess would be better than her, but the Grand High Priestess doesn't have time. They don't have ten of her, yet.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I can give you ten.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She isn't sure it's true, but she's sure it'd be a winning argument, if she could, in fact, do it.</p>

            <p>Rugatonn glances around, spots Sevar, and frowns.</p>
            <p>"When were you planning to tell me Carissa Sevar was waiting on me?" she says to her emotionless-appearing secretary.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I was not informed that I should interrupt -"</p>
            <p>"Whether you interrupt me depends on who I'm with, but if Sevar shows up in my office I at least expect to be notified between appointments."</p>
            <p>Rugatonn turns to Sevar.&nbsp; "Step inside," she says, her voice no less stern and harsh than would be expected of the Grand High Priestess, even when talking to Carissa Sevar.</p>

The floor and walls are reflective, glossy black stone; Aspexia's side of her desk has a thick carpet and cheerfully blazing braziers and looks almost comfortable, but the other side does not.</p>

            <p><em>I was not aware at the time of your agreement with the Queen to owe her an informal favor about her lost pride.&nbsp; I have informed the Queen that any such favor should be considered to be partially owed by myself, rather than you, to the extent she lost any more pride than she otherwise would have done, in that particular moment.&nbsp; My apologies for that element of it, if not others.</em></p>

Keltham will probably be incredibly confused, but he's already treating etiquette as a fairly absurd social game, and he's not wrong to.&nbsp; She...thinks he'll just buy that the Grand High Priestess was meddling out of appreciation for young love, and it'll fit his impression of senior Chelish leadership as excessively Good people with excessively powerful headbands, which - is convenient until cracks start showing... and possibly safer to attribute to Isidre than to the Grand High Priestess.&nbsp;</p>

Even though once she chases the thought down - yes, obviously, Asmodeus isn't omniscient - and she has no idea whether He ever makes&nbsp;<em>mistakes given what he knows </em>but the important thing from the perspective of his servants is that He might not intend the effects of things He does, or might be missing key information -</p>
            <p>- right, okay -</p>

            <p>So far, things have worked out well for Cheliax and Asmodeus. They have locked away Asmodeus's competitor; they are in the middle of conquering Nidal, the first meaningful territorial expansion of Asmodean Cheliax. They have all Nidal's diamonds, and will come out of the war richer than they started it, not to mention with most of their casters strengthened. Honestly in the Grand High Priestess's place she'd be tempted to declare they should stop while ahead and kill everyone, except Otolmens instructed that Keltham be contained, and probably there are all kinds of people chomping at the bit to raise him.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>What does Nethys want. Almost unanswerable. He did warn them of Nidal's attack. He likes magic and explosions. There'll be lots of explosions if Keltham teaches Cheliax the weaponry of his world. Maybe Nethys thinks Cheliax is competent to prevent Keltham from destroying the world while allowing him the chance to advance the field by thousands of years. Maybe Nethys is trying to explode Cheliax.</p>
            <p>What do the tropes want. For Keltham to have an interesting sex life, Keltham thinks, for the holes that his Lawful Good society left in him to be filled, for him to realize his shape isn't an error. Maybe Keltham being seduced into Evil is satisfactory to the tropes.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>She should have noticed faster that she was confused by all Asmodeus's unAsmodean instructions. No, that's not quite fair to herself, she noticed it was weird, and drew conclusions - specifically it's how she concluded Asmodeus cared more about their succeeding than their being Asmodean. Backtrace, now. You don't know the reason why. Asmodeus is giving unAsmodean instructions. It's not because He has changed his mind. It's -</p>

            <p>"He and Abadar - or He and Irori - have a deal? Most High?" It has not escaped Carissa that Irori might be involved in the effort to bring a more perfect person to Golarion and that this might be why she was warned not to think herself too like Irori.</p>

            <p>"It may be that our Lord would will these events to continue if He knew of them, it may be that He would have them stop. &nbsp;If it is to my Lord's interests that these intricate events He could not have arranged Himself, continue to occur, then I can only work His will, in that case, by not disturbing them.&nbsp; If I disturb them against His will, He will be realistically unable to tell me how to put them back on track even with a hundred visions and a thousand messages from Hell."</p>
            <p>"If He wants it all shut down, one vision or one communication from Hell would suffice.&nbsp; I would not ordinarily reason so, for <em>every</em> divine intervention is greatly costly to Him; I dare not imagine what other opportunities He has foregone, in this place or in others, for the sake of all this.&nbsp; But here - He is intervening over and over."</p>
            <p>"To make myself easy to control, across both cases of what my Lord could plausibly desire of me, I will allow this to continue unless my Lord tells me to stop, and pray that He is, indeed, paying that much attention."</p>
            <p>"I am not going to refrain from having your feelings corrected at all, especially if it happens in a very predictable and Asmodean way in a particular case.&nbsp; But having this strange entanglement shut down by hammering those feelings out of you - that I will not do.&nbsp; Yet."</p>
            <p>"Now, Sevar, do you think you are able to know all this, without that tempting you to do <em>ridiculously complicated and unpredictable things</em> in order to, as you imagine it, keep the plans of the gods on the track you imagine they were supposed to be on?"</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Why would she be tempted to do ridiculously complicated and unpredictable things that would make it harder for Asmodeus to follow what's going on?</p>
            <p>...probably what the Grand High Priestess means is that many normal human things are ridiculously complicated and unpredictable to Asmodeus so by default she'll be ridiculously complicated and unpredictable if she hasn't had explicit training in how to narrow her actions to the set that don't have that property. Evil dath ilani are probably so good at this.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Without having had that training -</p>
            <p>- what examples does she have of things that are complicated and unpredictable. Humor.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Hives of ridiculous rumormongering.</span> Keltham's experiments being deployed in the world. Sending Alexite Gellius Rutilus Thrune to the Worldwound because it'd be good for him. (She wasn't really going to do that, though, she just had fun thinking of it.) All of those feel too obvious, all of those would also be hard to predict for a human overseeing the project.....</p>
            <p>"What errors will I make, what ways of clouding things for Asmodeus will I fall into, if I am <em>only </em>trying to avoid doing things that'd be surprising or unpredictable to <em>you&nbsp;</em>and failing to take into account the ways in which Asmodeus is in predicting me more limited?"</p>

            <p>The parchment grants Carissa Sevar authority and responsibility over <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Project Pet Outsider</span> Project Lawful, with Ferrer Maillol answering to her as chief operations officer and commanding if she cannot, with Sevar herself answerable to a seventh-circle priest of Asmodeus who will reside on-site.</p>
            <p>At the bottom are also some rather severe punishment codes for Carissa Sevar, not to be undergone for at least a week and delayable for up until two months after that.&nbsp; Those however have now been crossed out, in the same ink that wrote the signature.</p>

            <p>(This about Pilar Pineda:&nbsp; She walks through Cheliax a lot less nervously than others.&nbsp; It's fine and proper if she's punished fairly, and even an unfair punishment isn't so terrible.&nbsp; Her loyalty to Lord Asmodeus is, if not absolute, strong enough for her to feel <em>pretty confident</em> in it.&nbsp; If Pilar says anything that <em>sounds</em> questionable, anyone who checks her loyalty will discover that she is thinking all the proper things under Detect Thoughts.&nbsp; It's fine for Pilar to say that she'd rather not learn about Chaotic Good, because any superior who rounds on her for that will find Pilar humbly saying that of course she'd do it if ordered, she'd never dream of not following orders.&nbsp; Scan Pilar as you like with Detect Thoughts, you will find that she is absolutely sincere about that, and not in the way of somebody having to suppress a lot of thoughts either.&nbsp; Cheliax is safe for her, and if she is executed there, she gets to go home.)</p>
