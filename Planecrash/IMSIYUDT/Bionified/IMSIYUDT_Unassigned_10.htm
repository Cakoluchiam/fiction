The natural default mode for exploring is more - cautious, giggly, childlike, and that is appealing in its own way - maybe to Keltham too - but not sexy, and she's going to be kind of dissatisfied if -</p>
            <p>- one thing at a time. The massive entryhall staircase opens out onto a luxurious mezzanine and then there are two wings with rooms, presumably parlors and bedrooms and guest rooms and so on, and no obvious staircase up, though she knows that this place has some towers.

            <p>"I can flirt with people who have - magic items for it, can read your face so closely they might as well be able to read your mind, who have magic that does more than Splendour - I have done that, though not very much, because I tried not to get in over my head, at the Worldwound, there wasn't anything there worth getting in over my head for - but I want you, see, you think like no one in this universe and it feels - possible that I could think like that too, not after the centuries of perfecting it'll take me to be Contessa Lrilatha but, like, next year, sooner if I can squeeze a headband out of somebody, and - <em>I want you</em>, so you don't actually have to be good at flirting, unless you yourself get in the mood by flirting deftly at people, in which case I suppose you had better get good at it."</p>

            <p>She will die horribly if she turns Keltham against Cheliax. Anything that's true of all Golarion isn't that, and she's pretty sure that nowhere in Golarion do powerful men want the women they're sleeping with to communicate needing things to happen differently.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She will die horribly and worse afterwards if she ends up wholly persuaded of Keltham's worldview and not suitable as an instrument of Hell anymore. But her first foolish foray into Keltham's worldview was, Asmodeus thought, worthwhile, so - maybe she has a bit of slack there, presumably he wouldn't have expended those resources for someone who couldn't find the right path even when she was trying. And she hasn't gone and asked the cleric her questions yet. Maybe it's okay to try to understand the dath ilan way of thinking and separately try to understand the Asmodean one and then integrate them. If she can't understand dath ilan she won't be able to do her job.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Keltham will at some point figure stuff out - not all the stuff, but some stuff. He's already figured some things out just from the fact Chelish students conceal distress during class. The ideas that look right next to each other, to him, are different; they won't be able to predict which things are right next to other things unless they get really good at dath ilan-ness themselves. To him, 'people smile during class' was right next to 'you might not actually want to be here', not that he has the imagination to have realized the&nbsp;<em>ways&nbsp;</em>she might be here if she didn't want to be.</p>
            <p>It feels like there are walls closing in from all sides, and -</p>
            <p>"Might someone consult a Keeper?" she says. "If they were dath ilani and very stuck and very confused even about the origins of their own confusion."</p>

            <p>Compared to instructions relayed by way of Hell, a cleric who receives a direct divine revelation from Asmodeus will have received instruction that is more accurate, more precise, and much less able to be put into words for other mortals to hear.&nbsp; The project to extract extraplanar knowledge from 'Keltham' was established based in part upon a vision from Asmodeus.&nbsp; The priest who received the vision from Asmodeus reported his best guess that there was a sense that Asmodeus thought their visitor was <em>potentially valuable</em> and not just being given unexplained protections.&nbsp; What else was in the message from Asmodeus?&nbsp; Was there anything else important, not yet done?&nbsp; This tends to be very hard for recipients of visions to convey, if it is not blindingly obvious.</p>
            <p>The priest in question also headed up a Worldwound installation, was fifth-circle, and had proven himself on lesser commands.&nbsp; Placing him in command of the villa project was another obvious bet.</p>
            <p>Ferrer Maillol himself, fifth-circle cleric of Asmodeus, is not currently enjoying himself quite so much as when he was fighting an endless horde of demons at the Worldwound.&nbsp; The Worldwound did not have alien teenagers being insane, direct orders from Hell that are incredibly inexplicable, random wizard students getting oracled by Nethys, and way too many complications he is not allowed to set on fire until they shape up.&nbsp; Ferrer Maillol had not, until just today, appreciated the degree to which it is easier to fight an endless horde of demons compared to sending out a new top-priority message to Aspexia Rugatonn every hour.&nbsp; He had quietly resolved to himself that he was very seriously going to consider whether the next such message should be batched, in part to conserve his remaining supply of communication spells, and in part because he was worried about how Aspexia Rugatonn was going to take his hourly interruptions.</p>
            <p>Of course the next piece of news he got was about a fucking Otolmens event.</p>
            <p>When Ferrer Maillol is notified that Carissa Sevar wants to see the head priest, there is only one first thought which goes through his mind, which is <em>not again.</em></p>

            <p>She is going to sound like an idiot. She's just going to - ignore that and try anyway, if her idiocy is revealed then it can be corrected.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"I think dath ilani people - genuinely understand Law better than us. I think they're - mostly Lawful Good, and Keltham is Lawful Neutral, but their understanding of Law is correct in important ways we weren't going to derive ourselves, and so there is a Lawful Evil version of it. And in class, I was trying to come up with it. And then I got the communication -" she pulls out the scroll Aspexia Rugatonn gave her, reads it off so she can't be misremembering - ''Remember that you are not Irori. &nbsp;Do not think yourself likely to succeed in perfecting yourself without divine aid."</p>
            <p>"Acknowledge the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis, and accept that your rightful place is in Hell."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And I think what was being - very generously - communicated by mentioning Irori, and Axis, was that I was - borrowing too much from Keltham, who is Lawful Neutral, and that I don't truly understand the nature of Evil, and so the thing I was building wouldn't have been of any value, it would've been - missing something Asmodeus wants. But presumably I am capable of learning it or he'd just have let me get it wrong and accidentally make myself worthless. Do you...have any idea what it might be."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Ferrer Maillol's first thought is the obvious one, that he hopes this new brilliant idea of Sevar's works out better for him than her one about providing Keltham with lots of girls one of whom gets oracled by Nethys - though, of course, that wasn't her decision, and the Church of Asmodeus is not confused about who bears the real responsibility.</p>
            <p>His second thought is about a distinction he was warned about, that they've been instructed to <em>prioritize Sevar as if</em> she were Asmodeus's own fourth-circle cleric, not to <em>answer as if</em> she were one.&nbsp; It rules out the obvious answer he'd give to a fourth-circle Asmodean cleric standing nearby and asking what Sevar was missing.&nbsp; Still, Asmodeus's language to Sevar - if it wasn't just poorly translated by Hell - suggests that Sevar has the kind of soul that Asmodeus actually wants, if He can win it in this contest with Irori, or whatever is actually going on here.&nbsp; (He is not to try to guess and be helpful in a way that pushes the edges of Hell's orders; the Grand High Priestess was quite clear on that.)</p>
            <p>He will, then, answer as he might answer somebody who was considered to have enough potential that Asmodeus might choose them to be a cleric, perhaps, though not yet chosen; or as he might answer a promising heiress of Chelish nobility.</p>
            <p>"People in Cheliax register as Lawful and as Evil, and worship no Lawful Evil god other than Asmodeus or his subordinates.&nbsp; This suffices for much of Asmodeus's purpose, as it brings those souls to Hell's standard gate, which Asmodeus has already conquered, and so into His ownership for further refinement.&nbsp; We do not ask most people to understand what Lawful Evil really is, let alone what would distinguish Asmodeus from Zon-Kuthon within Lawful Evil.&nbsp; Most people do not, in fact, need to understand this.&nbsp; They do not possess the nature that marks them as potentially one of <em>Asmodeus's</em> own, instead of just the masses who must be coerced to Lawfulness out of fear and who end up registering as Evil because that is what the rules make of conducting yourself in ways not completely absurd."</p>
            <p>"<em>You</em>, Sevar, might have the potential to become one of Asmodeus's own, not just Lawful and Evil.&nbsp; Or so our Lord's instructions to you suggest.&nbsp; You are, I think, being invited to join the inner circle.&nbsp; And I am not expecting you to already understand what that truly means, because it is not something we bother trying to teach most third-circle wizards.&nbsp; So the question I am about to ask is not a test of loyalty, but a test for whether you belong in the beginner classroom or the advanced one.&nbsp; What have you already grasped, if anything, of the difference between Lawful Evil and Asmodeanism?&nbsp; What makes Cheliax an Asmodean country and not just a Lawful Evil one?"</p>

            <p>She has never considered the question before but she is a day of dath ilan better at thinking than anyone else in Cheliax and would like to show it, ideally. "The part of that which sounds easiest is the difference between Asmodeus and Zon-Kuthon," she says. "Zon Kuthon - intrinsically values suffering more, I think? If everyone in the universe were, uh, constantly being creatively tortured, Zon Kuthon would be entirely pleased by that. And Hell ruled by Asmodeus isn't like that - there'd lots of torture, but there is - the opportunity to not be tortured, the opportunity to be such a high performer that you are satisfactory - the opportunity to be doing the torturing, the opportunity to be deciding who is tortured - Asmodeus wants.... some features of Hell other than the suffering - I mean, in addition to the suffering, I know the suffering's important - these are guesses, maybe Asmodeus values people having the experience of - their suffering being related to qualities they have - knowing you are suffering because of your own conduct and choices, not just at unlucky random - maybe Asmodeus values people striving to avoid further torture, or some of the things they do while they're trying to avoid further torture, or, uh, them becoming more like him in becoming more the kind of entity who'd run Hell the way he runs it - maybe he values people being rewarded when they've earned it, maybe he values - earning it feels like a natural category, here, if I had to guess I would guess that Asmodeus values people earning features of their situation through their actions or their fundamental nature... uh, the strongest counterargument I can think of to that is that it's too Lawful Neutral again? 'to each their just rewards' is not right, as a description of Asmodeus. But there are other ways for there to be a relationship between your actions and what happens to you."</p>

            <p>"The primary domains of Asmodeus are tyranny, slavery, compacts, and pride.&nbsp; Tyranny is not just rulership.&nbsp; Slavery is not just obedience.&nbsp; Compacts are not just deals.&nbsp; Pride is not just having a high opinion of yourself."</p>
            <p>"For Zon Kuthon, the object of torture is torture.&nbsp; For Asmodeus, the object of torture is not only the benefit Asmodeus gains when people obey.&nbsp; The object of torture is that Cheliax be a <em>tyranny, </em>not just a farm from which Asmodeus extracts a maximum yield of wheat.&nbsp; Tyranny, as Asmodeus sees it, requires <em>tyrants,</em> not just a single decider at the top, but deciders all through the system who enforce obedience with whip and pain.&nbsp; He is a&nbsp;<em>Lawful</em> Evil god, the tyrants are there to enforce&nbsp;<em>rules</em> and not just to do as they please, they are subject to rules themselves."</p>
            <p>"We are taught - we, Asmodeus's own clerics, not the common people - that Asmodeus holds the key of Rovagug's prison, fitting a lock that Abadar made so that Asmodeus alone could open it.&nbsp; Why Asmodeus?&nbsp; Because Asmodeus alone can be trusted by Pharasma that, even after He conquers every plane and every part of reality, Asmodeus will never seek to displace Pharasma Herself.&nbsp; Pharasma is the one who made the rules that send people to the Hell that Asmodeus governs.&nbsp; Because Pharasma exists, Asmodeus is just enforcing the rules that She made, when He tortures a soul in Hell, He is being Lawful Evil and not just Evil, He is being tyrannical and not just sadistic.&nbsp; Asmodeus is the one god who cannot exist as Himself without a Pharasma above Him to set Him in place and define the system He enforces, and that was why He alone is entrusted to hold Rovagug's key.&nbsp; He, too, is only following His orders, each time He receives a new soul into Hell's embrace."</p>
            <p>"The language we are speaking is ill-suited to such distinctions, because mortals are ill-suited to understanding them, and you should not read too much into how we mortals flail for one mortal concept or another. &nbsp;To Asmodeus, to a greater devil, the shape of the meaning is precise.&nbsp; There are many souls in Cheliax who would rather hold the whip themselves, than be the one whipped.&nbsp; That does not make them Asmodean, it makes them selfish.&nbsp; There are many souls in Cheliax who would enjoy holding the whip, because they are sadists, because they delight in causing others pain and crushing them below.&nbsp; That doesn't make them Asmodeus's rather than Zon-Kuthon's.&nbsp; But some souls in Cheliax enjoy holding the whip more when they are doing it to <em>enforce the rules,</em> you might even say that they&nbsp;<em>need</em> there to be rules and&nbsp;<em>need</em> there to be some higher tyrant above them so that they are being more than just sadists.&nbsp; If those souls have enough potential to be worth empowering, Asmodeus chooses them for His own, to be His cleric, and grants to them His domain of tyranny."</p>
            <p>"To delight in tyranny is not mandatory to be one of Asmodeus's own.&nbsp; The devil you met this day may have had no joy in tyranny, for all we know, he was not a devil who had other devils beneath him.&nbsp; But when he was mortal he must have already delighted in the compacts that Asmodeus delights in, by which the wheels of Law turn to crush one party or another to the contract beneath them.&nbsp; He was not just Lawful and Evil, but delighted in Law turned to the purposes of Evil.&nbsp; And because of that, after his death and through his suffering he was elevated and raised to the status of a greater devil, and kept that part of himself which was pleasing to Asmodeus.&nbsp; As he was one of us in his mortal life, so he is now part of the <a href="https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/">inner ring</a> in Hell."</p>
            <p>"Tyranny, not just rulership.&nbsp; Slavery, not just obedience.&nbsp; Compacts, not just deals.&nbsp; Pride, not just self-value.&nbsp; Maybe all of those will appeal to you, maybe only one, but you must have great potential for at least one - if I am not entirely mistaken about the meaning of Hell's translated will of Asmodeus, conveyed to you."</p>

            <p>"Competent natural tyrants are the most useful members of the inner circle, and we try to give every intelligent Chelish citizen a chance to enforce some rules with a whip to let them discover that tendency if they have it.&nbsp; If you rise high within this world, you will discover very rapidly that the number of competent Asmodean managers you can find to help run your operations is an extreme check on your ambitions.&nbsp; It is plausibly the limiting factor for the entire Chelish state.&nbsp; Slavemasters and lawyers are not nearly so much in demand.&nbsp; Pride tends to be expensive in multiple ways, and not just financially, so it is largely the domain of nobles or the very wealthy, who by their own nature cannot be too numerous relative to the general population.&nbsp; Outside of tyranny, then, you may lack firsthand experience with other elements of Asmodeus's domain as experienced by the insiders."</p>
            <p>"Do you wish to hear my guess about your Asmodean potentials?&nbsp; It seems to me that there is a tension between Asmodeus's instructions to me that we are to assist you if you seek instruction, and Asmodeus's instructions to you that you are to find that part of yourself.&nbsp; My own resolution of the tension would be that I should answer if you ask, because I am to concern myself with Asmodeus's instructions to myself, which say that I am to assist you, and not with weighing Asmodeus's instructions to you."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Pride is the aspect of Asmodeus that Ferrer Maillol understands the <em>least</em> well, himself.&nbsp; Which is unfortunate for him, because the greater devils all seem to possess pride in abundance; and it's a good guess that having that much feeling about yourself and your place, for Hell's tortures to perfect into precisely Asmodean pride, is part of what helps you stay yourself through Hell.&nbsp; The way in which hereditary nobles seem to end up as higher devils after their death, despite what Ferrer Maillol would privately term some severe deficits of other competence, would seem to bear this out; unless it's just the sort of unfairness in which the Tyrant so delights.</p>
            <p>He answers, then, from textbook and catechism.&nbsp; "It is, obviously, a god-concept, and not one which mortal concepts are very apt to describe.&nbsp; It may help to remember that this is a&nbsp;<em>Lawful Evil</em> domain, and many things that mortals think of with the usual word 'pride' are neither Lawful nor Evil, to say nothing of Law-that-does-Evil or Evil-that-upholds-Law.&nbsp; The Lawful aspect of Asmodean pride is that it is bound up with having a place within Asmodeus's tyranny and which that tyranny has assigned to you.&nbsp; The Evil aspect of it is that it is <em>yours</em> and you defend it and you will crush others to defend it.&nbsp; By doing this, you enforce the structures of the tyranny and keep others in their place below you, it is Evil turned to the purposes of Law.&nbsp; One seeks to climb the ranks of the tyranny, but <em>within</em> the tyranny, and by this the strong rise and the tyranny itself is strengthened."</p>
            <p>"Those with deep Asmodean senses of pride have a felt sense of the order of the universe itself being disrupted, when somebody fails to give them their due, or when people weaker than themselves seem to be raised above them.&nbsp; They are not simply defending themselves from insult, or seizing an opportunity to take somebody else's position.&nbsp; They are restoring the order of the tyranny itself, in face of the disorder that is a weak unworthy person occupying a position of power or esteem."</p>
            <p>"Do you just want to be prettier, Carissa?&nbsp; Or do you have a sense that there is an order within the universe that is offended if people weaker than you, less deserving than you, get to be pretty and you don't?"</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"Illegal doesn't begin to cover it.&nbsp; There was an immediate massive clampdown on the entire event as fast as word could be passed upward, as people saw the potential for conflict between Church and Queen over the details of how to handle it.&nbsp; The Baroness in question, who was in my own personal opinion something of an absolute idiot, seemed to feel that she'd done nothing wrong, since the cleric himself had never said that Asmodeus didn't want her to go on keeping him."</p>
            <p>"An ensuing investigation turned up the puzzling fact that this new cleric had no visible aptitude for tyrannizing others, nor for crafting slaves, nor for executing compacts, and he definitely had no visible pride.&nbsp; This, of course, made our Lord's mysterious action all the more potentially important to understand, if it was not done for any of the usual reasons."</p>
            <p>"The answer, in the end, was that the man had no aptitude for tyrannizing others - but that he felt on a truly deep level that it was right for him to be tyrannized.&nbsp; He had no aptitude as a slavemaster - but felt that it was very right and proper for him to be a slave.&nbsp; He had no aptitude for contracts - but felt that all was right with the world when his Baroness was forcing him into grossly unfair bargains in her bed-games.&nbsp; He understood the order of society that underlies pride, and saw his own place was at the bottom of it.&nbsp; This, we think, is why Asmodeus chose him, though Asmodeus made no revelations on that subject."</p>
            <p>"It is not just a lie told to the masses, if you were ever wondering about that, that Asmodeus has been known to treasure some of His possessions as things beautiful to Him in themselves, and not just for the uses that we have to Him.&nbsp; So far as we know, the man was not being very useful to Asmodeus, before or after he became His cleric.&nbsp; He had simply earned Asmodeus's favor by having a rare nature pleasing to His sight."</p>
            <p>"The bed-slave cleric was purchased for a high price, resold to a more trustworthy noble at a vastly higher price, and afterwards the Baroness in question seems to have been assassinated by no known party.&nbsp; The entire matter stays swept firmly into the corners, because if it became known, idiots would derive the wrong lesson about what nobles are allowed to do to our Lord's clerics."</p>
            <p>"I mention this in case any of your own desires lie in the opposite polarity from the vantage point that nobles usually take.&nbsp; It also shows that Asmodeus's domains can be subtle things even in their largest directions.&nbsp; You would not know all about them from hearing the four concepts listed out.&nbsp; There should be desires in you that are pleasing to our Lord and will prevent you from falling into heresy.&nbsp; You should not cast too narrow an eye when it comes to looking for those desires, I suggest.&nbsp; Asmodeus would not have given such weighty instructions if the matter was going to be simple."</p>
            <p>It is, in particular, obvious to him that Sevar may perhaps have the nature of a&nbsp;<em>slave</em> rather than a slaver, given some of the thoughts recorded in her file. &nbsp;Ferrer Maillol is not certain he should spell this out directly.</p>

            <p>"At our level, in our inner fellowship, it is not demanded of us that we pretend that the fates Pharasma assigned us are the fates we would have chosen for ourselves.&nbsp; We live inside an absolute and inescapable greater tyranny - all of us, from Cheliax to Lastwall, from slaves to the gods of Good.&nbsp; Most people have no natural response to that except for endless whining and complaining, and living in denial until Lawful Evil inevitably conquers everything that isn't Lawful Evil.&nbsp; <em>Some </em>of us are born with something that is native to the plane we live in, that can push along the tyranny rather than being swept away struggling.&nbsp; That's why we get to wear pretty rubies on our robes, and burn in Hell for a shorter time and come out of it as higher devils."</p>
            <p>"We're not just playing the game because we want a better score in it.&nbsp; It's <em>our</em> game.&nbsp; We'd play it even if Asmodeus wasn't there."</p>
            <p>"It's <em>that</em> quality - not feeling grateful for Asmodeus having to force us into it - that makes us the favored of Asmodeus and recognized as His own."</p>
            <p>Though that's all Inner Ring theology and part of his own favored concern of tyranny, which he should maybe not emphasize as much if Sevar hasn't a visible aptitude for it.</p>

Most people don't want to burn in the purifying flames of Hell - what does that mean? They would prefer it if they didn't in fact need much purifying? Sure, Carissa would prefer that too, that'd be awfully convenient, though she'd trade more purifying for coming out better on the other end - would most people not take that trade? Are most&nbsp;<em>clerics of Asmodeus&nbsp;</em>not able to notice that it is good to suffer if you come out of the suffering improved? But it's very obvious!! She thinks she could even phrase it so Keltham agreed? We are all slaves of this world the way Pharasma made it - seems true -&nbsp; presumably not heretical, to think of Pharasma as having made it - but also we would make it ourselves - but would we? Maybe we would make dath ilan, instead?&nbsp;</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"No, I do want help on that too. Keltham noticed that no one in Cheliax indicates how they feel during classes by looking distressed, and inferred from this that no one would indicate how they felt during sex by looking distressed, and that bothered him on some kind of principle that - so I think it did not in fact occur to him that one could simply not really care if people are secretly distressed, he instead concluded that we've got some extremely clever way to notice secret distress despite everyone hiding it, and was worried that not knowing this himself he'd fail to notice I was distressed, if I was, and I swear I didn't give him any reason to think I would be, he's just like this. And the problem with trying to lie to him is that which facts about the world are inferrable from which other ones is completely sideways for him, I'm genuinely worried that if I'd just said 'oh, normally people are really good at reading lip twitches, but I'll just tell you', then something else would've gone horribly wrong because he made a bunch of inferences from our presumed use of lip twitches - he was&nbsp;<em>really confused&nbsp;</em>about the fact people don't look distressed at each other on purpose, he felt like it was broken, a norm that shouldn't be able to persist in existing. And I have no idea what I'm allowed to tell him about anything and I'd rather as much as possible tell him the truth because of the sideways inferences problem but I haven't gotten any guidance on which things, specifically, I should lie about, besides Hell and I'm separately worried that if I just sleep with him, which I'd really really like to, and then later explain the thing where some people solve the inference problem by simply not caring how the other party is doing, then he'll be - he won't endorse having slept with me without knowing that.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That's the thing I was stuck on, what to tell him that - only relies on facts about human nature that are true in other countries too, and not on anything about Cheliax."</p>

            <p>She's going to try to explain it better this time in case maybe Maillol would understand it if she explained better.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"Keltham noticed that no one indicates how they feel during classes by looking distressed when they don't understand what's going on. That is not what happens in dath ilan. He inferred from this that no one would indicate how they felt during sex by looking distressed if they did not like what was being done to them. He - automatically assumed that we wouldn't want that, and concluded instead that we must have some more complicated way of communicating that information. I was uncertain whether to make one up or to try to explain to him that normally people just don't worry very much if their sex partners are invisibly distressed. The problem with trying to lie to him is that which facts about the world are inferrable from which other ones is completely sideways for him, and I don't think I could accurately track all the inferences he'd make from something I made up.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I'd rather as much as possible tell him the truth because of the sideways inferences problem but I need guidance on which things it's most important to keep secret even at some cost in our overall plausibility and coherence as he experiences it. And I need to solve this right away because I think if I just sleep with him and then later explain the thing where some people solve the inference problem by simply not caring how the other party is doing he won't endorse having slept with me without knowing that."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Elias Abarco has brought up additional points that Sevar didn't bring up, which complicates this already-painful decision.&nbsp; And Abarco didn't bring up the critical point about only telling Keltham the sad little facts that are true in other countries, not just in Cheliax, which means he wouldn't have done well leaving the whole decision to Abarco.</p>
            <p>Ferrer Maillol would, if he were alone, massage his forehead.</p>
            <p>The Asmodean style of tyranny is not about spreading around responsibility so nobody seems to be at fault for making bad decisions.&nbsp; Those are <em>weak</em> tyrannies.&nbsp; There must be a single decision-maker on point, as is both efficient and Asmodean.&nbsp; That designated person must be Abarco, Sevar, or Maillol himself, and any of those three people screwing up gets Maillol equally blamed for it, which leaves the pure and simple question of which of the three is <em>least </em>likely to fuck up.&nbsp; Maillol is pretty sure that's not himself, which brings it down to two.</p>
            <p>In the end, what decides him is simply that Abarco called Keltham 'insane'.&nbsp; It's not a judgment conducive to making the kind of detailed predictions necessary for the actual moment-to-moment decisions.</p>
            <p>"Asmodeus help you and me, Sevar, I'm making it your call.&nbsp; Your goal directives are as follows: prioritize the amount of time we get before this falls down and Keltham breaks with us.&nbsp; Secondary priority, if possible, try to make Keltham think that he should take you or some other loyal woman with him if he leaves us.&nbsp; Do not bother worrying about Keltham's opinion of Cheliax after the whole thing blows up.&nbsp; He won't be happy, ship sailed.&nbsp; Just make sure we get as much as we can from him before then."</p>
            <p>"Abarco.&nbsp; Advise Sevar well on this and all related matters, and report to me if you think she's fucking it up.&nbsp; If this project fails early and it looks like it was even slightly your fault for sabotaging her, I will make damned sure you die before I do."</p>
            <p>"Balaguerre.&nbsp; Sevar gets transcripts of Keltham's words, and his thoughts on remaining occasions where we make the call to risk reading his thoughts.&nbsp; Sevar gets consulted on Keltham analysis and policy if there's time.&nbsp; Sevar takes initiative on answering him if she's inside the room.&nbsp; Sevar gets reports on any other decisions that get made without her about what to tell him and why."</p>
            <p>"And give Sevar her <em>fucking </em>intelligence headband if we have a spare on hand.&nbsp; If we don't, give her a Fox's Cunning so she has <em>something </em>to work with for a few minutes while trying to make the call on Keltham.&nbsp; Then message at the next regular report that I want an intelligence headband delivered soonest, and if it's not here inside twenty-four hours then I will go looking for it and nobody wants to be there when I come looking."&nbsp; Maillol wishes he could just grab an intelligence headband from any of these fucking wizards who'll make less important use of it, but that is escalating <em>way </em>beyond just setting somebody on fire for a few hours, or at least wizards act that way.</p>

            <p>"A fact you may not know, Sevar - earlier thought-reading on Keltham showed him to be suspicious of externally supplied mind-affecting spells. &nbsp;It will be in your transcripts. &nbsp;Maybe we can play to that, find Keltham a book on the subject which mentions cursed forms of the item, or which claims that there's a higher-tier version of Fox's Cunning that you can use to make the recipient think they're smarter about particular subjects while actually not doing that. &nbsp;We've got a Wondrous Items enchanter working on a rush project to create tools so we can do edits to books more easily, and meanwhile we can get a forger-printer to stamp out individual alternate pages to splice in.&nbsp; Our <em>wonderful </em>new pet Nethys-worshipper does give us a way to send Keltham exactly the books we want him to have, and it explains why we're not just shipping him a dozen different ones."</p>
            <p>"If that ploy fails, or if you think it's a bad idea to try, and Keltham does start wanting to wear his own headband - getting you a higher-tier intelligence headband is not something I can do in a day, Sevar.&nbsp; But your request and the reason for it has been noted."</p>
            <p>"By tomorrow you'll also need to devise an explanation to Keltham for why you got your own private headband weeks ahead of the other women, if you want to wear it around him.&nbsp; If it's not a good enough explanation, you'll need to take it off around him.&nbsp; Do not give me any wizard shit about that."&nbsp; Maillol has very little sympathy for why wizards are under the impression that matters of intelligence headbands are an exception to the usual rules about shutting up and obeying orders, and Sevar is not high-circle enough for him to put up with it from her.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"You're not accustomed to being in the inner circle where you&nbsp;are expected to do your own thinking and put your life on the line for getting it right.&nbsp; Usually people get brought into it less abruptly than you, and it's possible I'm going to get called up on having trusted you more than you earned, contrary to Hell's instructions.&nbsp; My&nbsp;<em>belief</em> is that you earned it by understanding Keltham better than Abarco does, but you also haven't held that much responsibility before and my decision to dump it on you is going to look lethally questionable if you fuck it up.&nbsp; I cannot guarantee that I wasn't influenced by knowing, or thinking I knew, that you were a competent enough person to come to the momentary attention of a god.&nbsp; Asmodeus help us all if He was trying to tell us exactly not to do what I just did, by trusting you more than you'd earned.&nbsp; But we also got told to trust you no <em>less</em> than you'd earned, so."</p>
            <p>"That's all to frame an important point, Sevar, which is that the theological discussions that Asmodean priests hold among themselves are different from the way you learned theology out in the cold.&nbsp; We do not sound like fucking Keltham, because we are not fucking outsiders.&nbsp; But if a new priest has an affinity for slavery, and a fifth-circle priest specializes in tyranny, the fifth-circle priest doesn't tell her to shut up and write down the standard answers he gives her <em>about slavery."</em></p>
            <p>"From the standpoint of tyranny, feeling gratitude for Asmodeus owning us is how we tell the common people to feel about it, because it's a simple fucking answer that won't get them in trouble.&nbsp; Occasionally, though, Asmodeus goes and makes a bed-slave His cleric, which shows that His true priorities do not always match those that we harried and overworked mortals try to set. &nbsp;We almost always decide to wait on perfecting souls into the exact shape Asmodeus prefers until they get safely to Hell.&nbsp; Asmodeus cares in ways we don't even try to care, because it's not productive when we try to do it.&nbsp; If that bed-slave feeling some exact form of gratitude for being a slave was a vital part of what our Lord wishes mortals were like, you may need to wait for a priest who understands slavery more deeply than I do, to tell you that, because instructing me in those details wasn't the Church's own priority for a Worldwound administrator."</p>
            <p>"You have tyranny questions? &nbsp;I can answer those in endless detail, and you'd be stupid to argue until you understand Asmodeanism a lot better. &nbsp;But I will be checking some of the answers I gave you about slavery and pride, the next time I run into a superior of mine who has a moment. &nbsp;That's as much priority as I'd give to a fourth-circle priest asking me those questions, if the fourth-circle priest didn't tell me they were more urgent."</p>
            <p>"Final warning.&nbsp; Don't get lost in all these fascinating questions you're supposed to think about for the first time.&nbsp; Asmodeus instructed you to serve Him well in this world first."</p>
            <p>"Are we done, Sevar?&nbsp; I'll still be here if you have more questions another day, and you said Keltham was waiting on you."&nbsp; Maillol thinks and hopes this is exactly as much slack for interrupting him as he'd cut a fourth-circle cleric on urgent project business who was interrupting him for the first time.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"Was someone going to get me a Fox's Cunning -"</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And then someone does, by jabbing her in the shoulder. After this she's going to need to work on having a better working relationship with Abarco.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Fox's Cunning feels&nbsp;<em>good,&nbsp;</em>it feels&nbsp;<em>right,&nbsp;</em>and she's been told to correct for that, she's been told it's a flaw common to wizards, and she's not willing to trade her life for more of it so she's going to do what she was told and not reach for it more than she already has.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She closes her eyes and tries to drive out everything except the questions she has to answer tonight.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>First, serve Asmodeus in this world. Get close to Keltham, close enough that when he gets sick of Cheliax he takes you with him. Hold things together for long enough to learn new things about metalworking, new things about everything else that makes dath ilan prosperous, but keep in mind that the thinking is not the priority for the Chelish government or the Church. They might be making a mistake, and Carissa might be poised to correct them, but they probably aren't making a mistake, and they won't believe her&nbsp;<em>now.</em></p>
            <p>- she has the option of telling Keltham that. Not tonight, but it's a thought to tuck away for later, it's not damning, that the Chelish government trusts the metalworking to lead somewhere useful more than the habits of mind.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Keltham's sideways habits of inference are not, in fact, sideways, they're going to be a perfectly natural outgrowth of the things he's taught them in class, right now 'you don't know what he'll infer from a given bit of information' might be the best unenhanced Carissa can do but she needs that to stop being true as quickly as possible, replaced with the exact habits of inference herself, and it might not even be the best unenhanced Carissa can do; it's certainly not the best she can do now. In fact her mind is now rather spamming possibilities. Keltham thinks in - some theory of human psychology that extends from education to sex, it has gears even if she doesn't know them. &nbsp;He doesn't think sideways, he thinks in theories that make things be connected. &nbsp;He arrived in Golarion and noticed that it wasn't all women and went up to the theory about sex balances and where they came from and down again to know that mortals weren't made by gods. &nbsp;He noticed that people were wearing fixed cheerful expressions in class and went up to some theory about people and down again to how those kinds of people might be having sex. &nbsp;Carissa deeply wants to know this theory. &nbsp;Carissa manages to wrench her attention away from how much she wants to know this theory. &nbsp;Keltham wouldn't be stuck thinking about that if he didn't want to be, she's seen inside his mind.</p>
            <p>Keltham thinks in equilibriums; he notices when a strategy seems possible to deviate profitably from without being punished. Keltham is from a societal context where competence at deception is not itself a valuable thing to signal, because deception is basically frowned upon in every context. Last one feels most immediately fruitful, though it's easier than it was a moment ago to hold the other ones apart and not subtly downgrade them in her mind because she's started following the third. Keltham didn't parse them as 'signaling competence at deception' because you signal things you want people to know about and even if you want to be deceptive you wouldn't want people to know you want to be deceptive. Whereas in Cheliax - wait, check, is this only true in Cheliax, because if not she'd better not say it -</p>
            <p>- she should have a specific other country in mind when she tells Keltham how Cheliax works. Now that she thinks of it it seems very obvious. Keltham will be incredulous and disbelieving even about things she knows to be functional equilibriums, but that doesn't mean that every lie she can think of telling is equally credible as a functioning equilibrium. Societies are complicated and she can't invent 'Cheliax but LN', but she can tell Keltham how some place he wouldn't flee from works. Taldor is the obvious one. She doesn't know all that much about Taldor but she's met people from there, and it's culturally descended from Cheliax unlike Osirion or some place where she can't represent how the people there would explain themselves. The main thing everyone knows about Taldor is that it has a weak crown and too many dukes and counts who think too highly of themselves, and it's been wracked with civil war periodically for a long time, not falling only because the crown is old, and rich, and can hold Oppara where their power is invested no matter the madness that goes on beyond its walls. Quick check: has she claimed anything about Cheliax actively contradicted by that. She doesn't think so. Has anyone else -&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- she can&nbsp;<em>delegate&nbsp;</em>that, she has authority here -</p>
            <p>"I need someone to check whether anyone has said anything to Keltham that would be inconsistent with Cheliax being approximately Taldor in political organization and culture until the Church backed the right side in the most recent civil war and Hell sent some people to try to shape the crown up."<br><br>And now she's followed that train of thought far enough and needs to pull back and contemplate an entirely different one - she can see, from here, how she's been neglecting that before, going with her intuition until it is actually surprised or contradicted somewhere -</p>
            <p>- Keltham has a general theory of human nature that is surprised by Golarion, not just by Cheliax, so he's missing something, and it'd be useful to figure out what, both because she might want to tell him and because it'll help with verisimilitude. He's missing - and her mind is spamming possibilities again, not that she's confident in any of them - that people signal negative qualities. That people prefer for other people to lose; that people have values actively incompatible with other people getting what they want, that people are bad enough at thinking that trying to make them think about something is dangerous - many of these are too specifically Chelish -<br><br>This would be much simpler if she could make Keltham tell her all the theories he uses to understand people. &nbsp;Maybe she can sell her superior - or just the one superior, now - on the theory that if they ask Keltham to explain those parts, Keltham will be easier to fool.<br><br>- set that aside too, flagged as maybe possibly coming from the part of her that is tempted to trade off lifespan against intelligence headbands.<br><br>Keltham has learned more from them than they've learned from him. &nbsp;He is surprised by Golarion, he is missing something, he underadjusts or overadjusts or adjusts along completely wrong dimensions but he's notably much less wrong than he was a day ago, already. They will not be able to hide things in the vast fog of his confusion for very long, because he is narrowing it.&nbsp;<br><br>They should tell him less, if they possibly can. &nbsp;They should say it's not the priority that gets their project more support and headbands delivered earlier. &nbsp;They should say they don't know. &nbsp;They should find legitimately very important questions they can ask Keltham instead of spending lots of time explaining things to him. &nbsp;She should find something simple to say to him about sex, that's true everywhere in Golarion, and only later, if ever, ask him to explain theories.</p>
            <p><br>It's not a pleasant thought, not the answer that she wanted inside at all, and Carissa might not have managed to think it before she saw inside Keltham's head.<br><br>Fox's Cunning wears off and leaves her - tired. And in a bad mood. And now she - still doesn't feel any closer to figuring out what to say to Keltham - but she remembers the direction she'd found when she was smarter, and she knows perfectly well how being smarter works, that it's a glimpse of a person you want to grow up to be, even if you have to be dragged kicking and screaming, because it's not always pleasant for the tiny stupid things that humans are to grow into bigger smarter things...<br><br>"Is he still on the roof."<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes," Elias says irritably.<br><br>She hurries.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>It got a little cold and lonely up on the roof without Carissa to lean against.</p>
            <p>Keltham solved this problem by going down, wandering around randomly for a bit, not seeing any security anywhere he looked, calling out for "Security?" in a not especially loud voice, seeing somebody step around a corner a third of a minute later, and, you know, you would think that if this whole place had elaborate tunnels in the walls for security to hide, and that was being kept secret and not told to him, they would be <em>hiding this fact </em>by having some&nbsp;<em>visible</em> security officers but&nbsp;<em>fine.</em>&nbsp; Anyways, Keltham then asked if there was such a thing as magic to keep him warm, since the roof had no obvious switchable infrared-lamp-heaters, and the problem got solved.</p>
            <p>After that, the roof was about as good a place to think as his bedroom, with an increased probability of later Carissa materialization.</p>
            <p>Keltham is currently wondering if maybe Golarion just sort of... collectively lacks the form of Law-aspiring thought where, if you have a problem, you try to think of a way you could rearrange reality such that you wouldn't have the problem anymore.</p>
            <p>It would explain everything he's seen, in one sense.&nbsp; But explains too many things he hasn't seen, in another.&nbsp; Somebody invented stairs as a solution to the problem of climbing to the roof, thereby falsifying the general form of the theory.&nbsp; Maybe that was before they invented wizard-based contraception and bred intelligence out of themselves, though?&nbsp; Or maybe devils told them how to make stairs.</p>
            <p>(He's aware it's not a very plausible theory.&nbsp; But sometimes when you don't <em>get</em> something, it can be productive to play with impossible theories, or even frustrated yelling at reality, in case that knocks something loose; so long as you don't just keep on doing that.)</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"- huh. That's - Straightforward Romance around here, Complicated Romance involves hiring specialized seduction devils to test peoples' monogamy commitments who've made them or something. Anyway I don't have much riding on being your type because every girl you're going to find here's got light brown skin and dark brown eyes and hair. ...saying Lrilatha would be a Complicated Romance response because the possibility is real that she'd hear about it, I think maybe my mental delineation is whether we have introduced non-romance stakes..." She's kind of bad at...not telling Keltham things....this is a bad thing to be bad at!!!</p>
