            <p>Though Ione might be less likely than some, but no; for purposes of deciding whether it's okay to <em>risk having kids</em>, he needs to assume that Ione is scripted - by Governance, not by some metalevel eroLARP - and can't be trusted either.</p>
            <p>"I know what Science Maniac Verrez would do in this situation - namely, figure out how to use Prestidigitation to impose a magnet-field over his own sperm, the way that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance">mature male contraception technology</a> works in dath ilan.&nbsp; But in real life, if you try that sort of thing... well, no, actually, I guess I could heal myself, if I hurt myself.&nbsp; Unless I gave myself cancer.&nbsp; But that, I'd guess, just takes a more powerful cleric spell.&nbsp; And even if I literally kill myself, you could bring me back... but the problem is verifying that the sperm are actually <em>dead</em> and that the silly clever trick <em>worked,</em> when I can't ask anybody here to help me figure out how to verify whether sperm are alive... but there was a spell Detect Life on Ione's list, I'm pretty sure, and if I ask my god to give me that, I can see if it works on sperm and then it goes through my god rather than anyone here..."</p>
            <p>"Or actually - potentially simpler solutions.&nbsp; Is there a fourth-circle or lower spell I can ask my god to give me, that would let me create a small object that isn't as fragile as Prestidigitating that, and can have properties like, impermeability to fluid, adhesion to skin until dispelled."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Oof, that's a Cost there, if it has to be 12 weeks along, meaning they couldn't just find somebody who didn't actually want a baby and pay them to participate in the experiment.&nbsp; Though maybe Cheliax has some wizards who only do the Alter Self thing after they detect, or change their minds, and advertising for one of those would turn somebody up... it doesn't really solve the main problem, though, because he can't be sure that what works at 12 weeks works at 1 hour.</p>
            <p>"If you Alter Self immediately after sex, then shift back, would I be able to check inside you and verify that the semen had vanished?&nbsp; Maybe I'd be willing to try for the further trust in that case, that semen doesn't persist in a vagina or uterus that you don't have... actually no, shit, I can't rely on that, because you could also produce that result with Prestidigitation even if it wouldn't ordinarily happen from Alter Self.&nbsp; No wait, counter-2-arguendo, if you can cast Alter Self and come back fast enough, I can have Detect Magic running the whole time, check your vaginal contents before and after, and verify that Alter Self was the only magic to affect you over that period..."</p>
            <p>This is actually kind of fascinating, as Compounding Capabilities problems go.&nbsp; Maybe the eroLARP is deconstructing a computer game where the player needed to drag the spells from a list of available spells to form the correct structure to eliminate a pregnancy, before they could fuck anybody.&nbsp; That sounds like how a computer-game version of an eroLARP would work.</p>

            <p>One also needs to consider that, at a sufficient level of magical power and ill intent, they could have done something clever when he had sex with Carissa the previous day, quickly moving semen from her mouth to her vagina, maybe as screened by an illusion.&nbsp; Heck, they could've teleported sperm right out of his epididymis while he was sleeping in the villa the first night, before the Forbiddance went up - though they'd also have to mix it with seminal fluid to have a chance for the sperm to survive a uterus.</p>

Different flavor. ...also I think some people experience failures of will, about obeying an order like that for weeks or months, especially if you're messing with them around it enough, so maybe they actually do have to worry about breaking a rule even though they didn't mean to. I have never tried anything like this before so I shouldn't think too highly of myself but I&nbsp;<em>think&nbsp;</em>there's no order up to and including 'stick your hand in that fire and keep it there' I'd just disobey without warning you first that it was proving too difficult; if I would, then I'm just pretending, and I don't want to be just pretending."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>He has again that sense of being unnervingly close to some ledge, on which Carissa may be trying to stabilize him, or maybe push him off.&nbsp; His mind retreats from the dangerous thing, tries to talk about something lesser and more trivial and safer: oh, is this anything like the thing some women do in Civilization, if they want to have a lot of sex available to trade for social capital, or collect a large harem, where they limit themselves to one actual orgasm per month, and otherwise stop short of that, to increase their sex drives?</p>
            <p>He forces himself to face the scary thing instead; it doesn't pay to do that all day long, but he's had relatively few shocking revelations today.</p>
            <p>"I don't know whether I'm more frightened-intrigued by the notion of you wanting to make it <em>impossible </em>to disobey orders, or the amount by which you're trying to hand me the total keys to your sexuality, but both of those things feel like they're a step too far for me to do this minute, and I need to let it sink in for an hour without forcing it -"</p>
            <p>"My mind is imagining you struggling inside the chains and not being able to get out, though, and it thinks that's very sexy, much more sexy than just being chained up at all -"</p>
            <p>"I'm sorry.&nbsp; I need to hear you tell me that's okay, if and only if that actually is okay, obviously, I'm not asking you to send a false signal, but even after hearing you say it's fine to kill you, my brain still wants to hear you say whether or not it's okay that I'd see you struggling to get out of the chains and not let you out."</p>
            <p>It really feels like this is a situation that <em>demands</em> the ability to talk in metalanguage and say 'dequote'; but Carissa keeps on seeming to reject, not so much that specific proposal, as the entire framework of thought that would want to hear about it.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I hate Chaotic Good," Aspexia Rugatonn says, her voice sounding reflective and her face as impassive as always.&nbsp; She looks up from the papers in her hand, having just finished reviewing a transcript of Pilar's report on her involuntary tour of Elysium.&nbsp; "I hate, hate, hate Chaotic Good.&nbsp; If hatred were diamonds I could take my hatred of Chaotic Good and cast Miracle with it and have enough left over for a thousand Resurrections.&nbsp; I would, personally, rather go to Abaddon than Elysium."</p>
            <p><br>Pilar Pineda swallows.&nbsp; "Grand High Priestess - is this one permitted to ask -"</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Just speak your thoughts, Pineda.&nbsp; I can hear them anyways."</p>
            <p><br>"I was confused by the Chaotic Good outsider's claim that it served Asmodeus's interests for Cayden Cailean to do what He did to me.&nbsp; I wonder if - if you think they're telling the truth, that I am not meant to be - harmful to our Lord -"</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You don't conclude that I believe they were telling the truth, from the fact that you're still alive?"</p>
            <p><br>No because the Grand High Priestess could be unsure and wanting to keep her options open, or because she could have some cunning counterplot of her own to whatever it is that Cayden Cailean is trying to do -</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are correct that I'm unsure," the Grand High Priestess answers her unspoken thought.&nbsp; "But while Chaotic Good is not Lawful Good, under those circumstances and speaking to someone like you, it is unfortunately plausible that they would tell the truth."</p>
            <p><br><em>Unfortunately?</em> Pilar thinks, putting on hold her own relief if she really isn't being used against Asmodeus.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, because&nbsp;<em>now we are confused,</em> as they no doubt intended, and our lives have become&nbsp;<em>more complicated</em>.&nbsp; I rather doubt that, whatever larger plot is in play, that larger plot is meant to conduce to Asmodeus's interests.&nbsp; If their plot is to destroy all Cheliax and then <em>you </em>are meant to prevent a new Worldwound from opening amid the ruins, that is not, on the whole, good news.&nbsp; Though yes, even in that case, we would prefer there not be another Worldwound, so if some such apparent duty falls to you, perform it unless directed otherwise.&nbsp; It is the job of such as myself to counterplot against Cayden Cailean's larger plan, not you."</p>
            <p><br>Pilar nods her head.&nbsp; She understands, or thinks she does.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This leaves us with the question of your behavior and performance during your trip to Elysium."&nbsp; The Grand High Priestess regards Pilar more sternly, now.<br><br></p>
            <p>Pilar isn't nearly as frightened as she should be, she knows, even though that's a bad thought.&nbsp; She turned down Elysium for Asmodeus, and even if it's a wrong thought to think, still, that probably counts for something.<br><br></p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, I see," says the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus, her face impassive.&nbsp; "You believe that you performed adequately?"</p>
            <p><br>Is she still supposed to answer in words at all?&nbsp; Probably, unless she's told not to, she's been asked a direct question.&nbsp; "No mortal performs to Asmodeus's standards," Pilar answers.&nbsp; "And all imperfections are worthy of punishment, if the slave is even worth that much time."&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilar can't quite stop herself from thinking that, imperfect and flawed slave of Asmodeus as she may be, she's probably due for quite a lot less punishment than others would be in her position.&nbsp; This thought is itself, of course, worthy of punishment.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The face of the Grand High Priestess remains impassive.&nbsp; "Do you know how specifically, you fell short?"</p>
            <p><br>Pilar knows some parts that are obvious even to her.&nbsp; "I was unable to justify myself clearly, when the Elysians asked me why I didn't want to stay - if I had been more trained in theology, I would have been able to -"</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Chaotic Good outsiders cannot be persuaded into our Lord's embrace, and to justify yourself to them or argue with them, even taking our Lord's position, does not serve His interests in any way.&nbsp; That you answered the Elysians at all is your failure, not that you answered incorrectly."</p>
            <p><br>Pilar feels stupid.&nbsp; "I understand."</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What else?"</p>
            <p><br>"The Elysians told me that if I stayed in Elysium, I would never again have to cast torture spells on children with no other uses in order to prove my loyalty, which they somehow knew I hadn't liked doing in the academy.&nbsp; I could feel myself swaying to that, and when I felt that, I knew that after I came back, I would have to be retrained to do it better and without any hesitation.&nbsp; For only a moment, then, I was tempted to stay."</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Pity," says the Grand High Priestess.&nbsp; "That significantly decreases your future usefulness.&nbsp; I will make a note in your file that you are not to be tasked with such work unless there is strong reason."</p>
            <p><br>Pilar doesn't know how to respond to that in words, at first, for being so surprised.&nbsp; She would expect to be punished for her reluctance and corrected; for her to be exempted from unpleasant work instead is something that could be mistaken for mercy, and it is impossible that Aspexia Rugatonn would reason so.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There will be plenty of time to train out every last one of your flaws after you are received in Hell," the Grand High Priestess answers the unspoken thought.&nbsp; "Meanwhile, in this world, your proven loyalty is potentially useful.&nbsp; If that is a weak and vulnerable point in you, I will not have it strained without good cause and bring into question whether your loyalty remains as it was.&nbsp; The more so, if the Elysians could potentially have planned to lure us into doing exactly that, after first giving us apparent reason to trust you."</p>
            <p><br>Again Pilar feels stupid, but this is only natural when somebody who is not Aspexia Rugatonn is talking to somebody who is Aspexia Rugatonn.&nbsp; The Elysians made her scared of something that, it turned out, was not in Asmodeus's interests to do to her.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What else?" says the Grand High Priestess.</p>
            <p><br>Pilar swallows.&nbsp; This part is worthy of severe punishment.&nbsp; "I had the thought several times that - when they showed me Hell, and what that's like for people who aren't me - that, even if I didn't want to be in Elysium - maybe it would be better - if the people who wanted to be in Hell could be in Hell and the people who wanted to be in Elysium could be in Elysium."</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are correct, that is a thought worthy of severe punishment."</p>
            <p><br>Pilar bows her head.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You may find it useful to contemplate, however, that the present nature of things is temporary.&nbsp; In due time, everyone will go to Hell, and everyone will want to go to Hell."</p>
            <p><br>That does make Pilar feel better, though she's surprised that she's getting any consolation at all when the thought is incorrect in the first place.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Because if you are so flawed as to have that thought, there is no point in allowing that thought even greater power over you by failing to consider what weighs against it on its own terms," answers the Grand High Priestess.&nbsp; "Now, Pineda, answer me this.&nbsp; Why am I the one consoling on you on this, instead of you taking these issues to someone in the priesthood or simply Security, whose time is far less valuable than mine?"</p>
            <p><br>That's a good question and Pilar is unable to stop herself from thinking that maybe it's because, having proven her loyalty, she's now that valuable - no, that wouldn't make sense, it's Chaotic Good outsider exposure which only the Grand High Priestess is most competent to correct if it introduced any problems -</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Wrong.&nbsp; According to Security's initial interview with you, you thought of asking them for correction, but you had the thought that, if the Elysians were telling you the truth, maybe the Security officer was also somebody who'd take the chance to stay in Elysium if they believed they had that chance.&nbsp; You were afraid that, if that was true, being corrected by Security would mean replacing your more correct thoughts with their less correct thoughts."<br><br></p>
            <p>Pilar did also think (not that this defends her or lessens anything) that she didn't distrust them in general, it wasn't that she distrusted Security about Security, it was just, on the particular issue of being tempted to stay in Elysium, thinking incorrect thoughts when you're in Elysium, she couldn't trust them <em>about that</em> -</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "So the leader of Asmodeus's Church in Golarion had to personally take her valuable time to correct you, because, now, you would not have trusted almost anyone else.&nbsp; Now that Chaotic Good outsiders have whispered to you that you are more truly loyal to Asmodeus and more correct in your thinking and more trustworthy than the senior wizards in security."</p>
            <p><br>"Yes," Pilar whispers, feeling miserable.&nbsp; The Elysians got to her after all.<br><br></p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Unfortunately, the Elysians told you the truth.&nbsp; This being the case, your concern was simply correct.&nbsp; Nearly all wizards in Security and indeed even most priests of Asmodeus have <em>not</em> proven themselves able to meet the test of true loyalty that you passed.&nbsp; They are not authorized to correct your thoughts about Elysium or who is most loyal to Asmodeus.&nbsp; Only myself or those I designate are authorized to so correct you."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That said, to state your self-humbling thought more precisely, great loyalty is often not the quality most critical to a commander.&nbsp; One usually wishes for great competence foremost, accompanied by whatever level of loyalty seems adequate and with some safety margin.&nbsp; If on some rare occasion the quality we needed in a commander was the greatest possible loyalty, and this was more important than your lack of experience and knowledge and power and your many other failings, perhaps then you would be placed in command.&nbsp; Nor should you mistake the <em>possibility</em> that your superiors are less loyal than you, for your own certain knowledge of that fact.&nbsp; Understand?"</p>
            <p><br>"Yes," Pilar answers.<br><br></p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Good.&nbsp; After this, you will report to the temple torture chamber and assign yourself whatever degree of punishment you feel is appropriate for your failures in Elysium."</p>
            <p><br>To say that Pilar is surprised would be an understatement indeed.&nbsp; She will obey, of course, but - she doesn't understand, is this a test, to see if she'll assign herself too little punishment, or if she'll assign herself extra to prove her loyalty -</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are done with tests of that kind," the Grand High Priestess answers.&nbsp; "You have passed the strongest version of that test which anyone could face.&nbsp; You know your own history in more detail than I do, my time is valuable, and I cannot be bothered to interview you on specifics and evaluate them.&nbsp; You do it.&nbsp; Just assign yourself whatever tortures seem standard and appropriate for your failures.&nbsp; If you desire any more punishment than that for reasons of faith, do it on your own recognizance."</p>
            <p><br><em>Because you are trusted, now.</em></p>
            <p>No, Pilar must only be imagining that this could be the subtext, here, she is not - not that worthy, she is only a second-circle wizard -</p>
            <p>Pilar rises and turns to go.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Pilar," Aspexia Rugatonn says, before Pilar has reached the door.&nbsp; Her voice is, if not gentle, unusually not-harsh.&nbsp; "Pride is one of our Lord's domains.&nbsp; As you should not be mistaken about who is above you, you should also not be mistaken about who is lower.&nbsp; Speak to me the thought you are not letting yourself think."</p>
            <p><br>Pilar turns back.</p>
            <p>She takes a deep breath.</p>
            <p>"Grand High Priestess," Pilar says, "if you had to lead an army of adventurers into Elysium, and anyone who followed you would have a choice to stay in Elysium, how many - how many could you find to take with you?"</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Eleven."</p>
            <p><br><em>Eleven!?&nbsp;</em>Pilar thinks in dismay and even horror, though she does not, of course, question the Grand High Priestess out loud.&nbsp; Eleven, <em>in all of Cheliax?</em></p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, I am sure there are many more than eleven in Cheliax who would make the choice you did to leave Elysium behind.&nbsp; Our service to our Lord would be pathetic indeed, if all the Church's work in Cheliax these last eighty years had produced no more than eleven souls truly loyal to Him.&nbsp; The trouble is, you see, Pilar, that Asmodeans do lie to themselves, about what choice they would make there, and though this lie is also pleasing to our Lord, it is still, in the end, a lie.&nbsp; They would not know their disloyalty even to themselves, and Detect Thoughts would not suffice to root them out.&nbsp; The Chaotic Good outsider who spoke to you was also truthful about that aspect of things."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We punish people whose disloyalty rises to the level of thoughts that we can see, that they can know to themselves; and while that does to some extent serve to train away disloyal thinking, sometimes it only trains away the visibility.&nbsp; In Cheliax, where they know their thoughts will be read again in time, that serves well enough; when there is a certainty of Hell in time, it serves well enough.&nbsp; Faced with Elysium, those thoughts might suddenly resurface."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There are many more in Cheliax who would refuse Elysium, of that I am sure.&nbsp; There are eleven of whom I <em>know.</em>&nbsp; Eleven of whom&nbsp;I am <em>certain.</em>"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well.&nbsp; Twelve, now."</p>
            <p><br>Pilar Pineda feels prouder in that moment than she has in her entire life.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There is no reward for a job well done in Cheliax," says Aspexia Rugatonn.&nbsp; "Only a diminishing of punishments for failure.&nbsp; This does not mean that a job done well never benefits you, Pilar.&nbsp; Only that, if so, the benefit is incidental to how it serves our Lord's interests.&nbsp; You have proven yourself as few of our Lord's followers ever prove themselves, and if you were not already assigned to one of the most important projects in Cheliax, you soon would be."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go with Asmodeus, Pilar Pineda.&nbsp; You have done as well as mortals ever do."</p>
            <p><br>"Thank you!&nbsp; You've been so super helpful to me, actually, do you want a cookie?"</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>Pilar turns and hurls the sourceless cookie at the wall as hard as she can.&nbsp; Under other circumstances she would scream.&nbsp; This was literally the finest moment she will ever have in her life, and Cayden fucking Cailean just ruined it for her.</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Only if you let Him ruin it," Aspexia Rugatonn says, though the harshness is back in her voice.&nbsp; "I genuinely hope we can find something to do about your problem."</p>
            <p><br>Pilar departs.&nbsp; She is reminded of the fact that Aspexia Rugatonn's time is indeed valuable, and how much of it just got spent on her, when she sees the line of important people who were waiting outside for her to finish.</p>
            <p>The next person in that line, robed as a third-circle priest, darts inside and slams two pieces of paper on Rugatonn's desk and begins some rapid hushed report without waiting for the door to shut.&nbsp; The door hasn't closed and sealed away the sounds within, in fact, when Pilar on her way out hears the Grand High Priestess's voice rising to almost a shriek, "<em>He what?</em>"</p>
            <p>Somebody is about to have a very bad day, and Pilar is glad it's not her.</p>
            <p>She skips her way along towards the temple's torture chamber, for almost ten full steps, before she realizes that she is <em>fucking skipping through the halls</em> and manages to fucking stop it.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>At first it's not obvious to the remaining student body of the Secret Project what exactly they're supposed to do with themselves; Carissa's orders, when she briefly walked past them while retrieving her possessions to leave with Keltham for the imperial palace, were 'learn about Taldor'. But it doesn't take them all that long to find their feet; obviously no one's going to come walk them through everything like they're children.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Security has swept the villa for things left behind by Kuthites, found a couple of old chambers that were perfectly sealed up with old skeletons inside, which isn't very interesting, and reorganized all the bedrooms so as to make the place defensible if the project returns here, though it might not. There are devils openly patrolling the grounds, now, each of them bound within their ten-foot circles (it's the cheapest way to get devils). They can't fight much like that, obviously, but they'll notice it. And unlike human security they don't complain about the by-now-fairly-torrential rain.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And the whole mess is a good excuse to completely reformulate the library to be in line with the project. Paxti requests permission to go with Security to Absalom book-shopping, and when that doesn't work Yaisa tries seducing Elias for the same privilege (he sleeps with her but does not take her to Absalom, which is a valuable life lesson). But there's sorting through all the existing books for consistency with the new paradigm, and making fun of the old Taldane romance novels, and while Security's using all their Teleports for war-related travel they do go out to Ostenso's bookshops and find some books published in Taldor or in pre-Hell Cheliax they can work with.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>By the afternoon of the day after the attack this effort is in full swing; they have books in piles on the floor, and are reading through them and chattering about them and sorting them and Mending them as needed. They have a plan for if Keltham shows up unexpectedly, they're going to claim there was water damage to the books, since a bunch of windows broke in the fight and it's been raining so hard since then. (So that this isn't a lie, they're causing some water damage to the books.)</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>If the word 'rape' is translating at all correctly, Keltham is having some trouble seeing how the notion of a 'rape fetish' isn't as obviously paradoxical as 'asking somebody to rape you'; but presumably there's some elided meta/object distinction that makes sense of it, and in any case that's not the most urgent topic right now.</p>
            <p>So.&nbsp; Pilar has the fetish.&nbsp; But it's very common locally, maybe it's 1/3 of the population, say, if he'd also checked Ione then taking the universe at face value there'd be a 55% probability of at least one of the two having the fetish.&nbsp; But still, it should probably be called something like one bit of evidence favoring the eroLARP hypothesis.</p>
            <p>"I wasn't saying Sevar was too stupid for it," Keltham replies after taking a moment to think.&nbsp; "I was saying the concept structure came at the end of a long series of other concepts, that would take too long to explain.&nbsp; Higher Intelligence doesn't let you bypass that sequence, what would be needed is that you have a lot of prerequisites that I'd guess to be outright unknown in Golarion."</p>
            <p>There's also the concern about whether explaining the notion of an eroLARP to people inside the eroLARP will drive them insane or cause this universe to collapse.&nbsp; But if Carissa is able to hear him talking about his weird theories and the very smart people immediately investigate them in Pilar and report back to him, it doesn't seem like that kind of eroLARP; they're apparently allowed to know.&nbsp; Anyways, though it seems kind of foolish in retrospect, he already published that private key.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>From reading his friends' fanfictions about a currently-superpopular novel deconstructing eroLARPs; eroLARPs that, by comparison, almost nobody must have actually played, compared to how many people found out about them by reading some of their friends' fanfictions so they wouldn't be left out of discussions about it.&nbsp; But that's not really what she's asking, anyways.</p>
            <p>Now, how to reply without panicking her over the idea that her universe might be fictional?&nbsp; Which isn't even actually the idea here; but if you don't know about computer simulations, and the generalized notion of laws of physics that let you imagine alternate such laws, and equivalence classes of causal structures embedded in other structures, and realityfluids generalizing quantum amplitudes, what do you even <em>say </em>that the smart-but-ignorant Golarion native <em>doesn't</em> just parse down to 'possibly we're all just a generalized illusion or maybe trapped in some sort of book, sure go panic now'.</p>
            <p>"I'm not really sure how to say it, except that the patterns are in my memories out of dath ilan, and their origin in dath ilan was complicated," Keltham replies.&nbsp; "I would not have particularly <em>expected</em> to find facts and events here, corresponding to those memories.&nbsp; And a lot of things don't correspond in that way, to be clear, I'd have been much less confused, getting here, if this world was even 5% made out of things I was expecting to see.&nbsp; But there's bits and pieces of this world, all over, that fit into one pattern or another.&nbsp; And the danger is that I'm just looking up at random clouds, and seeing faces, trees, patterns in the sky that are pure coincidence.&nbsp; As you say, if the fetish is very common here, then Pilar having it isn't much evidence."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>All right, that's slightly impressive, maybe the bigger headbands are actually good for anything.</p>
            <p>"It would have to be, yeah, but I don't exactly have a lot of specifics and what specifics I have... aren't something I'm thinking of a good metaphor for... let me think."&nbsp; Sure, if you've got <em>enough</em> prerequisites, it's obvious in retrospect that the explanation for what happened to Keltham is that <em>almost </em>all of the copies of him ended, across the multiverse of everything being infinitely embedded all over the multiverse, and this is one of the Kelthams that didn't end, in some universe that's either higher-complexity than his original universe or of course a higher-complexity specific embedded somewhere simpler than that, and then, arguendo, if the EroLARP Hypothesis is correct, he was localized to somewhere such that it has convenient evolutionarily-implausible 'masochists' who are <em>super </em>okay with not being let out of their chains when they struggle, so that hurting them during sex, which it turned out you really wanted to do, doesn't get you kicked out of that city or exiled to the Last Resort.</p>
            <p>Keltham <em>has not figured out why this would be the case,&nbsp;</em>but he doesn't need a specific hypothesis of&nbsp;<em>why</em> to notice what it&nbsp;<em>looks like</em> and start generating predictions.</p>
            <p>And then, of course, you have the problem of explaining this to a Golarion native who has no idea that her own world sure looks like it runs on quantum mechanics the same as dath ilan, and how that means there's an exponentially vast number of near-exact copies of her spread all over the <em>local</em> amplitudes to say nothing of the alternate laws of physics that embed each other as substructures.</p>
            <p>Does Taldane contain the word 'fanfiction'?&nbsp; No it does not.&nbsp; Well, there goes that metaphor for 'this world is a continuation fic of my life because in an infinite multiverse containing an infinite number of fanfiction writers no book can ever truly end', which, on reflection, would probably have been an overly disturbing thing to try to explain <em>anyways.</em></p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>What a beautiful opening.&nbsp; "You're with her under true premises.&nbsp; She's exactly correct.&nbsp; I'm not necessarily saying that to encourage you to mistreat her.&nbsp; But you need to understand, Keltham, there are no sane countries on the face of Golarion that would <em>not </em>do the equivalent of handing over Carissa Sevar to you, or worse, if that was the price of banishing plagues from our cities and growing enough wheat for one farmer to feed two others and closing the Worldwound and offering refuge to women in Osirion who want to leave their husbands and someday, yes, matching the accomplishments and wisdom of dath ilan.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, the price of what those other countries would ask from you, instead of that.&nbsp; Giving one woman to you who would <em>not</em> enjoy being so given, would not be something that pleases the modern Chelish government or the Church of Asmodeus that we work with, but we would weigh the price if we did not, and conclude that it was far more than worth it."</p>
            <p>"So Carissa Sevar is, in fact, under your de facto power, exactly where she wants to be and needs to be.&nbsp; The possible problems I foresee, stem from you failing to understand that this is what she needs, this is what she wants, this is how her sexuality works, and that your de facto power to do anything you want with Sevar is <em>part</em> though of course not&nbsp;<em>all</em> of why she started being attracted to you in the first place.&nbsp; It is in the interest of Cheliax for obvious reasons that you continue to be happy with Carissa, fond of her home country of Cheliax, energized and productive for your project, and not <em>distracted </em>by being <em>heartbroken </em>after what happened when you were always careful to emphasize to Carissa how much she was free to go at any time if she didn't want to stay."</p>

            <p>...and now the tree isn't branching further.&nbsp; Keltham is having more trouble than usual thinking about this.&nbsp; Part of himself is recoiling in horror and it's not because the situation being described sounds awful for Carissa, it's because something about it seems terrible and threatening for&nbsp;<em>him.</em></p>
            <p>Is it that he distrusts himself with power?</p>
            <p>Is it that he's afraid of pressuring himself into doing something to Carissa that he didn't really want to do, even&nbsp;<em>if</em> she turns out to want it?</p>

            <p>"There are, I suppose, other possible interpretations of why a submissive would give herself entirely to a man, whom she somehow happens to be very attracted to, who coincidentally happens to have de facto absolute-power over her.&nbsp; But given that Sevar has in any case told you to do anything you want with her, I don't see why you would be worried that I am, say, trying to lure you into doing <em>too much to her, more than she wants,</em> which is itself a rather odd thing for me to try to accomplish."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"I think, first and foremost, that you should not press yourself too hard or make yourself unhappy by going too far too early, even if that's what Sevar wants," Isidre says, making a sudden change of plans.&nbsp; "This is an Evil country, not a Good one, and among the foundational reasons for that is that Good people all trying to help each other instead of themselves seem to inevitably end up sad and unhappy at the end of it.&nbsp; You have a Civilization to build here, Keltham, your role in life is not actually to make Sevar happy.&nbsp; She is responsible for her own life's happiness, as you are for yours."</p>
            <p>"<em>With that said,</em> if you yourself,&nbsp;<em>for your own sake and not hers,</em> decided one day to demand that the government of Cheliax give you absolute-power over her and order our Security to put her forcibly into her chains any time she didn't want to go, Carissa Sevar herself would be very, very happy about that.&nbsp; But I will quite understand if you do not wish to essay that until you are confident of your ability to discern that happiness for yourself."</p>
            <p>"And.&nbsp; There are other women in Cheliax if Sevar's happiest outcome is <em>not what you want.</em>&nbsp; You are not obliged to give literally the first girl in this world that you talked to everything that she wants from life, at your own expense.&nbsp; That is what it means to be Evil rather than Good."</p>
            <p>"A further warning.&nbsp; Sevar is not the most extreme case of what she is.&nbsp; Pilar Pineda is more submissive than Sevar, substantially more masochistic than Sevar, and would, in a way very strange to you, feel raped if you made her have a careful conversation about sex instead of just forcibly throwing her onto a bed.&nbsp; My considered opinion is that if you are struggling and flailing with Sevar you are <em>absolutely certainly</em> not ready for Pineda."</p>

            <p>...actually, why&nbsp;<em>did</em> he use Detect Poison, this time, when he didn't think to try it in the dining hall before?</p>
            <p>Are his instincts trying to tell him something?&nbsp; Keltham now wishes he hadn't eaten that snack; but he's at least not going to eat any more.<br><br></p>
            <p>His brain, still running in the background and creative as ever, suggests that, if this is an eroLARP-ish context and therefore Keltham has a dreadful buried urge to rape somebody which Pilar matches, he could in fact run three Augury spells before trying that, to check what the consequences would be.&nbsp; Obviously after having first done a bunch more work to verify that the Augury uses his own utility function or a sufficiently aligned neighboring one.</p>
            <p>Keltham tells that thread to shut up.&nbsp; He's starting to doubt this whole eroLARP business if it implies that he would enjoy <em>that</em>.&nbsp; Anyways the concept of a 'rape fetish' in the sense of 'wanting unwanted sex' is literally paradoxical and the term presumably means something else.</p>

            <p>"In practice, the actual and much simpler reply is that the revelation from Asmodeus which led to this project's establishment said, or at least, we think this is what Asmodeus was trying to say, to not pull any of that on you.&nbsp; So no such discussion was ever entertained at any level of government.&nbsp; If you're looking for a simple answer that doesn't require you to worry about backroom discussions by people like me, it's right there, I suppose.&nbsp; Possibly that's why Asmodeus ordained it so, if you feel that way.&nbsp; I don't think we <em>would </em>have decided to unsheathe blades at you, absent His order, but I can see His order simplifying things from your perspective."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>That couldn't&nbsp;<em>actually</em> be the reason for Asmodeus's instructions, could it?&nbsp; No, it has to be some pre-existing godagreement, or a bargain with Abadar and Nethys whose initial premise was that they cooperated to bring Keltham here and Cheliax got first crack at him, or one of the other likely possibilities that Aspexia reluctantly discussed (reluctantly because Aspexia would rather that Abrogail shut up and follow His orders).&nbsp; Absent those instructions, Cheliax most certainly could have gotten compliance out of Keltham, regardless of his society's silly pretense of a godlike immunity to threats -</p>
            <p>And now Keltham is thinking about how the other possibility would've played out, whether he could commit suicide using a Create Water cantrip or other tools that his god could unilaterally give him.&nbsp; But Cheliax could just raise you, then, poor fool; Miracle doesn't require consent.&nbsp; The only danger would be if Abadar could instruct Osirion to raise Keltham before Cheliax could, and Cheliax would know it was in a race and they would have that information first -</p>
            <p><em>Now</em> Keltham is also thinking about Raise Dead, and thinking about the story Carissa gave him about oaths, and how he could if necessary break an oath over something trivial, unilaterally in a way that nobody else depended on so it wouldn't actually violate the ~~~~~~~~~~, and so go to Abaddon.</p>
            <p>Keltham expects to - just end up somewhere else, if he did that?&nbsp; But he knows he might not and this doesn't faze him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>He'd literally rather go to Abaddon than comply.</em>&nbsp; True death doesn't scare him as much as it scares some dath ilani, he's thinking now, and - he's not even imagining Cheliax severely torturing him in a scary way to which he'd prefer nonexistence, the thought that they could break him with torture still hasn't <em>occurred </em>to him, he'd just <em>walk out on this entire universe and existence itself rather than accept a forced unfair division of gains from trade,</em> because if you can't do that, why would anybody bother bargaining fairly with you.</p>
            <p>He wouldn't actually have been able to do it, if Cheliax was running Detect Thoughts on him, and not otherwise restrained by Asmodeus.&nbsp; They've ever had experience with uncooperative torture victims.&nbsp; You don't instantly end up in Abaddon and instantly get eaten.</p>
            <p>...but maybe, just maybe, Abrogail feels the tiniest shred of respect for Keltham at this point.&nbsp; That degree of 'fuck you' is something she can appreciate.</p>
            <p>Of course now she wants even more to see what Keltham's mind would look like when it broke, but Asmodeus said not to do that so she won't.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>See, Keltham's lips are moving again and Carissa's getting confused about the nature of Good and Evil again, it's getting to be a pattern. Lastwall wouldn't hand her over, probably - why? 'simplifies cooperation with people like Keltham' jumps to mind as an explanation with Fox's Cunning up, in a way it wouldn't jump to mind otherwise. But obviously the Good gods do sacrifice people to horrible fates to achieve their goals ....what's the difference? Is it just that Good gets incredibly worked up about rape in particular?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Why did Asmodeus tell them to cooperate with Keltham? It's one of three important glaring confusions right now, along with "what is Maillol in trouble for" because Carissa suspects she's probably in trouble for the same thing, even if they're going to punish them one at a time about it, and "what does Cayden Cailean want" which she's trying not to think about but which feels salient since they're talking about, you know, Good and whether they sacrifice people to be raped if it achieves their long goals...</p>

The palace found one inside four hours. <em>One</em>, not <em>two;</em> there isn't an invisible person with Detect Thoughts somewhere telepathically bonded to Isidre and passing along Carissa's thoughts with impressively little delay. There isn't a random countess Carissa's never heard of who's read all the project transcripts.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There's just Her Imperial Majestrix, certainly the highest Splendour they could find on such short notice. Presumably not literally just here to fuck with Carissa, that'd be taking pride a little far, but certainly going to fuck with Carissa while she's here. As she is entitled to. Because she can do whatever she wants.</p>
            <p>(Carissa isn't exactly surprised by, but does admire, the perfectly straight face 'Isidre' has been keeping for the last twenty seconds.)</p>

            <p>The second thought is to ask whether this rumor is perhaps true.</p>
            <p>It admittedly&nbsp;<em>does in fact</em> sound a lot more like the sort of thing that would be passed around six-year-old kids, than would make very much sense in real life, but&nbsp;<em>even in Golarion,</em> presumably, the people who pass around rumors like that are probably running their own sanity checks&nbsp;<em>at all,</em> and think it's not completely obviously false?</p>
            <p>"Does the rumor say it's consensual or a pharaoh-of-Osirion situation?" Keltham inquires.&nbsp; He is putting any flashes of anger on hold pending evaluation of probabilities.</p>

            <p>...Carissa's model of Aspexia Rugatonn is&nbsp;<em>still not happy about that plan&nbsp;</em>and oh, yep, that'd be why Maillol's in trouble, he waded into a Church-Crown conflict.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Tonia Barrero, when he asked her, under truthspell, what questions somebody in his position ought to ask somebody under truthspell, listed, 'What sort of person is the Queen of Cheliax', and said a few things that didn't - make much sense at the time, and then said she didn't know much more, in which case, why did she bring up the question - he should have asked her <em>that,</em> in retrospect, but he was very uncomfortable with the maybe-arguably-at-best-semiconsensual-pseudo-mind-reading situation and wanted to get out of it early.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa was braced for the Queen to say a bunch of flattering nonsense that has nothing to do with the real reason which is that Asmodeus chose her. Or, well, maybe Asmodeus choosing her was related to her understanding the Law better than almost anyone, but, realistically, it was probably a combination of that plus being attractive to Keltham plus being a heretic in a coincidentally useful direction -</p>
            <p>- anyway. Obviously the Queen of Cheliax doesn't like Carissa for the traits that Carissa values most in herself. It would be pathetic to believe that. It would be pathetic to believe even if it's being spoken into your ears with very high Splendour by someone who would know. Carissa is not pathe- okay, Carissa<em> is</em> pathetic, Carissa has spent like five percent of her mental motions this conversation on being happy that Keltham is protective of her, you can't do that and then claim you're not pathetic, but Carissa's not <em>that&nbsp;</em>pathetic. The Queen wants Carissa because she can't have her, and Carissa's personality has very little to do with it, because one doesn't show that much personality while being horribly tortured anyway and the thing the Queen wants to do with Carissa is horribly torture her. This is the not pathetic thing to believe and Carissa believes it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But it's true that she had the highest spellcraft at her Worldwound installation. And it's kind of nice that Cheliax did have that written down somewhere. (Unless they didn't, and learned it from her irritably thinking it earlier today, which now that she thinks about it seems likelier.)</p>
            <p>And it's true that she understands something no one else did, which made Asmodeus choose her.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>....and it's true that he'd have done that even if there were only a tiny chance she did anything useful, and that if she fails he won't care if the Queen turns her into a statue and she never ever ever exists again. Stop being pathetic you will be&nbsp;<em>gone&nbsp;</em>you won't&nbsp;<em>exist&nbsp;</em>the stakes are&nbsp;<em>much&nbsp;</em>too high to be that&nbsp;<em>contemptible&nbsp;</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Carissa exists because she might serve Asmodeus and might serve Cheliax, and she intends to try to do that, and she does not have any feelings at all.</p>

            <p>- no! You're bad at understanding where Keltham understands selection to be operating, it's over<em> entire universes.&nbsp;</em>More urgently, the thing to say here is 'I suppose I appreciate you presenting so clear a test of whether your theory is true. I....hope very much that it isn't, but if the Queen of Cheliax ends up inevitably in conflict with you then we'll prepare you for the betrayal of a Kuthite spy; I don't need to understand the patterns to acknowledge that if they're making good predictions they might keep doing that.'</p>

            <p>"In dath ilan, we have systems of revocable delegation that people can use to aggregate into much larger political factions in a way that remains legible at every level of organization.&nbsp; Among its other uses, this permits Civilization to annually form a Masculine Faction and Feminine Faction to negotiate with each other about what common masculine and feminine behaviors should be, not one standard for everyone, but pieces you can make your own behavior out of and have them be quickly describable to others and mesh well with other standard behaviors.&nbsp; Like, grandmothers are one subkind of women and grandfathers are one subkind of men, that sort of thing.&nbsp; This requires real Lawfulness and therefore shouldn't be able to exist in Golarion, and therefore all of your notions of what grandmothers and grandfathers should be like, must come from somewhere else -"</p>
            <p>"I'm probably digressing here, my point is, you're describing something weird enough that I'm trying to fall back to basics and make sure of my foundations.&nbsp; You are describing a system in which somebody, usually a man, does something with a second person, usually a woman, that falls into a standard pattern that they both understand, and which some third party therefore also understands."</p>
            <p>"That system of meshing behavior patterns is that the party of the second part -" Taldane please, you can't use that many syllables for <em>that,</em> your contracts would be infinity pages long.</p>
            <p>"That meshing-pattern system is that Two tells One that One can do whatever One wants with Two.&nbsp; After which One rents out some of Two's time to Three, but it's not that Two is anything like a rentable resource that One rents into a market for Twos, it's that One and Two and Three all think that's hot.&nbsp; And maybe also Two likes to trade oral sex for footrubs and Three likes to give footrubs and One does not like to give footrubs, and usually you'd just solve this problem by Two and Three forming a secondary or tertiary relationship," like normal sane people do when monogamy isn't working for someone, "but if Two gave themselves fully to One, then One is supposed to decide who Two fucks, so One being able to demand money for that from Three, is a symbol of how One still has all the Two and hasn't given any of it back to Two to use, or Three paying One is symbolic of how much Three isn't taking away some of what Two gave One, Three is paying One for it.&nbsp; Is that about right?"</p>
