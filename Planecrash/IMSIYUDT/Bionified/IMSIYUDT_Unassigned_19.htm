            <p>Though at least, Governance continuing to pressure him about that, mildly suggests that they're not just teleporting sperm out of his epididymis... well, no, it probably wouldn't survive in the uterus's acidic environment if not mixed with protective seminal fluid, though maybe you could put it directly into the more basic environment past the cervix?&nbsp; Not grabbing the results when he gets oral sex and inserting into vaginas under cover of invisibility, anyways.</p>
            <p>Though if they were doing <em>that,</em> they'd be clever enough to go on exerting the same amount of social pressure on him afterwards so he wouldn't get suspicious.&nbsp; But mostly, it sort of seems like Cheliax doesn't really have the optimizing spirit that would do either.</p>

            <p><em>Two. &nbsp;You know what you did.</em></p>
            <p><em>Three.&nbsp; Listening to your thoughts is becoming more painful than amusing.&nbsp; You are not saving yourself any trouble by sending your thoughts scurrying in frantic circles every time I come up in them. &nbsp;You are who you are, you can't actually hide it from me, and you'll earn however much suffering that earns you.&nbsp; Lose hope, give up, and endure.</em></p>
            <p>At the bottom of the parchment is a set of punishment codes describing a moderately severe half-hour session in a temple torture chamber, requiring it to be taken at the recipient's choice of time sometime over the next three days.</p>

            <p>It could almost be a dath ilani poem from some layer of some virtue, though he does not know which virtue it would correspond to.&nbsp; There is a spirit in it that is not in any poem he can remember having heard before, something that comes to it from the way that it is a relation between a mortal and something larger than that, being trusted.</p>
            <p>He closes his eyes and imagines it, he doesn't bother with imagining a better world drawn in grains of sand, the better world his god draws is drawn in grains of people, agents all over the world interacting with each other.&nbsp; Their actions scattered and uncoordinated, for now, stepping on each other and hurting each other, for now, but there are other actions they could take instead that would make all of them better off, fairly.</p>
            <p>He imagines himself as one of those grains, one of those people, and if this was going to be a realistic metaphor he should be a special one, maybe, except that right now he's not.&nbsp; Just one of all the people in Golarion hoping for this war to end quickly, and contributing the tiny little action that is cheering their god on; if they all do that, they'll all be better off.&nbsp; Keltham visualizes a grain like any other, to represent himself.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa closes her eyes and prays for Asmodeus to win.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It's a sincere prayer, obviously. She does not like Zon-Kuthon and she believes in the project Zon-Kuthon was willing to blow up everything in order to oppose.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She's definitely some flavor of heretic at this point. She isn't sure what flavor. She assumes they're mostly monitoring for whether she's about to betray the project, and she's not, she believes in the project with as much conviction as she can recall ever having felt for anything that isn't the continued survival of Carissa Sevar. Which is also served by the project succeeding. But there was a set of stories meant to point people like her in the right direction, and she knew they were lies, and now she had to face what specifically they were lies about, and learn a new set, which are also lies, but lies better suited to the position she finds herself in now, and -</p>
            <p>- she knows she can't handle the truth. She knows that even in dath ilan there's the concept not everyone can handle every truth, she knows it's possible to learn the Law even when many truths are hidden from you. But she's slightly worried that until she invents evil dath ilan thinking herself everything'll ring a bit wrong, not quite crafted for a mortal mind in the particular fragile place Carissa finds herself in.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Except, maybe, advice for little children about prayer. Slightly adjusted advice, no one ever told Carissa Asmodeus was trying to craft a better world. That's still true. It's true to Keltham, too, it landed, meant something, and she can worry later about what that means for the plan where they seduce him into Evil, it seems just as important to their plans that they find the bits of their own teaching that feel true even to dath ilan.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She imagines herself a grain of sand in the grand designs of Asmodeus, and strives to be placed where she'd needed, and fierce in remaining there, no matter what interference of other gods or other grains of sand, and hopes that Asmodeus can see, from where he stands, something beautiful and right and strong and Lawful that can be built of mortal building blocks.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Zon-Kuthon is losing too quickly.</p>
            <p>Zon-Kuthon is a god; and depending on how you count it, either a very old entity, or something built out of the corpse of something that old.&nbsp; He models reality, therefore, entirely in probability distributions.&nbsp; He has no mortal heritage of any other way of seeing.</p>
            <p>When this war began Zon-Kuthon formed a probability distribution over how long the fight should take, and gambled on a chance to drag it out long enough to ruin the crops and visit misery on a generation.&nbsp; But He is losing too fast, in the unreasonably far tails of that probability distribution, especially given the further information He now has about the war's participants.</p>
            <p>The external-demigod-assembling fragments that Zon-Kuthon deliberately set to reunite with Himself quickly and early in predictable locations, to act as tests of the theory that all His longer-buried fragments are being hunted and destroyed somehow, returned to Him.&nbsp; And yet Zon-Kuthon... does not have an ominous intuition, He was never that mortal.&nbsp; He has rather the hypothesis that Nethys is opposing Him, that this is the reason for His losing too quickly, and the implication that, if so, His longer-buried external-demigod-assembling fragments will be gone.</p>
            <p>He randomizes, then, with far too much power, in a way that Nethys can of course see but should not be able to <em>foresee </em>with prophecy shattered; and based on the result makes an expensive calculation of where something will be while its trajectory is still complicated; He focuses much of Himself someplace it is not at all convenient for Him to be, losing ground in the war as He does; and there He finds that His external-demigod-assembling fragment that should have been flitting through that location is gone.</p>
            <p>He knows, then, He understands the betrayal and that Nethys it was who worked it all upon Him from the beginning.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>And what does Zon-Kuthon do, when He is betrayed?</p>
            <p>Mostly, of course, Zon-Kuthon does what serves Zon-Kuthon's longest purposes of pain, misery, terror, mutilation, woe.</p>
            <p>But if there were a tiebreaker between two strategies - if there is some little thing that Zon-Kuthon can do along the way -&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Then Dou-Bral, if He had been so betrayed, would have done some last thing He could to work vengeance on His betrayer.</p>
            <p>And all that Dou-Bral was, Zon-Kuthon is not.</p>
            <p>Nethys is betraying Him?&nbsp; Of course He is.&nbsp; How amusing.&nbsp; No doubt Zon-Kuthon will be the first of many.&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon then will tell nothing to the other gods of how Nethys has begun the series of downfalls that will inevitably lead to Their own destruction, destruction more complete than Zon-Kuthon's mere sealing.&nbsp; Whoever currently thinks they are Nethys's ally will find themselves mistaken; Zon-Kuthon can guess, of course, that Nethys is probably trying to side with fellow gods who also once were mortal, but Nethys being Nethys, the road that has been started down is one from which Nethys is unlikely to be able to turn back.</p>
            <p>It is not a certainty, obviously, this beautiful vision.&nbsp; But the probability is one to gamble on; and a better gamble than the one where Zon-Kuthon announces Nethys's sins, in which case there is not much chance&nbsp;at all&nbsp;of lasting damage to the world and misery to the gods.</p>
            <p>He will go into the vault, then, for a time, and say nothing of Nethys's betrayal.&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon has been exiled once before, after all, and it did not last.&nbsp; Evil stays contained less long than one might hope.&nbsp; If Nethys brings enough ruin to the gods, the vault will last even less.<br><br></p>
            <p>Zon-Kuthon's pieces begin to gather into the vault. &nbsp;They will not slay Him; they need Him to counterbalance Asmodeus yet.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Four simultaneous expensive and exhausting strikes, delivered with extreme calculation, striking where not many gods can see, destroying four key subassemblies whose encrypted nature is that they pin the true center of Zon-Kuthon, landing just as the vault door is almost sealed shut.</p>
            <p><br>It is possible that this will kill Zon-Kuthon.</p>
            <p>It is also possible that Dou-Bral is still in there somewhere, and will be able to free Himself at last.</p>
            <p>Either way, the process will take a while. &nbsp;Nobody is liable to notice, or reason through that it wasn't just a result of divine combat, if Zon-Kuthon's clerics lose only their ninth-circle spells at first. &nbsp;It will be longer yet before His clerics lose their eighth-circle spells as well.</p>
            <p>It's going to hurt Zon-Kuthon the entire time He's dying, which isn't particularly desirable, but is also an acceptable price to pay.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p><em>I was not responsible for the anomaly leaving the containment</em> <em>zone,</em> Asmodeus sends back to Her.&nbsp; With Otolmens it is necessary to explain many things that other gods would simply deduce for themselves.&nbsp; <em>I did not choose it.&nbsp; I did not expect it.</em></p>
            <p><em>Zon-Kuthon, a known existential threat, attacked the exact location where my mortal followers had secured and contained the anomaly.</em></p>
            <p><em>My anomaly-storing followers validly deduced that this meant that Zon-Kuthon knew about the anomaly, knew where the anomaly was being stored, and was targeting the anomaly.</em></p>
            <p><em>They knew that if Zon-Kuthon had attacked the anomaly at this location before, Zon-Kuthon might attack the same location again, more forcefully, and perhaps breach containment.</em></p>
            <p><em>They therefore moved the anomaly to an even more protected location which Zon-Kuthon might not know to target, though they are protecting it without trying to make that assumption.</em></p>
            <p><em>Since You had only recently declared the containment zone and I was busy containing known existential threat Zon-Kuthon, my followers did not know, while making this decision, that they were leaving Your containment zone in their choice of new location.</em></p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Indeed!&nbsp; <em>Unfortunately </em>the installation of interdiction fields requires Asmodeus's followers to use up scarce, expensive resources!&nbsp; Before the war started, Asmodeus's followers were able to install the previous interdiction field over the anomaly's previous location, at great expense to themselves; this, in fact, is the only reason why existential threat Zon-Kuthon's mortal followers do not <em>already</em> have the anomaly in their possession.</p>
            <p>Now, however, in addition to having already used up many resources on the previous interdiction field, Asmodeus's followers are at war with Zon-Kuthon's followers to help prevent further existential threat from any previous plans Zon-Kuthon has laid.&nbsp; This will be grindingly expensive to Asmodeus's followers.</p>
            <p>They cannot afford to lay a new interdiction field while the war is still continuing, so they stored the anomaly inside a previously built interdiction field with existing heavy security.</p>

            <p><br>Perhaps Otolmens could contact a Chaotic Good god, such as, for example, Cayden Cailean, and ask that god to suggest a service that Otolmens could perform for Asmodeus that would be fair compensation for Asmodeus's followers doing something very expensive for them, during the ongoing war with Nidal.&nbsp; Do not mention the part about the anomaly, of course, because neither of Us wants any more gods paying attention to it.</p>
            <p>Whatever Cayden Cailean suggests will not be a Lawful Evil trap, and if it's any sort of Chaotic Good trap, Asmodeus will warn Otolmens of that!</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>(Manipulating Otolmens to a particular conclusion that She is allowed to reach is easier than with other gods, because Otolmens does not try to be less predictable; it is unfortunate that most of the conclusions one might desire from Her are ones She will not reach by any pathway.<br><br></p>
            <p>There is, very clearly, a plot afoot, one that has just resulted in a god's downfall.&nbsp; Asmodeus wants to know what that plot is, whether Asmodeus's interests are a primary target of it, who exactly is behind it.</p>
            <p>He needs information.</p>
            <p>He has a list of suspects.</p>
            <p>Who is known to already know about, and have acted around, the anomaly?&nbsp; Abadar, Nethys, Otolmens, Irori, Cayden Cailean.</p>
            <p>Otolmens need not be considered.</p>
            <p>In the case that Asmodeus's interests are being targeted by the plot, Abadar would not have originally reached out to Asmodeus with a poisoned trade; Abadar retaliates, in such matters, but does not attack.&nbsp; Also the whole thing is not really Abadar's style.</p>
            <p>The remaining gods involved, Cayden Cailean, Nethys, and Irori, are all former mortals.&nbsp; Formerly mortal gods do tend to be more interventionist in mortal matters, and so more likely to appear there, but still.&nbsp; The thought has not escaped Asmodeus that perhaps there is some common interest of the gods who were once human, opposed to the interests of the gods who never were.</p>
            <p>Who else was clearly involved?</p>
            <p>Gorum, Chaotic Neutral god of battle, who suddenly switched sides about whether Zon-Kuthon should be allowed to roam free.&nbsp; Gorum being Gorum, He might not demand to know all about it, it is not in the nature of War that all soldiers must understand why they fight; but whoever contacted Him and successfully brought Him on board was probably somebody whose purpose Gorum finds sympathetic.</p>
            <p>Iomedae is formerly human, and her work often conduces to Gorum's ends.&nbsp; And Iomedae now holds the key to a certain vault.&nbsp; But Iomedae will only use that key under certain rigidly defined conditions; holding it does not clearly benefit Her by much.</p>
            <p>And if you consider this entire plot, it does look, a bit, more in the style of Chaos than of Law, or at most Neutral on that axis.&nbsp; To be a god is not to have the nature of carrying out strategies that some third party might see as nothing but otherwise-featureless choices of paths to final consequences; if that were so, there would be little overt difference between Lawful and Chaotic ones.&nbsp; Gods drink more deeply than that, of their own natures, and Lawful gods make Lawful plans and Chaotic gods make Chaotic ones.</p>
            <p>Asmodeus will see, then, what Milani, formerly-mortal Chaotic Good goddess of revolution, will do, given a prompt to meddle in this particular issue, and perhaps that will prove revealing.)</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Oh?&nbsp; Clever of Her.</p>
            <p>Well, Asmodeus is being, in fact, pretty straightforward for once, more straightforward than He'd be with anyone who wasn't Otolmens.</p>
            <p>Otolmens asked for Asmodeus to tell His followers to do something very expensive in the middle of their war with Nidal.&nbsp; It would cost them somewhere in the vicinity of 100,000 gold pieces, more than 50,000gp, less than 200,000gp.</p>
            <p>Asmodeus does not think that this matter is going to destroy the world and is not going to do this out of the charity of His heart.</p>
            <p>Asmodeus wants to be paid.&nbsp; He's not going to mess with Otolmens, because Otolmens, but He wants to be paid.</p>
            <p>That's it.&nbsp; Look at how legible Asmodeus is being about how He didn't set Otolmens up for this, didn't secretly prompt Her into making the request, and isn't trying to sneakily make His mortals do anything more expensive.</p>
            <p>If Milani could suggest a straightforward trade and service for Otolmens to do, that Asmodeus will accept, without being particularly Chaotic or Good about it which Asmodeus will NOT accept, then Milani would be doing Her proper part to help out Otolmens, just as Asmodeus is not trying to pull anything complicated on Her.</p>
            <p>As for specifics beyond that, Asmodeus will not discuss Otolmens's affairs without Her consent, lest even more gods meddle in them.</p>

            <p><em>I propose in particular that you legibly exhibit to Me your honest expectation of how long the war with Nidal will otherwise last and how much it will otherwise cost; our compact will call for You to pay Me for how much better for Cheliax the war ends up going, compared to that expectation, after I suggest my proposed service to Otolmens.&nbsp; You will pay me for improvements as they become nearly certain, however, rather than waiting for the war to end.&nbsp; I would commit not to using those payments to work against Your interests; not everything that I want is something you hate.</em></p>
            <p><em>One similarly observes that although You derive similar pleasure from torturing most of the souls in your possession, there are in truth some souls' tortures that I find more tragic than others, even though they are all tragic.&nbsp; If Cheliax ends up with a counterfactually larger population compared to what You expected, after Otolmens's intervention suggested by me - due to their increased counterfactual wealth and hence population growth, or their conquest of other territories - the compact would call for You to instruct Cheliax to use fewer of certain tactics and techniques that you designed specifically to lead good people into damnation.&nbsp; If the payment cannot be made up that way, it can be made up in relaxations of other Chelish policies designed at producing damnations of people who are not, in fact, particularly evil.&nbsp; I would also accept payment in the form of stays of torment for souls of my choice in Hell.</em></p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodeus has many thoughts about this; even this fraction of His mind is large and has room for many thoughts inside it.&nbsp; Among those thoughts is that this compact would happen to benefit Milani a great deal more if, for some reason, Asmodeus had otherwise underestimated how well the war with Nidal would go for Cheliax; and Milani, somehow, knew about this, when Asmodeus did not.</p>
            <p>It is still relatively good news about whether Milani - and some conspiracy that She is part of - is mainly plotting something directly and irrevocably opposed to Asmodeus's interests; unless, of course, that is exactly what Milani wants Asmodeus to think.</p>
            <p>Asmodeus responds with a counter-proposal.&nbsp; It has much more stringent definitions of exactly what kind of counterfactual improvements will be said to be traceable to Milani's particular suggestion for Otolmens's intervention.&nbsp; He is not willing to include all the knock-on effects, just in case Milani has something up Her sleeve in one of them.</p>
            <p>(The overcomplicated terms are designed to exclude, in passing, improvements in war conditions and of Cheliax's health that go through Otolmens's service but <em>also</em> passed through whatever has His squirrels in the anomaly's immediate vicinity so excited.&nbsp; Asmodeus <em>has</em> noticed them becoming more excited, over the last couple of days.</p>
            <p>If Milani rejects that part - or suggests overcomplicated modifications in return that would again count knock-on benefits passing through whatever-excited-His-squirrels - Asmodeus will have a much clearer idea of what is going on.)</p>
            <p>The part about stays of torment for souls in Hell is, of course, entirely unacceptable.&nbsp; The crushing inevitability and hopelessness is really part of the whole point there.&nbsp; Though Asmodeus supposes that Milani could suggest some very, very high rate of conversion between new souls added and old souls stayed, with temporary stays of torment doomed to end.</p>
            <p>(If Milani suggests an astronomical but reachable rate, it will suggest that, for some reason, Her target is a particular soul in Hell, and the rest of this is just an elaborate ruse to disguise it.&nbsp; Asmodeus doesn't know&nbsp;<em>why</em> Milani would do that, it seems more Stupid Good than Chaotic Good, but it's among the many many possibilities that Asmodeus is considering for what might really be going on.)</p>
            <p>Also Asmodeus is not going to integrate the expected benefits over infinite time to be paid out immediately because Asmodeus is not three minutes old.</p>

            <p>It involves exactly the sort of overcomplicated amendments to Asmodeus's amendments that you might expect from somebody who had no idea what the original amendments had really been about, but didn't want to admit that.&nbsp; The new set of overcomplications do still happen to exclude any knock-on effects of Otolmens's service that pass through Keltham's project.</p>
            <p>Milani suggests a conversion rate of 36 counterfactual souls expected to be added over the next 100 years, per 1 soul's torment stayed now for up to 100 years; but the stays will pass through Erecura, the Lawful Neutral goddess who now resides within Dis as Dispater's consort, and Asmodeus Himself will not know who is targeted by them, nor may He attempt to find out, nor may those stayed be told by Hell how they came to be so blessed.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Policy in Dis is to take reasonably good care of souls awaiting resurrection; it doesn't do to have them return to life desperate to escape Hell for real at any cost. Accordingly the contract devil who owns Asmodia has her copying spell diagrams which can't be typeset, for books of magic. The working conditions are pleasant, for Hell. There is a light that Asmodia can fuel with her blood, and which bathes the workspace with a pleasant golden glow bright enough to copy by without straining one's eyes. The chair is not uncomfortable; that makes scribes slower. There are, of course, no breaks, because petitioners do not need to eat or sleep; if Asmodia is too slow to finish a page she is simply encouraged to drink a potion that'll aid her concentration.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The potions are painful, of course. But Asmodia is, if wholly uninteresting herself, adjacent to something interesting, and so her contract devil told her in a friendly sort of voice the secret to making the potions much less painful. It's that they separate, left on the shelf, into an oily top layer and a magically active bottom layer. It's the top layer that causes the agonizing pain, and if it's dumped out on the ground the potion won't work, but it's all right if it's fed to a different person than the one drinking the rest. (Hell's alchemists worked very diligently to achieve this effect.) Since, at the moment, the contract devil is feeling generous with Asmodia, she may go out and feed the potion-tops to some of the less useful apprentices, or if she's ahead of schedule on her scribing she may go all the way out to the waterfront and feed the first sip of the potion to the conscious, petrified angels that are spaced regularly for decor. You know, as a treat. There are many treats in Hell for the obedient.&nbsp;</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>They haven't told her how long it's been.&nbsp; It feels like it's been days.&nbsp; So - probably it's been fewer days.&nbsp; They'll still probably raise her.&nbsp; They'll still probably raise her.</p>
            <p>She's not ahead of schedule on her scribing.&nbsp; Being good at math isn't the same as being fast at writing.&nbsp; She would obviously go feed the potion-tops to the petrified angels if she had time, to show what a good soul she is.</p>
            <p>But Asmodia doesn't have time, so right now she's feeding the potion-top to a less useful apprentice, one very close to her own desk, but not the closest one in case that was some sort of trap for lazy girls.&nbsp; She has no idea who this boy was in life, he looks young but could easily have been here for a hundred years for all she knows, his tongue is burned away and reburned by the line of potions he regularly drinks.&nbsp; What happens to him if he doesn't drink the potions, Asmodia doesn't know.&nbsp; He's chained to his desk and can't stop her, doesn't try to stop her, each time she pours one of the potion-tops into his mouth.&nbsp; Maybe he thinks Asmodia is authorized to do whatever she wants to him, maybe he doesn't realize he could fight back, maybe he isn't in fact allowed to fight back at anything done to him, Asmodia doesn't know.</p>
            <p>Asmodia wouldn't waste any time on pitying him even if there was any pity left in her nature.&nbsp; There's very little doubt that copying spell diagrams for distribution in Cheliax is one of the best jobs in Hell, optimized mostly around maximum production for Cheliax and hence unable to distract the petitioners too much from relatively delicate work.&nbsp; Asmodia's going to be retrained into a contract devil when she dies and that will be much much worse.&nbsp; If she could get this boy's position for herself, when she dies, by throwing him into a lake of fire to burn there forever, there's no doubt she'd do that too.&nbsp; Maybe that's how the boy got his position, by being extra good and doing horrible things to somebody like her.</p>
            <p>She hates him.&nbsp; He's so much better off than she'll be.&nbsp; The passive way he accepts her torments feels like he's mocking her, like he's suppressing a smile knowing how much worse she'll get hers, in time.</p>
            <p>Asmodia asks her contract devil if she's allowed to hurt that boy more for any kind of extra credit, if she has only a little extra time in her schedule but not enough to go feed petrified angels.&nbsp; She doesn't want to waste potions by feeding him extra potion-tops.</p>
            <p>They'll still probably raise her.&nbsp; They'll still probably raise her.</p>

            <p>What's going to happen to her, now?&nbsp; The devil was very right, she can't handle existing.&nbsp; There are people who do well in Hell and more people who do well in relatively light amounts of Hell and it unfortunately turns out that Asmodia is not either of those kinds of people.&nbsp; She's defective, she gets that, somebody should switch her off.</p>
            <p>They'll still probably raise her.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She's still not sure if it was in fact a good idea to push Keltham on the Second Law and on being more sadistic, she's not sure she'll know for a while if it was the right call or not. She understands the Second Law stuff better now (though she's still hoping she'll get it better still once she sees the transcripts) but she suspects it's not something she can use to do anything, making the universe look more like a sex story will also make Keltham wonder if Cheliax is doing that on purpose, besides how it involves lying and lying remains very dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The whole thing might have gone better without the Queen involving herself but - Carissa's not actually sure. It's not as if there are a lot of agenda-free eighth circle casters who understand the project well enough to get through a conversation with Keltham at all. And the Queen's agenda right now seems to involve convincing Keltham that Carissa is very valuable, which does feel nice. Even though it's probably false. And even though Carissa's pretty sure that anyone else would've assigned a milder punishment for what was admittedly a very insubordinate thought but she's been&nbsp;<em>having her thought transcripts read by the Queen and by high-ranking Church officials for several days now while trying to run a sensitive operation&nbsp;</em>and she actually thinks most people would have had, like, two insubordinate thoughts. Or even three.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"I was born in Corentyn. It's a city on the same coast as Ostenso, but pretty far, five hundred miles or so, right where the Inner Sea opens up into the ocean. My father is a merchant; he works out what cargo will be sent in his ships to other cities, and what they'll trade for there, and he sells foreign goods to merchants in Corentyn and sells Chelish goods far away. I have a half-brother who's going to take over the business from him someday. That's how it's normally done; there's a lot of accumulated expertise no one's written down, so you teach your children. Teach your sons, until pretty recently. My mother is a wizard and when she met my father was doing odd wizard work, a step up from laundry - daily cooling spells for people who don't like the summer heat, Comprehend Languages to translate for merchants, that kind of thing.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When I was young there was a civil war, and that's when the Queen signed her compact with Hell and formed modern Cheliax, though I don't remember much about it, except that the ships were impressed for moving soldiers around and my father was very annoyed about it, and parts of the city where we didn't live got destroyed. My mother kept me home and tried to teach me magic. After the war the church opened up a school for wizards in Corentyn and my mother got a job as a teacher there and I tested in, and did very well, and when I graduated was encouraged to enlist in the Chelish army and go fight at the Worldwound, because it'd be best for my growth as a wizard and paid very generously and was also necessary to prevent the destruction of the world, which even Evil people care about typically. So I enlisted, and I've served six years now, with a year off in between three-year terms. I planned to stay until I hit fourth circle, because I want to be fourth-circle, and I knew in my heart I might actually stay until I hit <em>fifth</em>, because then you can&nbsp;<em>Teleport,&nbsp;</em>and then I was going to open a magic shop in Corentyn and have kids and be rich."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>So Carissa already knows herself well enough to know she'll want children.&nbsp; Well, she's had longer to figure it out than Keltham.&nbsp; Then again, some people younger than Keltham already seem to know...</p>
            <p>...why is he thinking that he doesn't know if he wants children?&nbsp; He was going to become a billionaire and have&nbsp;<em>lots</em> of children.</p>
            <p>It's pretty obvious on reflection that it's because these children will be real.</p>
            <p>"I was born in Default, the city you're born in when you're not born anywhere particularly interesting, because your parents don't have any particular reason to be anywhere else and so they might as well live where everybody else lives; it's the largest dath ilani city in the world, and the center of Governance is there but not in the center.&nbsp; I got the usual education, but with fewer persistent friendships over time with other children, because my parents moved around a lot.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom is that more persistent friendships are better, in childhood, but my parents basically waved it off because they thought I'd be pretty much all right even if they didn't optimize every single aspect of my childhood as hard as possible.&nbsp; I agree with them about that, but one still gets the impression that all of their friends were horrified.&nbsp; In that dath ilani way where you're privately horrified but conceal the overt signs because, first of all, you don't think that exerting more social pressure will help, and second, they can guess perfectly well that you're horrified.&nbsp; We had a small house-module, maybe something like a tenth or twentieth the size of the villa that got burned down."</p>
            <p>"I'm not sure at exactly what point it became clear to them that I was a little different than the other children, but it must have definitely been apparent at the point where I got - one of the elaborate tests that children get, in dath ilan, which aren't just there to measure us, but also to provide the results for the prediction markets that say what will happen in Civilization's future - anyways, I apparently ran across a lightly injured adult who needed me to get help, and I helped him, but I wanted to be paid for helping.&nbsp; I think that was when my parents decided that they'd made a mistake by assortatively mating with each other to select on the quality of reserving a little more of their life for themselves, and moving a lot if they wanted to do that, even if it meant their child's life was less than perfectly optimal; I was more selfish than either of them, which doesn't always happen, in a heritage-mating setup like that one, but happens sometimes.&nbsp; And dath ilan - when you're different, if it's something they can live with at all, they'll do what they can to make life in Civilization easier for you, despite you being different, because everyone is different, somehow, somewhere, everyone needs exceptions.&nbsp; My parents did the very correct thing, then, and sort of gently tried to offer me opportunities to be more Good, if I wanted to be, but without suggesting that I couldn't still just be Evil if I wanted.&nbsp; They argued with me about it, and tried to argue me into being Good, but only after I started it by trying to argue them into being more Evil."</p>
            <p>"I left home as soon as I could pass the requisite financial maturity and self-governance tests, at thirteen.&nbsp; I set up in a part of Default distant enough that my parents wouldn't visit me often enough to be annoying.&nbsp; I got a very default job - doing a thing you don't have words for, setting up high-precision processes that do things, very mundane high-precision processes though, like some business wanted a tweak made to their high-precision process for selling things," this language <em>really</em> is not going to do 'computer programming' without a&nbsp;<em>long</em> digression, "and put all the money I could into the craziest investments I could find that basically seemed to me like they should work, some went up, some blew up, after five years of that I was ahead of the broader market but very barely.&nbsp; I was hoping to - teach myself, if I kept investing like that, that I'd get good at it."</p>
            <p>"For socialization I had a circle of friends my age writing, a kind of stuff that doesn't exist here, though I did a lot more reading and only enough writing to count, but it meant that when everyone was sitting around in a circle eating whatever people had brought in and talking about everyone's work, that I could keep up and talk about it.&nbsp; I picked that writing circle because their themes were, not quite 'doompunk', not quite, Evil aesthetic, more like supervillainy, but not that really - the point was that they were people who could admire people who were selfish, so long as those people were clearly fictional and they weren't out there being selfish in real life.&nbsp; Which, you know, beats people not even appreciating the aesthetic as an aesthetic.&nbsp; I thought about trying to find a circle of other more selfish people, but always decided against it, because - I didn't want to take it from being my personal identity, to a group identity, it was <em>mine </em>and I didn't actually want to be around five other people doing it slightly differently and have debates about that."</p>
            <p>"Civilization really does try hard to make it possible for people who are different to, just be like that and it's fine and their lives aren't about being different.&nbsp; But a lot of us who are different don't want&nbsp;<em>that</em>, either, we don't just want to pass through it all unnoticed, we feel like we have something to prove, not because Civilization is telling us to prove it, but because we want to prove it anyways.&nbsp; And if what you want is - to be acknowledged for it, to make people admit something, to excel so much that you're above average, Civilization isn't just going to hand that to you.&nbsp; Not everyone can have things that not everyone can have."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>It's not like Golarion is doing incredibly better than dath ilan on the strength of its greater selfishness.</p>
            <p>Keltham elects not to say it out loud, for now.</p>
            <p>"They didn't think I was a mistake, a person that they'd wish they'd never made and brought into the world.&nbsp; Nothing like that.&nbsp; Not even close.&nbsp; They felt they'd made their own wrong life choices that had resulted in me existing, that's not the same as saying that I shouldn't exist, that if there's a button you press to get a Keltham, you don't press the button.&nbsp; They just felt that they could've made other choices and gotten some other result instead, and then they would have felt like they'd made their own choices correctly, not that one possible child would be - more valuable to them than the other, if you put them side by side -"</p>
            <p>"Their lives are also theirs, and their regrets belong to them, and they didn't try to make them be something about me or something of mine."</p>
            <p>A sudden lump comes into his throat, as Keltham realizes, having not quite thought of it before:</p>
            <p><em>Everyone who knows me thinks I'm dead.&nbsp; Really dead.</em></p>
            <p>The Keepers have to know.&nbsp; The Keepers ought to tell anyone who's really broken up about it, right, it shouldn't be <em>that </em>much of an infohazard - that you wouldn't even tell the kid's own parents, he's still alive -</p>
            <p><em>The Keepers will tell them that Keltham is still somewhere, probably many different somewheres but some weighing more than others, and that to say anything about the details is far beyond anything the Keepers can do.&nbsp; The Keepers would not be able to foresee specifics like Golarion.</em></p>
            <p>Dath ilan wouldn't put that much effort into cryosuspending every single person no matter what, if they expected all the selfish sadists to end up in worlds with masochists who give them everything they want.</p>
            <p>Maybe hearing the current state of knowledge is actually worse for somebody than thinking their kid is just gone, because if they're just nonexistent, nothing any worse can be happening to them, and more importantly,&nbsp;<em>you can be done thinking about it at some point.</em></p>
            <p>Maybe the Keepers won't tell his parents, or anybody else who knows him, after all.</p>

            <p>Not that this is necessarily a good thing.&nbsp; Though it could be!&nbsp; Keltham doesn't know.&nbsp; It depends on, you know, the entire state of the entire multiverse that he cannot in fact extrapolate in his tiny little mortal-sized brain.</p>
            <p>But he should maybe not talk about this much until he's tried to figure out the ways in which it will be an enormous infohazard, which, again, it clearly will be, somehow.</p>
            <p>"I suspect that - at the scale where whole universes interact, like that - time might not mean as much, or be as synchronized, as it is in Golarion.&nbsp; If you can see dath ilan from here, if that's at all controllable, then it might be just as easy to see dath ilan's past as what I think of as its present.&nbsp; That could be why Asmodeus wasn't trying to grab anyone else right away, if it was expensive, and if He knew that all that was needed was one dath ilani to get things rolling here, and that, in time, Golarion's Civilization would then ascend to where it could finish the job itself."</p>
            <p>"And if you think about it from the perspective of somebody who died - they just need - someone, somewhere, who's powerful enough, who can see them, and cares.&nbsp; Or is willing to trade with something else that cares."</p>
            <p><em>Some trades stretch across time.</em>&nbsp; It's a saying in dath ilan that usually means something rather different, there: just ordinary time in one world, coordinated trades that parents make with children who don't exist yet or haven't matured as economic agents.</p>
