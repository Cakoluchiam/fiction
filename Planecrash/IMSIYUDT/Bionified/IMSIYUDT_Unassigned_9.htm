          <div class='post-content'><p>And Keltham-the-object snaps into focus to Keltham-the-perceiver.</p>
            <p>His first thought is that Keepers would trade out-of-preference sexual favors or <em>do crimes</em> for this spell.</p>
            <p>His second thought is that there's so many thoughts he hasn't been thinking in the last day.</p>
            <p>His third thought is that this is a mind-affecting drug, one making him think that he can think better and promising epiphanies, even if the rest of his mental processing isn't degraded.&nbsp; There are protocols trained for being hit by mind-affecting drugs like that, which you're supposed to follow even if it seems like you have better ideas for things to do while you're on the mind-affecting drug.</p>
            <p>It takes an additional effort and self-surety for Keltham to override that very trained and solemnly advised protocol, even temporarily.&nbsp; But he can <em>see,</em> even more clearly than he could at other times, that it would be stupid to follow standard protocol and run out of this room immediately.&nbsp; He knows he's more awake right now, and it doesn't matter how many people think they're becoming super awake as they fall asleep and into madness, he can tell the difference.</p>
            <p>He still needs to cast his spells and then leave this room of untrusted others.&nbsp; These are rules that derive strength from their unconditionality; there is some real sense in which even an extremely well-justified exception to them is breaking or bending a piece of the Algorithm that would work better for other people the more unconditional it is, and those people should remember the same thing about that Algorithm.&nbsp; That's even leaving aside where part of his reason for violating these hard-and-fast rules about behaving under conditions of mental oddity, is that he died in a plane crash and has been in a magical world for the last day, which isn't the sort of epistemic state that - he's wasting time.</p>
            <p>"It's up.&nbsp; Dexterity, Haste?"</p>

            <p>While that's going on, you don't let people who aren't Keeper-trained and Keeper-oathbound talk to you. &nbsp;You especially don't talk to people you don't trust an awful lot. &nbsp;You double-especially don't talk to whoever talked you into using the drug or maybe subtly guided you down a path that ended with that decision. &nbsp;There are known drugs that seem to have an effect of permanently relaxing your priors about whatever somebody says to you while you're on drugs, which in dath ilani terms is something like a date rape of the soul. &nbsp;Keltham has had drugs that mimic the more innocuous effects that go along with those, and Owl's Wisdom is absolutely nothing like them, but still.</p>
            <p>All of this is, in any case, advice you'd only need in the first place if you went to a Shop of Ill-Advised Consumer Goods.&nbsp; Or if a criminal dosed you.&nbsp; Dath ilan does not recognize any uses of lysergic acid diethylamide, dimethyltryptamine, or psilocybin, within the mainstream of Well-Advised Consumer Goods. &nbsp;They don't do anything useful that can't be done by a high-ranking Keeper just talking at you.)</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham ducks in and starts writing.&nbsp; Translation spells are a thing, and he's not sure how that interacts with cracking the kiddie's substitution cipher he has memorized, for writing non-readable notes to himself in RPGs and so on.&nbsp; Instead he's going to write down some cultural references from his homeworld, and hope that there's no version of a cultural translation spell that reads through <em>those;</em> Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra, as it were.</p>
            <p>He doesn't have time to think through very much, the first priority is just to write out all the things he hasn't been thinking, notes to himself to hang the thoughts upon, to be followed up later.</p>
            <p><em>Blue and orange,</em> is the first thing he scratches out.&nbsp; There's a constant drumbeat of hints that the people around him operate on a very alien and possibly inhumane morality, and he's been saying things to himself like Carissa was probably making a joke he failed to get, when she talked about tossing the rats into a pit to cannibalize each other and <em>selling tickets to that like people would pay to see it.</em>&nbsp; There's a whole history of little pings like that and his brain pushing back at the dissonance with 'Maybe it was a joke I didn't get?' and he can <em>see </em>that, now, while he's got Owl's Wisdom running.</p>
            <p><em>Subverted True-man Show, </em>he writes out next.&nbsp; The girls all wore permanently cheerful expressions during class, Meritxell and Ione and everyone else didn't read as any less genuine to him than their usual selves read while they were acting out routines, like they were all experienced actresses, like they were all <em>already</em> acting.&nbsp; But they're <em>not </em>running a well-designed full Immersive Reality TV Show trope on him either.&nbsp; If they were really such good actresses, with smart people and smart scripts behind them, they wouldn't be giving that <em>away</em> by wearing permanently cheerful smiles during class, or by not <em>acting awkward</em> when they were called on to act out new weird scenarios.&nbsp; They're not trying to prevent him from realizing that they all have and are using acting abilities like he got from his Charisma boost, which, if they were actually constructing a false reality around him, would be the first thing they'd try to avoid him knowing.</p>
            <p>(Keltham also makes a note in the back of his mind, not for the first time today, that if they don't get adequate Governance support and don't end up with more urgent priorities, inventing ballpoint pens sure seems like it should be a moneymaker.)</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>The next part is - hard for him to write.&nbsp; It feels like it's a betrayal of the person that he'll be, when this temporary boost wears off, to think about this part, to write down the anchor for it.&nbsp; But he can't unsee it, and it's already too late.</p>
            <p>There is a commonly held wisdom, in dath ilan, about the way a human mind is put together, that it is a thing made of little subtle tensions and balances and internal compromises.&nbsp; The human mind being the limited thing that it is, these balances form around your current level of ability to see into yourself and see the implications of what you already know - or not see them, as the case may be.&nbsp; The reason why not everybody runs off to learn all they can from Keepers, the reason why not everyone asks a Keeper to tell them all the answers about themselves, is that this would bring parts of themselves into conflict that were previously living in a more agreeable truce of ignorance.&nbsp; You might not survive as yourself, if you could see yourself.</p>
            <p>Those who say "That which can be destroyed by the truth should be" may continue to walk the Path from there.&nbsp; But not uncommonly, even somebody who sets out along that Path, turns back at some point, and well short of becoming a Keeper.&nbsp; It's not a trivial price, higher for some than others, and there is varying willingness to pay.&nbsp; A lot of the reason why Keepers exist as what they are, is that the people who have large comparative advantages there - in how little they'll be hurt by knowing themselves, or how much they really internally want to keep going anyways - are conceived of by larger society as being paid to throw themselves on that grenade, so others don't have to.&nbsp; And if, to some Keepers, it doesn't feel like much of a grenade at all, they understand that their case is not typical, and are grateful for winning the comparative-advantage lottery.</p>
            <p>Going up by two local standard deviations, in whatever it is that Owl's Wisdom enhances, is something that the current structures of Keltham's personality were never built to withstand.&nbsp; He knows, from up here, because he couldn't&nbsp;<em>stop</em> himself from glancing in that direction, that in dath ilan he would never have had his 144 children.&nbsp; He would have tried to be special and failed and been sad and then maybe gotten an ordinary +0.8sd job and either paid for a child out of that or decided he was too strange and unhappy to have one.</p>
            <p>It's not considered necessary for somebody Keltham's age to go and pay a Keeper to tell them exactly what the probabilities are, about something like that. &nbsp;It's not so much that people are encouraged to lie to themselves, reality forbid, but that people are told it's okay for them not to shove themselves as hard as possible down the Pathway that will dissolve the mistakes their current personality is built out of. &nbsp;That's what <em>Keepers </em>are for. &nbsp;They do it so that not everybody else has to. &nbsp;There are grownups around in Civilization, who can and will speak up if the people less mature are about to make some terrible mistake out of their blindness.&nbsp; So you do not need to rush ahead to be a Keeper if you'd rather be a little less coherent, a little more yourself and your mistakes and your contradictions, a little more human, for a time.</p>
            <p>But it's too late now, for Keltham to go back, because also in the common wisdom is that once you see what it is you weren't letting yourself see - once you <em>know</em> which mistakes your personality is founded upon - or even if you're trying hard not to know it, to the point where it's becoming a big internal battle - well, at that point, you're supposed to give it up.&nbsp; It means that, well, sorry, you <em>are</em> that smart now, like it or not, you <em>are</em> that wise, you&nbsp;<em>did</em> grow up that much whether or not you wished to stay a child for longer; it's time to move on.</p>
            <p>And the part where he was going to fail at his life's goals, in dath ilan, isn't even the important thing that he can't help but see now, about himself; realize now, at this level of wisdom.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>There was a question asked once of some bright children, among whom Keltham was numbered; in a class where he had seemed to be among the oldest and worst performers; a class assembled of kids who were faster than Keltham.</p>
            <p>And young Keltham had, by that time, already seen through some of the Lies Told To Children; he was past his experience with finding that lightly injured adult on his way home.&nbsp; He had learned that children are sometimes put into contrived situations meant to teach them things.&nbsp; Keltham was suspicious already, before the key moment; he had already guessed that he was meant to learn, in this class, something about what it feels like to be surrounded by others faster and more knowledgeable and even younger than you are.</p>
            <p>But in this guess, Keltham proved to be wrong; he was not the one there who was to learn a lesson, that day.</p>
            <p>The class was on self-integrity, and relatedly morals; a class taught directly by a Watcher-over-Children, not entrusted to older children at all.</p>
            <p>And the Watcher told the class a parable about an adult, coming across a child who'd somehow bypassed the various safeguards around a wilderness area, and fallen into a muddy pond, and seemed to be showing signs of drowning (for they'd already been told, then, what drowning looked like).&nbsp; The water, in this parable, didn't look like it would be over their own adult heads.&nbsp; But - in the parable - they'd just bought some incredibly-expensive clothing, costing dozens of their own labor-hours, and less resilient than usual, that would be ruined by the muddy water.</p>
            <p>And the Watcher asked the class if they thought it was right to save the child, at the cost of ruining their clothing.</p>
            <p>Everyone in there moved their hand to the 'yes' position, of course.&nbsp; Except Keltham, who by this point had already decided quite clearly who he was, and who simply closed his hand into a fist, otherwise saying neither 'yes' nor 'no' to the question, defying it entirely.</p>
            <p>The Watcher asked him to explain, and Keltham said that it seemed to him that it was okay for an adult to take an extra quarter-minute to strip off all their super-expensive clothing and <em>then</em> jump in to save the child.</p>
            <p>The Watcher invited the other children to argue with Keltham about that, which they did, though Keltham's first defense, that his utility function was what it was, had not been a friendly one, or inviting of further argument.&nbsp; But they did eventually convince Keltham that, especially if you weren't sure you could call in other help or get attention or successfully drag the child's body towards help, if that child actually did drown - meaning the child's <em>true</em> life was at stake - then it would make sense to jump in right away, <em>not </em>take the extra risk of waiting another quarter-minute to strip off your clothes, and bill the child's parents' insurance for the cost.&nbsp; Or at least, that was where Keltham shifted his position, in the face of that argumentative pressure.</p>
            <p>Some kids, at that point, questioned the Watcher about this actually being a pretty good point, and why <em>wouldn't </em>anyone just bill the child's parents' insurance.</p>
            <p>To which the Watcher asked them to consider hypothetically the case where insurance refused to pay out in cases like that, because it would be too easy for people to set up 'accidents' letting them bill insurances - not that this precaution had proven to be necessary in real life, of course.&nbsp; But the Watcher asked them to consider the Least Convenient Possible World where insurance companies, and even parents, did need to reason like that; because there'd proven to be too many master criminals setting up 'children at risk of true death from drowning' accidents that they could apparently avert and claim bounties on.</p>
            <p>Well, said Keltham, in that case, he was going right back to taking another fifteen seconds to strip off his super-expensive clothes, if the child didn't look like it was <em>literally right about</em> to drown.&nbsp; And if society didn't like that, it was society's job to solve that thing with the master criminals.&nbsp; Though he'd <em>maybe</em> modify that if they were in a possible-true-death situation, because a true life is worth a huge number of labor-hours, and that part did feel like some bit of decision theory would say that everyone would be wealthier if everyone would sacrifice small amounts of wealth to save huge amounts of somebody else's wealth, if that happened unpredictably to people, and if society was also that incompetent at setting up proper reimbursements.&nbsp; Though if it was like that in real life instead of the Least Convenient Possible World, it would mean that Civilization was terrible at coordination and it was time to overthrow Governance and start over.</p>
            <p>This time the smarter kids did not succeed in pushing Keltham away from his position, and after a few more minutes the Watcher called a halt to it, and told the assembled children that they had been brought here today to learn an important lesson from Keltham about self-integrity.</p>
            <p>Keltham is being coherent, said the Watcher.</p>
            <p>Keltham's decision is a valid one, given his own utility function (said the Watcher); you were wrong to try to talk him into thinking that he was making an objective error.</p>
            <p>It's easy for you to say you'd save the child (said the Watcher) when you're not really there, when you don't actually have to make the sacrifice of what you spent so many hours laboring to obtain, and would you all please note how none of you even considered about whether or not to spend a quarter-minute stripping off your clothes, or whether to try to bill the child's parents' insurance.&nbsp; Because you were too busy showing off how Moral you were, and how willing to make Sacrifices.&nbsp; Maybe you would decide not to do it, if the fifteen seconds were too costly; and then, any time you spent thinking about it, would also have been costly; and in that sense it might make more sense given your own utility functions (unlike Keltham's) to rush ahead without taking the time to think, let alone the time to strip off your expensive fragile clothes.&nbsp; But labor does have value, along with a child's life; and it is not incoherent or stupid for Keltham to weigh that too, especially given his own utility function - so said the Watcher.</p>
            <p>Keltham did have enough dignity, by that point in his life, not to rub it in or say 'told you so' to the other children, as this would have distracted them from the process of updating.</p>
            <p>The Watcher spoke on, then, about how most people have selfish and unselfish parts - not selfish and unselfish <em>components in their utility function,</em> but parts of themselves in some less Law-aspiring way than that.&nbsp; Something with a utility function, if it values an apple 1% more than an orange, if offered a million apple-or-orange choices, will choose a million apples and zero oranges.&nbsp; The division within most people into selfish and unselfish components is not like that, you cannot feed it all with unselfish choices whatever the ratio.&nbsp; Not unless you are a Keeper, maybe, who has made yourself sharper and more coherent; or maybe not even then, who knows?&nbsp; For (it was said in another place) it is hazardous to non-Keepers to know too much about exactly how Keepers think.</p>
            <p>It is dangerous to believe, said the Watcher, that you get extra virtue points the more that you let your altruistic part hammer down the selfish part.&nbsp; If you were older, said the Watcher, if you were more able to dissect thoughts into their parts and catalogue their effects, you would have noticed at once how this whole parable of the drowning child, was set to crush down the selfish part of you, to make it look like you would be invalid and shameful and harmful-to-others if the selfish part of you won, because, you're meant to think, people don't <em>need</em> expensive clothing - although somebody who's spent a lot on expensive clothing clearly has some use for it or some part of themselves that desires it quite strongly.</p>
            <p>It is a parable calculated to set at odds two pieces of yourself (said the Watcher), and your flaw is not that you made the wrong choice between the two pieces, it was that you hammered one of those pieces down.&nbsp; Even though with a bit more thought, you could have at least <em>seen</em> the options for being that piece of yourself too, and not too expensively.</p>
            <p>And much more importantly (said the Watcher), you failed to understand and notice a kind of outside assault on your internal integrity, you did not notice how this parable was setting up two pieces of yourself at odds, so that you could not be both at once, and arranging for one of them to hammer down the other in a way that would leave it feeling small and injured and unable to speak in its own defense.</p>
            <p>"If I'd actually wanted you to twist yourselves up and burn yourselves out around this," said the Watcher, "I could have designed an adversarial lecture that would have driven everybody in this room halfway crazy - except for Keltham.&nbsp; He's not just immune because he's an agent with a slightly different utility function, he's immune because he instinctively doesn't switch off a kind of self-integrity that everyone else in this class needs to <em>learn </em>to not switch off so easily."</p>
            <p>It was a proud day for Keltham and a formative one, that dath ilan had acknowledged that the alien in their midst might have his uses.&nbsp; Like making it slightly easier to demonstrate a useful children's lesson for a class full of the smarter and more altruistic kids who would actually grow up to matter.&nbsp; But even so, there's a difference between growing up in a world that has&nbsp;<em>no</em> place for you and&nbsp;<em>no</em> use for you and respects&nbsp;<em>nothing</em> about you, versus a world which has&nbsp;<em>a</em> place for you and&nbsp;<em>some</em> use for you and&nbsp;<em>ever</em> really actually admits you can get some things right a little faster.</p>

            <p>The other thing he sees, from up here, is the point that his mind was put together the way it is, including the part where he's a kid who doesn't have to rush&nbsp;down the Path to stare at things like the truth that he couldn't have made a difference in dath ilan, and including the part where his contribution to diversity is pursuing the Way of being selfish and the things that selfish people can see faster than others, his <em>whole self</em> was put together, based on the assumption that he's in dath ilan, where, if Keltham is like that, terrible things <em>won't </em>happen to him.</p>
            <p>Or to other people.</p>
            <p>Golarion isn't dath ilan.</p>
            <p>His entire self and personality and emotional balance was assembled around beliefs that might not still be true.&nbsp; Probably aren't true.</p>
            <p>Keltham doesn't try to make any big decisions right now, he shouldn't, that's not what you <em>do</em> when you're on a new mind-affecting drug that is promising all kinds of startling revelations about yourself and what a foolish wrong person you've been.&nbsp; But it's something that he needs to think about after the spell wears off.</p>

            <p>Because people in Golarion get Owl's Wisdom cast on them once every six months, and they've never experienced what it's like to have gone your whole life without Owl's Wisdom?</p>
            <p>Somehow Keltham doesn't think that's it.</p>
            <p>It's a piece of - something&nbsp;<em>wrong,</em> something he doesn't know, something he believes that's false - about this entire situation, this entire world.&nbsp; People not quite behaving like obvious models say they should.</p>

            <p>No, that also feels like one of those weird excuses that Keltham was coming up with inside, to dismiss puzzle pieces.</p>
            <p>Keltham does feel - annoyed, on some level, <em>injured</em> even, that there weren't more warning signs.&nbsp; He thought he was getting a perception boost or maybe the equivalent of +0.1sd at some innate mental quality, not <em>this</em>. &nbsp;Or, well, no, he didn't have that much of a model, he didn't really think about it at all, he didn't ask, because he was still mentally living in a world where everything that can hit you really hard has a clearly attached warning sign that Civilization put there.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>There is - something dangerous, Keltham thinks, about having a sense of perspective, if too much of it comes on too quickly - there is seeing yourself, and the shadow of everything you've done, from the perspective where it is smaller and stupider - even the parts of you that provided all of your drive and your will and your sense of enjoyment in life, maybe not as ill things in themselves, but arranged stupidly - and with no better way to arrange them being obvious, as yet, because you were only wiser for something less than eight minutes. &nbsp;Of which you spent half that time practicing spellcasting.</p>
            <p>He is - not looking forwards as much, to his date with Carissa tonight, as he was an hour ago.&nbsp; Because he's looked back and reflected on himself, and on the whole headlong rush forwards that is a defining quality of Mad Investor Chaos.&nbsp; And now he is, in fact, thinking questioning thoughts about whether it is really in his own long-term self-interest - or <em>yes</em> the interest of a bunch of drowning children that&nbsp;<em>he does care about literally at all</em> even if he wants to be paid for saving them - for him to prioritize having sex with his research harem as one of his top goals on his second day in another universe.</p>
            <p>Should he actually be hesitant about that?&nbsp; It doesn't make sense, does it?&nbsp; He should not, in the face of this shock, have suddenly turned into a standard dath ilani.&nbsp; He is still himself, he should still have the parts of himself that are hyped for a date with Carissa.&nbsp; Being hit with a temporary spell <em>should not have changed those internal parts.</em>&nbsp; And if now his self is in a weird internal state of strife that prevents him from ever having any fun again - then he is pretty sure a Keeper would tell him that this is not the optimal way to get smashed and rearranged by a temporary reflectivity-increasing mind-affecting drug.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Ione is now trying to think very fast.</p>
            <p>So.&nbsp; They obviously haven't been told.&nbsp; Which, earlier, Ione thought in the back of her mind would happen as soon as the security wizard walked out after gouging her eye, because they'd tell her former classmates about the new security risk, because all of Cheliax would unite against her in hating her and hurting her as much as they could short of killing her.&nbsp; Apparently the part where, by default, security doesn't tell anyone anything, takes higher precedence.</p>
            <p>Also she is now&nbsp;<em>visibly </em><em>useful to the project</em> and that casts a different shade on the whole thing where - she knows how she wishes this would go, but to make security go along with it, she needs to have something to offer security, something to bargain with security, something that Nethys <em>wouldn't</em> require her to just hand over anyways -</p>
            <p>She also has to choose how to answer the expectant looks, now, even if it's silence she has to make it clearly deliberate -</p>
            <p>Ione thinks of something she can offer security, and picks her strategy to try with the other girls, because she doesn't want to spend the rest of her life with Keltham's other women being as cruel to her as won't kill her, whenever Keltham isn't looking.</p>
            <p>"So I'm not really sure," Ione says, using the glorious feeling of realizing her curse's real power to fuel a smile, "but I think Asmodeus cut a deal with Nethys, to go in on Keltham's project together, and I was the person here who was best suited to get the power from Nethys to summon temporary copies of books from other libraries plus whatever else it is I can do now.&nbsp; Didn't do it on purpose, just happened to me."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Elias Abarco pulls off his invisibility, looking greatly annoyed. He's mostly annoyed because Ione doesn't seem to care about anybody; they spent the last couple hours checking up on familial and nonfamilial relations they could murder or nearly murder to make a point, and her parents sold her to the school and she has an older brother who by all accounts hates her and she hates him back. This is healthy and encouraged in young wizards but it's damn inconvenient when one is irritated with Ione Sala and really wants to rip something she cares about to pieces before her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>He nods to Paxti, because she was right and should know it.</p>
            <p>"She's still Lawful Evil," he says curtly. "Paxti, you should hit the rest of them, for being slow in reporting. Do you know the spell -"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes."</p>
            <p>And he looks at Ione. Raises his eyebrows, slightly, nods even more slightly than that. And heads off to see why the damned bird is taking them so long, because it turns out that supervising a bunch of god-touched teenagers is the&nbsp;<em>worst.</em></p>

It's really cramping her style. But there is a halfling, or at least there might be, unless Asmodeus told Aspexia Rugatonn to do something different, which is not less terrifying, and so she doesn't want to particularly confront Ione, even though she has some good material for it, or even ask Ione for a book, which is what she'd do if there were slightly less at stake here, because it seems likely that Nethys's intervention here is part of what Otolmens is objecting to...</p>
            <p>Paxti's spell slaps her, harder than people usually bother with. Carissa wishes there were a way for Paxti to know that she's not just&nbsp;<em>affecting&nbsp;</em>being so absorbed in more important matters that she barely noticed, she actually is so absorbed in more important matters than she barely noticed, but there's not.</p>

            <p>Then Ione realizes she has to say, and it also works for her own benefit that she says it - "Note, though.&nbsp; Keltham thinks I'm a secret Nethys worshipper, and I've told him that probably most of you and most Chelish government officials wouldn't care, but that I wasn't sure.&nbsp; Security thinks that, once Keltham learns the spells to verify that I'm Nethys-touched, I can be a secret worshipper of Nethys here who confirms our stories to him.&nbsp; So don't treat me as anything except somebody with a weird book-fetching power, anywhere Keltham might see that.&nbsp; You are not supposed to know anything about me other than that, and even if you did, Keltham doesn't think that worshipping Nethys is something that'd get most people after me."</p>
            <p>It's a security advisory, it's clearly a correct security advisory, and if Ione gives it before anybody else does, it means Ione is somebody who sometimes says what the security advisories are.&nbsp; Which, obviously she absolutely will never abuse for anything Chelish security would not in fact like, she is a very good and cooperative oracle of Nethys, she is only securing her own safety among the lesser mortals who aren't security.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>There's a flare of hate in her then, now that she won't go to Hell for hating Asmodeus's servants.&nbsp; And with that hate, flashes of contempt, starting to arrange themselves around her sudden new identity.&nbsp; She is too scared, too shaking from being on fire for a minute, and too angry, not to think the thoughts that she is thinking now.</p>
            <p>You can make Asmodeans into high-level wizards, if you give them enough intelligence boosts, but you can't make them <em>think</em>.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>She's not particularly happy about having thought that, she doesn't actually <em>want</em> to insult the person in front of her if he's reading her mind, but the thought came to her anyways.</p>
            <p>The security wizard hasn't realized that this entire conversation has been predicted out by Nethys and Asmodeus, he isn't curious about the divine, he isn't keeping his eyes open and because of that he doesn't <em>see.</em>&nbsp; He's posturing about serving Asmodeus, and not realizing how this whole interaction they're having right now is something that Asmodeus no doubt had to work around and pay Nethys extra for in order to get a library oracle on His project.&nbsp; She hopes somebody in Hell has a very very long talk with him about that after he dies.</p>
            <p>Nethys has really gone to some lengths, in ways very visible to her, to make sure that Nethys can seriously threaten her and Chelish security <em>can't.</em></p>
            <p>She can't be <em>maledicted</em>, she can't be tortured for very long, if she's killed in the course of sincerely doing her duties that thought doesn't actually bother her at all if she gets to go to Nethys's afterlife and study magic forever instead of burning, and maybe Cheliax wouldn't dare kill her anyways because if she can't be <em>maledicted </em>somebody else might raise her and she'd talk all about Keltham.&nbsp; Ione Sala doesn't know what Nethys has set up against somebody cursing her stupider, but maybe it'll be too obvious to Keltham by then, or she can pray to Nethys for divine aid, or she could simply go to Keltham and tell him it's time to find a university who can Heal her better.&nbsp; Or maybe the higher-ups here are aware that cursing Nethys's oracle with stupidity <em>would</em> in fact constitute a serious slap in the face of a god, one who's very hard to keep out of things, on a site already subjected to extensive divine intervention.</p>
            <p>And she is too scared, too shaking, and too angry, not to think what she thinks then.</p>
            <p><em>That's not how compacts work, Asmodean.&nbsp; They're negotiated, not dictated.&nbsp; Nethys made very sure you wouldn't be able to escalate your threats against me to worse than what Nethys could do.&nbsp; Maybe you should call in a more experienced security officer who knows how to negotiate with non-Asmodeans you can't just maledict.&nbsp; Someone who understands what happens if you leave people scared of being set on fire and stupidified and your negotiating position does not, in fact, let you just keep escalating further until you send them to Hell.&nbsp; Non-Asmodeans stay on the lookout for ways to improve their bargaining positions, if they're scared and you haven't made a real deal with them, that's what happens.</em><em>&nbsp; I wasn't ambitious and I'm still not ambitious and I don't want really very much at all, if you negotiated terms with me I'd be very predictable and wouldn't even ask for very much, but if Asmodeus's representative wants Nethys's representative to be predictable, he needs to bargain for that and not just dictate.</em></p>
            <p>"I understand," Ione whispers out loud, meekly.&nbsp; He's either reading her thoughts like a halfway intelligent person or he's not; she'll see.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Sure, he'll speak more slowly. "When Nethys chose you, you could have come to us. You went to Keltham instead, to try to position yourself better for a deal. We granted you that you would continue attending class with your little friends. When you realized you had book-summoning powers, you could have come to us. You showed them to Keltham instead, to try to make it more inconvenient to replace you.&nbsp;<em>Then,&nbsp;</em>you proposed your deal: that we don't set the other students against you, that despite all your behavior in the past two days we treat you like an Asmodean student and encourage them in the same. I agreed to that too. And then I told you: <em>don't do that again</em>. You want to stay here, falsely admired by your peers, trusted by Keltham? Great. That has been agreed to. You have that. But if you push us any farther, we will take you out of the picture. The deal is that there will not be further deals.</p>
            <p>I don't know why you think Asmodeus bargained for Nethys's intervention here. The Grand High Priestess said nothing of that, when she came to read your mind, and she pays a great deal of attention to the question of how we accidentally make ourselves more costly for Asmodeus to steer. I think <em>Nethys</em> paid <em>Asmodeus</em> for whatever He's doing, and if it costs Nethys more, that <em>serves my god;&nbsp;</em>that's what I think. If you are a small obedient little girl who only wants a few small things, then, having attained those small things, I don't see why you'd hesitate to agree that you'll stop withholding things from us, stop presenting them to Keltham first to try to force a concession from us afterwards, and stop trying to condition your obedience on our further concessions. The game you have played twice today, you will not be able to play a third time, have I said it enough ways you comprehend it now?"</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Ione crawls over to where she left her clothes, and puts them back on, which is helpful for her to get some of her <em>sudden seething hatred</em> under control.&nbsp; Whatever else comes, she's never passing a Chelish loyalty screen again, and she may as well <em>think what she fucking wants now,</em> which really leaves quite a lot of thoughts backed up, and this is not the time for them.</p>
            <p>"Oracle of Nethys, Ione Sala, of the library's curse," she says, when her clothes are back on and she's sitting on the ground.&nbsp; "My god has either joined with your god, or been paid by Him to assist, on a project to bring another plane's knowledge to Cheliax.&nbsp; I require a bed either in the library, or in a room immediately adjacent to it.&nbsp; Aside from this, I am content with ordinary student-level sustenance and living conditions, which you will not worsen or withhold. &nbsp;You may either leave the other students here ignorant about my true nature, or tell them but then instruct them further not to mistreat me in any way whatsoever whether or not Keltham is watching.&nbsp; I understand there may be some restrictions on me.&nbsp; These restrictions need to mostly not prevent me from providing the services that Nethys intended me to offer this project.&nbsp; Whatever pay or equity is negotiated by Keltham for the participants in his project, will be allowed to actually accrue to me if it actually accrues to any single one of the other girls, and Cheliax can't take it from me including by unexpected fees or cost increases.&nbsp; You don't do anything clever to work around all that and make my life worse."</p>
            <p>"In exchange, I will cooperate with Chelish security, on the understanding that they treat me as a friendly representative of the allied god Nethys and not an Asmodean traitor who gets set on fire at somebody's whim.&nbsp; If we have disagreements, we work them out by negotiating as equals, not by a wizard who works for Cheliax showing up and gouging out my eye.&nbsp; If at some point you come up with something extra that you want from me, don't threaten me into it, offer me an interesting book.&nbsp; Or a magic item.&nbsp; Or if you want me to do almost anything, you can offer me my brother as my slave.&nbsp; Apart from that, I don't think I have any long-term goals besides pleasing Nethys enough to get a good Nethysian afterlife.&nbsp; I'm not impatient to reach ninth circle here instead of there."</p>
            <p>"If you manage to come up with a brilliant way to screw me on this deal, it's off, because I'm not an Asmodean and you're not a devil and this isn't a contract between two Asmodeans, it's a Nethysian-Asmodean deal.&nbsp; I'm Lawful and I'll keep my deals that are actually sensible deals for sensible people being sensible about them.&nbsp; I'm not an Asmodean any more, and I won't keep a contract that an Asmodean twisted around."</p>
            <p>"What makes Ione Sala predictable is when she thinks she can be safe if she stays predictable, which mostly means that she needs to be safe from Nethys's displeasure.&nbsp; The main thing that causes me to start looking for ways to improve my bargaining position with Cheliax, is if it looks to me like Cheliax might suddenly decide to do anything it wants to me at any time, especially things that might hinder my service to my god, unless my bargaining position is better.&nbsp; I will remember your claim that security would have worked with me if I'd come directly to them, and if you keep your side of things, I will try coming straight to you at least the next time I think I see something Nethys would want me to do.&nbsp; I hear your claim that my doing anything else unpredictable makes me too much of a liability and I will be killed no matter what after that, which I understand would make it hard to continue doing what Nethys wants me to do, and I understand Nethys would see that as a betrayal if I let it happen on purpose."</p>
            <p>"Our gods have an obvious common interest.&nbsp; We don't have to fight.&nbsp; I respect what Asmodeus has to offer this project.&nbsp; I hope Cheliax respects what Nethys has to offer."</p>
            <p>Ione finishes talking.&nbsp; She's trying to tense her entire body so it will stop&nbsp;<em>fucking trembling</em> and she knows she can't do this for much longer.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Halfling slave #958245 "Broom" has just seen a trembling human girl strip naked and then be set screaming on fire, which challenged his understanding of reality not in the slightest.&nbsp; After that, other things were said which challenged his understanding of reality significantly more.&nbsp; Did the girl just <em>win?</em>&nbsp; That is frankly not where he was expecting this to go.</p>
            <p><em>He</em> wouldn't set somebody on fire, if they were implicated in the possible end of the world.&nbsp; They might explode.&nbsp; Broom thought about trying to do something, but before he was done hesitating, the girl wasn't on fire any more, and then she was still talking disrespectfully to the powerful wizard who had just set her on fire.</p>
            <p>That does seem like the sort of person who might destroy the world, either by accident or on purpose?</p>
            <p>The conversation afterwards didn't make it seem like Ione Sala was planning to do that right away, but Broom is still feeling somewhat worried.&nbsp; He can imagine somebody carrying the sort of grudge, from being set on fire, where they decide to destroy the world about it.&nbsp; Especially if it's been happening to them regularly.&nbsp; <em>He</em> doesn't like being whipped and healed and whipped again.&nbsp; He <em>hated</em> that one time of his life where it was happening to him a lot.&nbsp; He just didn't have any options for doing anything about that, such as, for example, destroying the world.</p>
            <p>It is not&nbsp;entirely clear to Broom that Chelish security quite understands how to avoid making giant messes or how to clean them up, which, he supposes, makes sense of why some god named "Otolmens" would randomly grab Broom in the hallway and tell him to do it.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa ducks out from the crowd headed to dinner and goes to her room.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She's pretty sure she can fake her way through a date with Keltham, but she doesn't want to? She can come up with several justifications and she's not sure she buys any of them but one is that - when they tell him more, which they're going to have to, eventually, she'd like to tell him that she wasn't lying about this. Another one is that - she is trying to become bigger, more capable, more Evil, in the sense of&nbsp;<em>wanting Evil things for her own reasons&nbsp;</em>rather than the sense of being willing to do what it takes to survive, and so it seems like practice in the wrong direction, to go on a date while not wanting to. Another one is that at lunchtime she was so happy, full of ideas and satisfaction and cleverness and the conviction that there was something big and beautiful and perfect out there and Keltham was leading her towards it, and she wants&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>back.</p>
            <p>She doesn't, objectively speaking, have any reason to have lost it. She has basically earned confirmation that she was right, that there is something big and beautiful and perfect out there and that Keltham is leading her towards it, her and not anybody else, or at least her first. She didn't have the details nailed down but if you'd asked her to bet at lunchtime she wouldn't have bet she had the details right already. The main reason she now feels sick and small and scared isn't that she was wrong at lunchtime, it's that she realized since then that the path to big and beautiful and perfect requires skills she doesn't have and doesn't have long to acquire -&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- not a useful line of thought -</p>
            <p>- why does she want to go on a date with Keltham? Other than because there's a competition with that as a win condition and she's very competitive. Other than because if they have children they'll be very smart and Cheliax will objectively owe her lots of money for them whether or not it pays up. Other than because he's attractive, when he's trying to be that instead of trying to be a hundred other things.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Well, because there's something he is getting right. There is something no one in Cheliax is getting right except maybe Aspexia Rugatonn, and Aspexia Rugatonn can't teach it, even if she knows it, because if she could then everything would be different. There's a kind of way of living in the world that Keltham has, and they don't, and he saw immediately what a tragedy that was and wanted to teach it to&nbsp;<em>literally everyone&nbsp;</em>because - not because he's Good, he's not, he's a lot more Good than people here because his surroundings were but she can actually tell the difference and he's not -</p>
            <p>But you don't have to be Good to see a - mess, a Lawless mess if you'd like, and to wish that the beings in it stood taller, smarter, clarified and free, not as good as when they had no free will maybe but at least out of the local equilibrium where they have it <em>but are not competent to use it -</em></p>
            <p>He's also a teenager in way over his head and missing half the information he needs and depending which skills he grows in which order he's very possibly going to demand, when Cheliax comes clean with him, that everyone involved in the decision to deceive him be tortured to death, which would be reasonable, but -</p>
            <p>- she wants to sleep with Keltham because she wants everything he has, and she wants to see more pieces of him, and she wants it very, very badly. And she sits with that, and lets it fill her up, the longing to see the end of the path, the longing to&nbsp;<em>tell&nbsp;</em>him things and watch him&nbsp;<em>think&nbsp;</em>about them - to check the little Keltham she is building in her head against the real thing and see if she <em>gets</em> it yet -</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There. That's better. She goes to dinner.&nbsp;</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham can feel it like an echo of Owl's Wisdom, his explicit <em>awareness,</em> his inability not to look in that direction, towards his perception that everything he's heard about the afterlife has been <em>very</em> vague; and the explicit thought now completed, that this is probably not some random innocent mistake it's okay to ignore while he plunges ahead into everything else that's more tractable.</p>
            <p>He wishes he knew whether or not the truth about afterlives was being <em>deliberately </em><em>hidden</em> from him by the people here, or hidden by gods from living nongods in this afterlife-feeding economy, or if this is some safer issue where it'd work fine to try harder to pin people down on details at the expense of some social capital.</p>
            <p>He doesn't want to pin Carissa down on it, anyways.&nbsp; It's not a fun pre-date topic.</p>
            <p>"Sorry if I shouldn't ask, by the way, but I can't tell if your mention of meeting somebody more important than Contessa Lrilatha was a prompt to ask you about that if I was interested, or if it was deliberately vague to signal that I'm not supposed to ask."</p>

            <p>For the first time it occurs to Keltham to wonder if dath ilan used to <em>have</em> gods, and that's what the Great Screen is meant to protect, because if you know the info for gods, you might pray to them... it would take a huge effort to keep not just the phenomenon but&nbsp;<em>the physics behind it</em> out of all the textbooks, but that's the magnitude of effort dath ilan <em>put in</em> to the Great Screen.&nbsp; And if that's <em>not</em> what's going on, then there remains the unexplained question of why Keltham does not know any standard speculations about hypothetical superagents, that lots and lots of people could have <em>hypothesized,</em> hypotheses which pose a lot of interesting then-whats once you start looking in that direction.</p>

"So, Osirion. Osirion has a god-king, a pharaoh, they've had them since ancient times. The pharaoh of Osirion has hundreds of concubines. If he sees a hot girl in the street, I think he can just order her to become one of them. It's not particularly validating to be chosen by the pharaoh of Osirion, because it just means that you're either in the top couple hundred or that he was tired of the top couple hundred and wanted something new. I am absolutely not in the top percentile of hotness for women but if I went to Osirion I'd be a little worried about getting noticed, because I'm exotic, which is sometimes appealing in its own right.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa is, completely insanely, tempted to casually nod her head, even though that's not even at all - lots of countries do still have governments and don't enforce heresy laws and it's clearly one of those they're pretending at being -</p>
            <p>"I think you are imagining that this equilibrium is extremely fragile and that admitting we're in it is also disallowed? But actually it's extremely sticky. Overthrowing governments is really really hard and usually the thing that results when you overthrow a government is much worse. The consequences of overthrowing the Chelish government would be bad ones. So you don't have to - pretend the government is perfect - you just have to have a critical mass of people who don't believe that overthrowing it would produce something better, especially not since the Chelish government <em>is&nbsp;</em>possible to improve in normal ways by, like, suggesting improvements."</p>

            <p>Keltham manages not to yell this out loud, and having now finished internally yelling insults at reality, continues looking externally thoughtful, grateful for his recent practice with Eagle's Splendour.</p>
            <p>He is not going to say anything along those lines, however obvious, until he has picked up from books whether <em>Cheliax</em> has a pharaoh.&nbsp; Or rather, what kind of pharaoh it has.</p>
            <p>He is specifically not going to mention that, given a dath ilani training regimen, ten-year-olds are too smart to get stuck in traps like this; and would wait until the next solar eclipse or earthquake, at which point 10% of them would yell "NOW!", followed moments later by the other 90%, as is the classic strategy that <em>children spontaneously and independently invent</em> as soon as prompted by this scenario, so long as they have been previously taught about Schelling points.</p>
            <p>Has he at any point mentioned out loud dath ilan's annual Oops It's Time To Overthrow The Government Festival?&nbsp; He doesn't think so.</p>

            <p>"Anyway, sometimes it does go wrong and someone's power base isn't secure enough. Like in Tian Xia, the Lung Wa empire which had endured for centuries collapsed after Aroden's death because there was a massive associated natural disaster and a famine, and the empire collapsed, and everything is <em>much worse now</em>. I've met Tian adventurers and they tell stories about - ghost cities where everyone just left or died because trade routes were disrupted and food stopped coming, an entire country that made a pact with a kraken to be its slaves, other areas where the civil war&nbsp;<em>still hasn't ended&nbsp;</em>even though there are very few people left to kill each other. I am sure that the Emperor of Imperial Lung Wa did some things you'd abhorr but - it'd be monstrous, to overthrow him, to throw cities and civilizations and twenty million lives into the chasm of Chaos just to stop a couple dozen people from getting raped -"</p>

I just - it sounds like you're thinking about goverments as things that mostly maintain their power by making it too hard for people to correctly overthrow them, when my impression is that actually most people correctly don't want to overthrow them, and I can name six countries where I think that's not true so I don't think I'm just incapable of recognizing it when I see it, and it's not how I see Cheliax. Or Osirion, for that matter. Though I do think stealing all their women would be incredibly satisfying and we should do it."</p>

            <p>Gosh, Keltham hopes they weren't supposed to be coordinating some kind of immensely meaningful implied side conversation, while they were talking about this, because if so, Keltham has absolutely no idea what they both sidespoke, and that would be embarrassing.&nbsp; Well, not really his fault because of the enormous cultural gap and hypothetical Carissa should have known better, but still.</p>

            <p>Having a strong sexual desire to inflict pain, according to everything that dath ilan has taught Keltham about the world, would mean that any attempt to satisfy this desire would involve an unusually mentally resilient sex worker being paid a <em>lot</em> of money to put up with a sexual experience that she didn't like.&nbsp; If he got addicted, if his whole sexuality turned into that, the rest of his romantic life would suck really hard and probably never be truly satisfying again.&nbsp; That would have been the obvious prediction, going on the obvious-intuitive reasoning Keltham would have done from everything Civilization ever taught him.</p>
            <p>The thought that the world was full of other people who were the complements of that desire, who <em>wanted to be sexily hurt,</em> would just straightforwardly have never occurred to Keltham at all, if he'd spotted that desire in himself.</p>
