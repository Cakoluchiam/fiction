I imagine that's very different in dath ilan but wanting power except 'I want to study so much magic that lots of people come to my wizard tower to buy magic from me' is....you're almost definitely, if you actually pull it off, going to have - assassinated some people, ordered some children drowned so they won't be competition for your throne..." those are examples from a Taldane history she read this morning.&nbsp; "And I guess you could do that while still intending Good but the sorting doesn't just pay attention to your - self-serving narrative - and if you're killing lots of people to amass power it's almost definitely going to call you Evil. And you cannot become powerful without killing lots of people."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"Sure. Imagine a small village on a river somewhere, far north with poor farmland, maybe claimed by a distant King but he neither collects taxes nor enforces law so he doesn't feature in this story. In practice, the village is led by a priest of, I dunno, Pharasma, who is the only person in the village with magic; when villagers accuse each other of crimes, he hears them out and fines or punishes the one at fault. He collects a tax from them, for the church, of ten percent of their fields. Then someone's wayward son who went off to be an adventurer comes back, third-circle, capable of impressive things, rich with goods from out of town, and he is welcomed back by his family, until he drunkenly hits someone else in a quarrel over a girl, and kills them because he's an adventurer now and hits harder. And this is brought up before the old priest, and the priest says the adventurer must pay a fine and serve the family of the man he killed at harvest and planting time for ten years, in the place of the laborer he took from them, and the adventurer spits in his face, and then kills him too, and then says 'hey, from now on, I'm the one who will hear out accusations of crime in this village'."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"Leaving aside the decorative horror and focusing on the underlying game theory.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; Even assuming the villagers have no way of killing the adventurer even by cooperatively sacrificing themselves - there's a saying in dath ilan 'Anyone can kill anyone but they probably shouldn't' and maybe that's just not true here, in which case fine - and even assuming they don't all go 'fuck this guy's unfair division of gains from trade, let's head to the afterlife and leave him with an empty village' - then, if nothing exists in the world outside this village, if there are no hidden players not on the gameboard, then it would seem to be in this person's best interests not to let anyone else kill anybody and run the whole village for his own profit, until somebody else comes along who's stronger and kills him.&nbsp; Which is the case I described before."</p>
            <p>"I agree that, assuming the villagers let the adventurer get away with that and don't just leave for the afterlife, if one is a fourth-circle cleric, one could perhaps come in and kill the adventurer and get a little sad bit of power.&nbsp; It doesn't - seem like something that <em>scales</em>.&nbsp; The reason it works is that it's isomorphic to a two-player game where one player has all power, and the other player has none but goes along with an unfair division of gains instead of leaving for the afterlife."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>So.</p>
            <p>Their world has people who are more smart or less smart, just like his world.</p>
            <p>Lots of smarter people, however, are out to exploit less smarted people using adversarially selected arguments.</p>
            <p>So the less smarted people have to freeze in place and only believe what they were told by - their parents, Keltham guesses, because even if somebody wandering into the village&nbsp;<em>looks</em> as dumb as you, they could be a smart person faking that.</p>
            <p>Nobody has any Law-inspired concept of validity, or which arguments are admissible or inadmissible, or how to go about constructing a narrower class of arguments that could still contain important stuff while being harder for smarter adversaries to exploit.&nbsp; Their books are endless strings of non-sequiturs and impossible leaps and emotion-invocations, and when your contest of ideas is on that level, there is nothing you can do to stop a clever adversary from doing a search that Goodharts through any flaws or loopholes in the resistance of a dumber argument-considerer.</p>
            <p>...or maybe dath ilan would also be like this, Law or no Law, if not for the Keepers and the fact that the Keepers are, so far as Keltham knows, Good.&nbsp; Just given what's publicly known about talk-control, most dath ilani can little more resist a high-ranked Keeper going all-out on exploiting their own flaws, than a villager of this world could resist the arguments of a wizard, if the villager was foolish enough to hear out a stranger.</p>
            <p>But - what is he supposed to&nbsp;<em>do</em> about that, if that's the case?&nbsp; Even if he can mass-manufacture intelligence headbands they won't change the&nbsp;<em>relative intelligence...</em> well, no, because currently the smartest people&nbsp;<em>get intelligence headbands</em> and the less smart people&nbsp;<em>don't</em> so at the very minimum fixing&nbsp;<em>that</em> would have to shift the equilibrium relative to what it is now...</p>
            <p>"Thanks for my evening update on how awful Golarion is," Keltham says out loud, and not without a certain irony.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Likewise mortal but longer-lived things, a hair closer to ideal agency though still far from it, now battle.</p>
            <p>Their objective: to bring enough pressure to bear on 'Zon-Kuthon outside the vault' that He must choose between being inside that vault and significantly ceasing to be.&nbsp; Maybe not ceasing entirely, but becoming perhaps a fallen being, a mere demigod.&nbsp; He must choose between going into the vault, and that.</p>
            <p>The assembled gods cannot reasonably endeavor to kill all of Zon-Kuthon, if He chooses the latter path.&nbsp; Gods encrypt their energies, arrange their potentials in lattices and arrays to which only they have keys.&nbsp; Like a box full of bouncing classical gas atoms that can be made to all end up on the box's left side, in apparent defiance of thermodynamics and ready to yield up their heat as a pressure, <em>if</em> you know the secret for how those atoms were originally set in motion to be able to end up like that with the right tweak.&nbsp; Anybody who doesn't know the secret just sees a box full of a useless uniform gas.</p>
            <p>In likewise way, a being under such assault as Zon-Kuthon may scatter little shards of Himself here and there, too small and subtle for now to be noticed, but destined to collide and gather up at some future time - a time when His adversaries are paying less attention, no longer spending all Their own power and watchfulness to launch a coordinated assault on Him blanketing Golarion and the other planes where He extends.</p>
            <p>Among the greatest of adventurers who yet do not quite understand, it is whispered that only by killing a great Power within Their own home plane is it possible to destroy that Power permanently; and also that a Power within its home plane is nearly invincible.</p>
            <p>These whispers are not quite accurate.&nbsp; The key concept rather - and from mortals it is hidden - is that gods face a tradeoff between <em>weakness </em>and <em>vulnerability.&nbsp; </em>They can gather themselves up and become stronger, but only at the risk of their own true destruction.&nbsp; Any problem which requires you to become unified and powerful and <em>localized</em>, and therefore <em>vulnerable</em> to any still greater force, is a challenge you should face on your own home ground if you possibly can.&nbsp; On the very rare occasions when Powers are truly slain, therefore, they tend to fall within their home planes, after ascending to terrifying heights within it.</p>
            <p>The assembled gods, then, know that they can only force so much of Zon-Kuthon into the vault prepared for Him.&nbsp; As He could survive as a demigod outside it, He can also go mostly into the vault but leave a demigod's worth of Himself outside.&nbsp; That demigod's worth of power will not be able to free Rovagug, though; and that is all the assembled gods are aiming for.</p>
            <p>Most of them, that is.</p>

            <p>Nethys sees <em>every </em>part of Zon-Kuthon. &nbsp;Nethys knows where <em>every </em>part of Zon-Kuthon is trying to hide.</p>
            <p>Nethys provides those coordinates to Someone Else.</p>
            <p>That's the sort of divine backstab that, if found out, would get every large or obvious remaining piece of Nethys assaulted by more Golarion gods than are currently assaulting Zon-Kuthon.</p>
            <p>The only reason the gods are not <em>currently</em> that scared of Nethys is because it has not, up until now, seemed like Nethys is particularly <em>likely </em>to do that sort of thing - to tattle on gods' secrets to one another, to start wars between Them in which Nethys will pick sides and provide aid, weakening Them until all the gods that Nethys doesn't like, or maybe all the other gods period, have been killed.</p>
            <p>It would not be in Nethys's seeming interests to start down that path, because you can't conceal that sort of thing forever.</p>
            <p>But that logic is not unassailable, and other gods will be watching for early signs.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa finds it hard to think around Keltham.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Not in a stupid romantic way, she doesn't think, though she's aware it's the obvious interpretation. She thinks it's more that - all of her mind has to be pointed at him. She has to be paying attention to the surroundings, the conversation, the connected distant-implications, the opportunities for flirtation, she has to be directing most of her mind at the deception surrounding Keltham and also impress him with the quality of conversation she can generate with the part of her mind that's on him.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As a result, the sober Carissa diagnosis of what she's like around Keltham is that she's fundamentally reactive. She follows trains of thought of his, she answers his questions. She teases him. She ventures a bit of promising theology, occasionally, if she's feeling bold. But she cannot construct an overarching plan. Which is fine, not that debilitating, it just means she needs one in advance, but tonight has been kind of eventful and the plan she had before they went to practice Keltham's cleric spells is a bit outdated.&nbsp;<br><br>Kissing Keltham leaves more space to think than talking to him does, so she persists in it even once she would ordinarily declare that quite enough kissing.</p>
            <p><br>She wants to convince him to fuck her. She's pretty sure that this is an important step in building intimacy. It involves him trusting her with something, and her demonstrating that trust warranted, and in her not-really-very-professional-judgment it's the best sex act for his kinks, it's about power without obliging him to do a lot of deliberate and constructed&nbsp;<em>making&nbsp;</em>it about power which he's still learning how to do.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She wants to gently introduce, in a testing the waters kind of way, the ideas that 1) some girls are into out-there stuff, Carissa's about&nbsp;<em>average&nbsp;</em>and that means half of girls are kinkier than her, see where that line of thought takes him, 2) power is more interesting when it's not a game nobles play for fun, isn't it and 3) the thing that makes this right is that Keltham wants it and can get it.</p>
            <p>The third one seems hard. She spent a fair share of her beauty appointment playing it in her head with imaginary Keltham.&nbsp;<br><br>"You want it and can get it. <em>That'</em>s what matters, that's why it's all right, it's all right for you to have things, assuming you can get them without breaking the Law."<br><br>Imaginary Keltham: "Right, but the reason the Law doesn't prohibit this is that you also want it. Otherwise it would. If you try to propose a Law that says it doesn't matter what you want then all the people where the Law agrees it doesn't matter what they want would simply overthrow the Law and replace it with a Law who didn't say that, and even if they wouldn't, they could in principle, so the Law can't say that."</p>
            <p>"You want it and can get it. Does it - does it feel like there's something important there? Something that dath ilan would - be missing, if they treated that as sort of a sideshow that gets to rise to relevance only if every other feature of the situation has lined up just right?"<br><br>Imaginary Keltham: Well, it's relevant no matter what, it's just that sometimes the way in which it's relevant is that society should try to have fewer people like me in it, or that it needs to put more emphasis on people not doing things just because they want to.&nbsp;<br><br>"You want it and can get it. That's -&nbsp;<em>itself&nbsp;</em>appealing about you. Maybe that's a very circuitous fetish but it feels very fundamental, to me. The trait that matters in the world is being able to get things you want, and the most romantic situation is being wanted. And that means there's inherently nothing sexier than someone who wants you and can get what he wants."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That one feels promising but like it achieves its promisingness by running askew and probably being heresy, again. She still thinks it's a line of argument worth attempting. Maybe you can get someone to 'being willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want is sexy' and then from there to 'being willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want is okay'.&nbsp; She still tries to imagine objections imaginary Keltham might have, but Imaginary Keltham mostly says things like 'math you've never heard of proves that doesn't work', which is a sign she needs to take this problem to Actual Keltham.</p>
            <p>Once she has a plan. Which she doesn't, yet, so. More kissing.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>She likes Keltham. Her thoughts are probably lingering on this because of how she's presently kissing him but it's true, and no doubt there's been at least one agonized meeting over it though somehow no one has reprimanded her, maybe because they know that she really really really does not want to be a statue and even if all the other pillars of her motivational structure grew Keltham-rot inside them - and they haven't - she will still not betray them. She's heard it said - dismissively - that the characteristic female fantasy is that there is a powerful man who could hurt you, but he doesn't. Maybe that's all that it is. But right now, the way that it is is that she likes Keltham, and when he has her in his arms, all her plans maintain only the most tenuous of connections to her, bobbing up and down in the periphery of her mind like a sailor overboard on the high seas, visible for a long time despite being almost immediately beyond rescue.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>....and maybe she should troubleshoot that.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>What are her objectives. First, to get Keltham to feel attached to her. Second, to comprehend him fully in order to build the Evil version of dath ilani thought. Third, stretch goal, seduce him to Evil.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The third one seems tricky right now. That's okay. Carissa's going to be forgiving of herself about that. Other people, too, agree that it seems hard. Keltham is still grappling with ideas like that smarter people might take advantage of less smart ones; this part of the operation is in exploratory mode, right now, and that's all right.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The second one...also seems tricky right now, though more necessary than ever.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Whenever Carissa's around Keltham she gets confused about the nature of Evil. It's because the version she gave him just - fits better into a pathetic human mind? In hindsight it's obvious that trying to destroy the world might seem Good, that Rovagug cultists certainly would be, principled believers that the world should be devoured at their own expense. And the observable fact about the world that almost everyone ends up Evil makes more sense if Evil is about selfishness or lack of altruism than it does with the understanding that Evil is - well, Abrogail Thrune. Carissa is pretty sure this thought will end up in a transcript for Abrogail Thrune tomorrow so hi, Abrogail Thrune, please don't turn me into a statue, Abrogail Thrune, I am suffering in your service very diligently, Abrogail Thrune, but most people are not Abrogail Thrune. Most people are not even weak pale shadows of Abrogail Throne. Tyranny, slavery, pride, contracts - most people kind of just bumble along being weak and pathetic and Carissa is confused about 1) how any of them make Law and 2) how any of them make Evil. She's not worried about herself, personally. She's definitely making progress on Law and she thinks she's made some progress on being genuinely Evil the last two days. She's taking to authority nicely and has lit people on fire when they deserved it and offering to destroy Asmodia's soul in a dark sorcerous rite, if it's not heretical to contemplate, was kind of fun, though also Carissa wants everyone to go to Hell and not get destroyed in sorcerous rites.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(Is that Good? If she wants it in a way that's not about what Asmodeus wants, that's about the sheer horror of their annihilation - it's at the very least the product of a broken mind misunderstanding doctrine. And yet.)</p>
            <p>It hadn't occurred to Asmodia what they had to be trying to do here. But they are going to have to do it, or the mountains of spellsilver will go to everyone and Cheliax won't be uniquely advantaged - might be disadvantaged, even, if their current systems for promoting enough Law and Evil to get their children clear of Abaddon and into Hell stop working on a smarter generation of children - reformulate that to be less pathetic and broken, even if it means it fits less well into her present mind, she doesn't wish to err when she's trying to do strategic planning even if the errors are convenient otherwise, even if she suspects Asmodeus chose her partially for her heresies - Cheliax's current systems get souls to Asmodeus, who wants them; Asmodeus has extended this project resources on the assumption it can get him more souls, or more useful ones, and that's why it ought to do that.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Asmodia is presumably being tortured right now and Carissa hopes she's not useless when she gets back. Maybe it'll be good for her motivation.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The first goal, on the other hand, is going great. Maillol says the things she'd done shouldn't have worked, but they did, and Keltham likes her, and if she only had to accomplish the first goal she'd practically have accomplished it already and she could just keep him interested and roll around on a giant mountain of spellsilver.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Maybe.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Keltham hasn't really hurt Carissa. In a sense, no one has ever really hurt Carissa; she talks a good game but she was careful, in her old life, about which powerful adventurers who could kill her if they were so inclined she climbed up into a Rope Trick with; she mostly went for girls, because whatever Maillol says they are less inclined to hurt you on average though obviously Abrogail Thrune, hi Abrogail Thrune, is entitled to do exactly as she pleases with Carissa including turning her into a statue though Carissa really really hopes that she won't do that because Carissa wants to go to Hell and will make herself very useful to Abrogail Thrune there. If she gets there. Subordinate devils are worth having! Much more useful than statues!</p>
            <p>...anyway Keltham can bite her, and claw at her, but he hasn't for example even looked at the pokers in the fireplace, and he hasn't even asked for tips on the most efficient ways to hurt people without causing damage, and unless you count the cursed Bag of Holding as a sexual experience and plausibly Carissa should she hasn't, actually, been tortured in a sex way, and shouldn't have high confidence in how gracefully she'll handle it except within the bounds of how well she handles it in other contexts. It seems possible she'll like Keltham less once she's taught him how and why to really hurt her. It's possible that whatever switch will flip in her head and he'll be terrifying instead of intriguing, and then everything will just suck.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Which would be good practice for Hell, if so.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>....Carissa thinks that somehow all this thinking is actually making her worse at her job and she should abandon it and go back to not thinking, which was working fine, kind of.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>"It can be different for a woman pestering a man for sex, but only to the extent she has extremely reliable information - which basically means, information directly from him - that he's highly conformant to the masculine 'gendertrope' and that sub-'gendertrope' in particular.&nbsp; I would have provided you with that information just now, when I told you that I was enjoying being asked and saying no."</p>
            <p>(Keltham is just using Baseline 'gendertrope' as a loanword into Taldane, at this point, since the corresponding concept in Taldane simply doesn't exist.)</p>
            <p>"Civilization is all very - structures to make sure that people end up having the power to protect themselves in their sexual relationships, and the realistic ability to decide for themselves without that taking a lot of mental work, and common knowledge that everyone has in fact been trained to protect themselves that way and passed some tests about it, all so that people can be given full <em>responsibility </em>to decide for themselves."</p>
            <p>"So long as you're following those rules, in a world where you know everybody else follows those rules, it means you don't have to worry about them on their behalf, or try to protect them <em>more </em>than they protect themselves, or doubt them when they say yes."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham considers explaining the concept of an ero-LARP, much more famous novels deconstructing those ero-LARPs, and ero-LARPs based on novels deconstructing ero-LARPs.</p>
            <p>He considers trying to explain how quantum mechanics is known from experiment and how it in turn implies the many worlds, and what the nature of amplitudes led Civilization to realize about realityfluid, and how all those many worlds must be embedded into a still larger Reality in which the quantum multiverse itself is multiply instantiated.&nbsp; And how, having survived an airplane crash, there is a single obvious wild thought about what must have happened to him, that ending in almost all places he continued on within a remaining and improbable one.&nbsp; If he was a Keeper, probably, Keltham would already know it; for it seems like the sort of thing that must be deducible from first principles if it is true at all, and also, an obvious massive infohazard in ways that Keltham may not have begun to conceive.&nbsp; He's not sure exactly <em>why </em>it will be massively infohazardous <em>but it obviously will be.</em></p>
            <p>And now the place where he finds himself, has people who aren't any plausible equilibrium of selection pressures, but happen to exactly fit the complementary shape of his own unsatisfied and unsatisfiable sexuality; and there's a research group full of girls roughly his age, with himself the sole male among them, and an explicit rationalization for why they all want his seed; and they all have economicmagic and 3-5 of them have fascinating backstories that even Golarion would find surprising; while Nidal invades Cheliax targeting him personally and the godtreaties break down, thereby forcing him to relocate to a new bedroom decorated in doompunk with chains attached to the bed.</p>
            <p>What happens if you perform an evidential update from that, and then predict the future?</p>
            <p>He considers explaining this to somebody who is not going to know, at least until tomorrow, maybe not even for two whole more days, what an evidential update is.</p>
            <p>"Carissa," he says, truly apologetically, "you have not, in fact, ever heard me try to explain any topic that Civilization would consider at all complicated; and this, is a little complicated.&nbsp; I know which concept I'd explain first in the sequence of the explanation, and I was going to do that concept tomorrow, but that sequence goes on for a while."</p>

"Nothing like that. There's a place in Garund where there's a wasteland for hundreds of miles because two ninth-circle wizards fought there, but it isn't actually dangerous to travel through, it's just that magic behaves weirdly and plants mostly don't grow. There's opening something like the Worldwound but Nidal and Cheliax are both Lawful and committed to not doing that, and anyway it's very very difficult and still doesn't just straightforwardly scale up.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- I would know, I think, if there were something that a reasonable number of people knew about or that had ever in history been used, because people at the Worldwound pay a lot of attention to our options however speculative for closing it. There could of course be secret things.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>....and one time some people crashed a moon into the planet, so, uh, there's that. I guess."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Waking up from dying is not exactly like waking up from falling asleep.&nbsp; Your memory isn't of a muzzy period that trails off and blurs into notness as you fall half asleep and then all asleep.&nbsp; Dying is abrupt, at least if you do it the way Asmodia did - hearing a Security alert to cast resistances she doesn't have, no useful spells prepared at all, and then being swarmed by shadows moments after she'd reached her self-defense dagger.&nbsp; It's very clear where your last life's memory ends.</p>
            <p>Coming out of it is something like being drowning in the water and then clawing yourself onto shore and coughing out that water, and then, having just finished doing that.&nbsp; Only without the whole part where you almost drowned, made it to shore, and coughed out that water, just the part where you'd finished.</p>
            <p>Asmodia wakes up.</p>
            <p>It doesn't take her very long at all to figure out why she's naked in a black stone room in front of a contract devil she met very recently.</p>
            <p>Her internal screaming is very very very loud, but it's all internal, of course.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham takes a deep breath.</p>
            <p>"So, you've now ever been partially exposed to snippets from the basics of the basics of childhood training for dath ilani, you don't have zero idea of how we see reality.&nbsp; We're used to knowing things <em>legibly.</em>&nbsp; Including places where Golarion might have the idea that it's important for people to obscure things, because you've built a weird not-quite-Lawful thing which requires illegibility to work."</p>
            <p>"Like - bargaining, the way you first described how somebody would do that for my shirt.&nbsp; You can imagine a non-dath-ilani with a shirt thinking 'oh no, I must conceal that the true value of my shirt to me is just a million gold pieces, if they think it's really five million I can get a higher price, if they know it's one million they can just give me an ultimatum to take one million one hundred thousand take it or leave it.&nbsp; A dath ilani wouldn't be scared of things becoming legible, because they have more Lawful approaches that don't disadvantage them in the presence of that legibility; they know the right thing to do is refuse unfair but mutually beneficial trades with very high probability.&nbsp; The real value they put on their shirt isn't a secret for them the way it's a secret for somebody bargaining the usual way for Golarion."</p>
            <p>"I mean, if they were playing by Golarion's rules, they might still try to make the other person think it was five million if that was the game.&nbsp; If it wasn't anything serious like negotiations with Cheliax, I could see myself playing the bargaining game the illegible way if that saved me time explaining things, I'd try to have fun with it even, though I doubt I'd be very good at it on the first try. &nbsp;But I'd have a legible game to fall back on if the illegible game blows up or isn't going my way."</p>
            <p>"If you're used to that being the way things are, trying to play an illegible game with no known legible Law underlying it feels like walking on wet ice... you don't have a lot of ice.&nbsp; Feels unstable, like you're about to put your foot down wrong and fall over, any second.&nbsp; As kids they train us to keep going anyways and parse the universe as we run through it, but that doesn't make illegibility feel safe."</p>
            <p>"There's places even so where Civilization would - give somebody a hug and tell them it was okay to not be totally legible right away.&nbsp; A mother who just gave birth to a child doesn't need to immediately put a value in unskilled-labor-hours on her baby's life, how much she'd pay to avert a 0.1% chance of various bad things happening, any of that.&nbsp; Anybody who burst in and started quizzing her about that would be ejected from the maternity hospital and probably from most of the cities in Civilization."</p>
            <p>"But when Civilization gives someone a hug and tells them it's okay not to make up numbers today, what that relies on,&nbsp;<em>very crucially,</em> is the expectation that the numbers the mom isn't making up and doesn't know to herself <em>are roughly correct numbers</em> in the sense of leading to <em>roughly the same decisions </em>as <em>better numbers would</em>.&nbsp; The reason we give a hug of it's-okay-not-to-be-legible-today to the mom who just gave birth is that, if she did make up numbers about the value of her baby's life to her, they'd be more like four million labor-hours than <em>four </em>labor hours.&nbsp; She's not going to frantically drop her baby in order to save a water-glass from falling and breaking.&nbsp; If you expected her to get decisions like that&nbsp;<em>wrong</em> you'd tell her to make up legible numbers&nbsp;<em>immediately</em> and run them past somebody else."</p>
            <p>"Someone tells me that she's given herself to me, to do with as I want, and if I'd grown up in Golarion we'd probably both be fine from there.&nbsp; But in reality, I'm pretty sure there would be&nbsp;<em>some</em> things I could do that were&nbsp;<em>really not what you had in mind,</em> like, like taking that sharp thing... +3 vicious nasty bigsword, and killing you with it, and then after you're brought back I just kill you again and tell Cheliax not to bring you back that time.&nbsp; That is probably <em>really not what you had in mind,</em> and just to be very clear, it is not what I had in mind either.&nbsp; And you can't spell out things like that for me, my model predicts you replying, because then it's you telling me what I can't do, and contrary to the nature of this thing the way it needs to be.&nbsp; In this case there's no problem, right, because it so happens that I don't want to do that to you, my brain is generating the correct answer despite it being illegal to tell me an underlying Law.&nbsp; But that also means I'm playing an illegible game that has no known legible game behind it, and I feel like I'm walking around on wet ice every time I try to think about moving forward with it, because I did not grow up in Golarion, and I am not confident that the numbers I'm not making up are roughly correct ones."</p>
            <p>"Done."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa finds herself noticing that she shouldn't lie about how her sexuality works because she has no idea what the Second Law of inferring peoples' sexualities does. She assumed Keltham noticed she was faking earlier through training she could learn to subvert but if he's using the Second Law, then the only way out is truth, not necessarily her truth but real truth, the only thing that will have the right truth-properties on the Shadow Plane Of - what did he call them - tropes.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"....part of Chelish dignity is definitely that you only offer deals if you genuinely mean them, that you're not relying on any - altruism or mercy of the other person that was not specified up front. In practice, if you like the sort of things I like, that - kind of means you have to be awfully invincible? Or - mostly I slept with people at the Worldwound where the treaty proscribed them killing or permanently disabling or kidnapping me, and that was enough.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I don't think the core thing that is important to me is being invincible. I think the core thing that is important to me is - not being foolish, and if I assumed there was some safety where there wasn't, then that was foolish,&nbsp;<em>especially&nbsp;</em>across a&nbsp;<em>species gap,&nbsp;</em>so I had to assume there might be none, and it's very satisfying, to be able to assume that.... and another part of it is that something very important to me is being safe. I think part of why I like being hit is that - one way of being safe, right, is to never have bad things happen to you, but another is to never have bad things be bad for you, to transmute them all through arousal and the admiration of others and sheer determination into something that you're good at, and prized for. I feel safer when someone is hitting me than I ever feel otherwise, because I know I can handle something I didn't previously know I could. You could drive a sword through me, no one would stop you, but I'm safe even if you do, so I'm not scared....I don't know if I'm making sense." She's not lying, though.</p>

            <p>His last memories say that somebody hit him with a Suffocation spell, a caster powerful enough that Maillol went unconscious almost immediately, and unconscious is not a good place to be in the middle of a Nidal assault even if the spell doesn't just kill you.&nbsp; Maillol didn't particularly expect to survive, to be clear, and burned all his negative channelings almost immediately; he wasn't expecting combat that day and hadn't requested spells accordingly.</p>
            <p>Maillol lives and pulls himself together, fast enough you might not notice it, and requests a situation update.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"Our Lord is at war with Zon-Kuthon," the briefing begins, "and Cheliax is at war with Nidal. Keltham is alive. Sevar is alive and has project command, though she delegated most project decisions to you anticipating your immediate return. Otolmens' oracle is alive. Keltham, Sevar, and Otolmens' oracle have been relocated to the palace on Her Majesty's orders; Sevar is presently chained up in Keltham's bed, having had a conversation with him in which she told him that what he desires is a romantic relationship in which she belongs to him, he worried she did not mean he could murder her, she insisted she did mean that, and he decided to trust her and try doing whatever he wants, which seems to be cuddling. Project casualties are in your briefing notes, they're in line for resurrection; we're seeing high casualties on the border, so those resurrections may be slow at their present prioritization.</p>
            <p>Pilar, the oracle of Cayden Cailean, somehow accompanied Keltham to his spell testing and out of the villa for the summons, and then took a sword for him; she's higher priority for resurrection because we're both worried we might lose her - she's in Elysium - and because we need to ask her what the fuck happened. Asmodia is also dead, confirmed in Hell, lower priority; Ione is not conscious and may not, given the vision was likely from Nethys, recover consciousness. The villa has just been determined clear of hostiles and traps and not yet evaluated for Kuthite magic items for divination or espionage. Keltham is suspicious about the destruction of his notes, which happened when the Kuthites swarmed the villa, and about the fact that the invasion was obviously timed to his stepping outside the villa and yet the invaders didn't seem to immediately know where he was. We have no explanation for this. He's requested we ensure there are no secret Kuthites on staff; we're pretty damn sure, obviously, but if there's anyone who could plausibly have evaded recent evaluation, haul them in. He's also suspicious that Security didn't teleport him out; we determined that staff member used his Teleports earlier in the day fetching requisitions from a supply depot in Corentyn, and that despite this he was selected to accompany Keltham out of the villa because he passed muster to Detect Anxieties and Detect Desires when most didn't, but if anything about that seems odd to you, we can raise his priority for resurrection as well, or if he refuses it contact his owner in Hell."</p>

            <p>Maillol wants to believe that this is literally <em>the worst</em> that a project disaster can possibly, possibly get.</p>
            <p>He is afraid that it is not.</p>
            <p>"Have we considered the possibility that this project is, in fact, cursed directly by Pharasma Herself with all of Her malice, and should be shut down entirely before we find out what happens to it tomorrow," says Maillol.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>In the depths of the center of the Palace in Egorian, there is a chamber that sees unfortunately frequent use.&nbsp; The queen sits on a stepped dais high enough that her own head will not be below that of the crouching form of Gorthoklek the pit fiend, which, even with Gorthoklek crouching, requires quite the high dais.&nbsp; Across from Gorthoklek also stands Contessa Lrilatha in full and deadly panoply.</p>
            <p>Before the dais stands one other.</p>
            <p>The most important purpose of this chamber is to, when it becomes necessary, hold an intervention.</p>
            <p>"You," Abrogail Thrune declares coldy, imperiously, a voice like a twisting dagger, "are a greater disappointment to me than perhaps any other being or happening in my life."</p>
            <p>"The feeling is mutual," says one of the three entities in Cheliax who would dare say such a thing.</p>
            <p>"I can remember as though it were yesterday, my excitement when I learned that Asmodeus had sent me my own personal erinyes to tempt me and corrupt me.&nbsp; What poisonous words does she now whisper in my ears?&nbsp; Restrain my cruelty.&nbsp; Restrain my lust.&nbsp; I must control my desires and not let my desires control me.&nbsp; I have been assigned my own personal black-winged monk of Irori."</p>
            <p>"Irori is Lawful Neutral," observes the same entity who spoke before, Contessa Lrilatha.&nbsp; "Asmodeus is Lawful Evil.&nbsp; Need I spell out in greater detail what the two have in common?&nbsp; Imagine my own disappointment when, hoping I had been assigned an eager pupil to corrupt further, I found myself instead tasked to restrain an incipient drow queen."</p>
            <p>"Drow queen.&nbsp; What a tempting thought.&nbsp; They, one hears, are allowed to have fun."</p>
            <p>Aspexia Rugatonn speaks then, weary, dry, from where she stands before the dais, facing down the Queen with the other two sensible beings in Cheliax.&nbsp; "You are allowed to have fun.&nbsp; You are allowed to have other fun.&nbsp; Find different fun."</p>
            <p>"I don't want different fun.&nbsp; I want to turn Sevar into a statue.&nbsp; I really, really want to turn Sevar into a statue."</p>
            <p>"I really, really want to dissolve you in acid but you don't hear me being a whinecomplainbitch* about it."&nbsp; (This word of Infernal now appears as a loanword in the Chelish dialect of Taldane.)</p>
            <p>"I want to petrify her slowly, so that she can feel it happening, and scream with all of her heart and all of her soul while it's happening, and release all of that terror, and tension, and everything inside her, and I want to kiss her gently while she's turning to stone and screaming. &nbsp;She's just so <em>scared</em>, and I so rarely meet anyone who's that scared... well, anyone interesting to me who's that scared of me personally doing something that it would interest me to do to them."</p>
            <p>Even hunched over, with its wings folded, the black figure is taller than a man standing on another man's shoulders. &nbsp;"I expect that our Lord would be most extremely displeased," rumbles Gorthoklek.</p>
            <p>"I would, of course, unpetrify her immediately afterwards; and swear then never to do that to her in truth, unless she had betrayed the House of Thrune knowingly, deliberately, and unambiguously."</p>
            <p>Gorthoklek and Contessa Lrilatha both pass their Bluff checks against the queen; Aspexia Rugatonn, who is not specialized in Splendour in quite the same way, does not.&nbsp; The brief break in the room's atmosphere is therefore, however finely, noticeable.</p>
            <p>"What," says Abrogail.&nbsp; "Did you actually believe that I would actually bury her?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; <em>Really?</em>&nbsp; After having known me this long, you still think I would do that?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," say three of the four most powerful beings in Cheliax in unison.</p>
            <p>"Perhaps I would if Asmodeus had not singled her out and if she were not performing vital work for Cheliax.&nbsp; But, that being so, do you truly believe I would affront Asmodeus's purpose and interests so, when I could have most of the fun I wanted without the cost to Hell?&nbsp; You should know, given the consequences to me, and how those have not yet been invoked, that I have never once betrayed Asmodeus in the depths of my own heart."</p>
            <p>"The trouble is what the depths of your own heart seem to define as a betrayal of Asmodeus," rumbles Gorthoklek.&nbsp; "The depths of your own heart seem astonishingly permissive about it."</p>
            <p>"Oh?&nbsp; How misfortunate.&nbsp; The devil negotiating my pact on behalf of Asmodeus should have defined that term more carefully."</p>
            <p>Mortal humans being what they are, one would have expected this clause of the contract to come into force within days of the pact being signed and possibly the first minute.&nbsp; No matter how lax or unspoken the definition, no matter how the mortal drove themselves half-mad trying to avoid that, it should have triggered <em>anyways.</em>&nbsp; The resulting penalty clauses do not nullify the compact, but produce a less stringent interpretation of Hell's side and a more stringent interpretation of Abrogail Thrune's.</p>
            <p>Given that it hasn't triggered, the devil who negotiated that compact is not having a good century.&nbsp; It isn't that Asmodeus hasn't benefited from the pact, or that Asmodeus isn't receiving enough of a share of the gains, or even that He is displeased with the results, <em>it's the principle of the thing.</em></p>
            <p>Abrogail Thrune has never once spoken aloud what it meant to her when she signed her compact, to not betray Asmodeus in the depths of her own heart, lest anyone use that knowledge against her. &nbsp;It is simply this: she gets to have her fun, and Asmodeus gets to have His.</p>
            <p>"You know as well as I do that it would be good for her," says Abrogail Thrune. "It would be so, <em>so</em> good for her."</p>
            <p>"We are not <em>here </em>to do what is good for Sevar," says Aspexia Rugatonn.&nbsp; "We were explicitly instructed <em>not to be proactive about her correction.</em>"</p>
            <p>"You were.&nbsp; I was not.&nbsp; Asmodeus cannot have failed to predict that she would catch my interest."</p>
            <p>"He most certainly <em>can </em>have failed to predict it. &nbsp;He can have failed to predict that Hell's exact wording would leave you a loophole, and a rather arguable loophole at that. &nbsp;Our Lord has other things on His mind and cannot devote all of His attention to Cheliax.&nbsp; Complications like these, which require more of His attention, are <em>already </em>injuries and expenses to Him.&nbsp; And <em>now,</em> of all times, He is gravely distracted, and may not see what is happening here at all."</p>
            <p>For all her Splendour bonuses, Abrogail can't compete with Aspexia for sternness, but neither is she that easily swayed from her desires. &nbsp;"You may recall that when I was negotiating with your Lord's agent to take this throne in the first place, there is a specific clause I added to the effect that His high priests would not tell me to never have any fun.&nbsp; Keep to your Lord's bargain, Aspexia."</p>
            <p>"Operative word <em>never</em>," Aspexia says sharply. &nbsp;"I've accepted you turning good Asmodeans into statues and burying them, because most souls are of little importance to our Lord, because there could be a discipline problem otherwise among those who truly look forward to Hell. &nbsp;You may continue to have that fun in the future. &nbsp;<em>This </em>soul is of importance to our Lord <em>and </em>to your country of Cheliax <em>and </em>to our Lord's longer purposes in Golarion.&nbsp; <em>Otolmens has appointed an oracle.&nbsp; The gods are at war.</em>&nbsp; You need to <em>stop introducing complications</em>."</p>
            <p>"Unfortunately, as I do now admit, I did not realize, on first meeting Sevar, the effect my threat would have on her; and that, I do worry, may be a complication.&nbsp; The transcripts of her thoughts show that, despite my attempted reassurance, she continues to be distracted by thoughts of me doing terrifying things to her.&nbsp; So now I have to actually do them to her.&nbsp; Slowly.&nbsp; It's the only way to undo my own past folly."</p>
            <p>"Hardly the only way," observes the most actually intelligent entity in the room, in a low grumbling growl, though this level of Intelligence is not required to see the obvious. "You could swear to Sevar the same oath, without first pretending to turn her into a statue."</p>
            <p>"<em>But then I would never get to slowly petrify her!</em>"</p>
            <p>"Why have our existences become this?" wonders Contessa Lrilatha on a more private channel.&nbsp; "How did we offend our Lord?&nbsp; Will we ever be allowed to return to Hell?"</p>
            <p>Gorthoklek replies with a brief proverb in Infernal.&nbsp; It carries with it the sense of 'Hell is other people', of 'This is Hell nor are we out of it', of 'Hell is not a place but a philosophy', but the literal Infernal is simply 'Hell is the destruction of hope.'</p>

            <p>Pilar Pineda has been in Elysium longer than Hell thinks.&nbsp; Not nearly long enough to get the full tour, but enough to be shown around a little, appropriately attired and appropriately treated, to see massive crystal-waterfalls in which glasslike material flows slowly down from what look like leagues and leagues up, to sleep briefly but refreshingly in a warm cavern lit by glowing edible moss, to meet interesting people and be mistreated by them in interesting ways.</p>
            <p>Long enough to be told what Elysium believes about what Hell really is, how Hell really works, and have it sworn to her in the name of Good and Chaos that they're telling the truth to the best of their own knowledge.&nbsp; They're not Lawful, yes, but it doesn't mean they're all liars, all the time.&nbsp; There are beings with spell-like abilities here to rival great wizards, and one shows Pilar a glimpse of Hell as it really is.</p>
            <p>To be clear, Pilar hasn't been here <em>that</em> long; this tour is being done in something of a rush.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham wakes, to light just beginning to filter in through the bedroom window.&nbsp; He is not used to sleeping through any more light than that, and, what with all the distractions, didn't even close the curtains before falling asleep cuddling a chained-up Carissa.</p>
            <p>Oh.</p>
            <p>He&nbsp;<em>can</em> sleep on the same surface, and even in the same poorly designed bed, as someone else.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; He can do that with Carissa; he doesn't particularly like the thought of doing it with anyone else that he currently knows.</p>
            <p>It's raining outside, moderately windy.&nbsp; It's not possible to see, underneath the clouds, if the sky is doing anything weird.</p>
            <p>Keltham starts to get the - key, how is&nbsp;<em>that</em> a key, he didn't want to interrupt sexytimes to ask Carissa this, last night, but <em>you can literally just look at it and see how it must fit into the lock.</em>&nbsp; Why couldn't you just look at the shape and remember it, and then make another key like that, if you'd trained yourself a bit on fast memorization?&nbsp; Golarion really doesn't make much sense... well, maybe only sexy keys for bed chains are like this, because the person is chained up and it doesn't matter if they can remember the key's shape.</p>
            <p>He's carefully unlocking the keys before it occurs to him to wonder whether he actually wants to Carissa let out; after a few moments, he concludes that he doesn't want to do more - well, maybe he would, if he thought of things to do - but if he wasn't pushing himself into things -</p>
            <p>Keltham realizes he's being dumb; he knows how to think better than this, in familiar domains, knows that the Way there is not to question your ordinary wants so much except on rare special occasions of deliberate meta.&nbsp; He felt like letting Carissa out of the chains, so he's going to do that and not trip over questioning the impulse.&nbsp; If he made the wrong decision somehow by acting on that impulse, he'll find out and his brain will update its impulses.&nbsp; Besides, if he wants Carissa back in the chains, he can always put her back in them later.</p>
            <p>(A strange wash of warmth at that final thought, unfamiliar, but becoming quickly less so.)</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"Thank you," Keltham says in Taldane, and tries running through some words in his mind.&nbsp; It's harder to read the faint connotations than it was yesterday; Share Language doesn't want to override knowledge that you already have.&nbsp; Keltham has to focus hard on the internal probes and use some dath ilani techniques for hunting down subtle connotations that words and concepts have to you.</p>
            <p>'Lawful' is obsessing over your city's regulations and fretting over whether you're conforming enough to all of them, 'Chaos' is insanity, 'Good' is something put firmly underneath a sense of superiority that's alien to dath ilan, 'Evil' is being mean to people and not in a sexually sadistic way either.</p>
            <p>Keltham makes a note not to trust this particular person with anything if he can avoid it.&nbsp; Actually, he should check -</p>
            <p>'Asmodeus' doesn't return anything, nor 'Zon-Kuthon'.&nbsp; Somehow the spell knows that these are individual things rather than general concepts, no matter how much a dath ilani would say that no such qualitative difference exists, and isn't transferring them over as Shared Language.</p>
            <p>Keltham supposes that would have been an overly easy way of identifying traitors, at least those at or above second-circle wizardry... no, that's trope-based thinking, and it is very far from certain that mode of thinking binds to reality here at all; so he needs to at least firmly <em>label</em> every use of it in an inference step, and then compute everything the other way too.&nbsp; If this technique is not forbidden to work by tropes, Keltham should be creative about making this method work, or just literally continue at all to think about how to make it work.</p>
            <p>'Pain'?&nbsp; Keltham can't get a read on it, he has a Baseline concept that the Taldane word maps onto almost exactly; Keltham already knows what this word means.&nbsp; This sort of outcome is presumably the reason why Golarion folks don't think of this as a standard probe to use on each other.</p>
            <p>Dath ilani however do not have a single commonly-used concept that corresponds exactly to the connotations and meanings of the Taldane word 'torture'*, and Keltham can get something of a read on that; 'torture' sounds awfulscary rather than desirable.</p>
            <p>Okay, probably not a Kuthite traitor then, to the extent this method works at all.<br><br></p>
            <p>(*) &nbsp;The Baseline compound phrase that refers-by-convention to 'deliberately inflicting extreme amounts of pain' carries primarily the connotation of overly large negative payoffs in decision matrices and edgelord thought experiments devised by teenage males, not the idea that you can obtain information or obedience that way.<br><br></p>
            <p>(From the perspective of anybody watching, Keltham just said 'Thank you', closed the door, and then shut his eyes and stood motionless for about a minute.)</p>

            <p>Keltham remembers what he saw in Early Judgement, and thinks about his desire to engage in mutually beneficial interaction with the God of Coordination, the god who runs the afterlife of golden gondolas that are sold and not given away, because money symbolizes mutual benefit that spreads out beyond two people bartering directly, and that is what binds people helping each other into a Civilization even of many life forms.&nbsp; Whatever spells his god thinks he should have today to serve that goal and make skyscrapers in Golarion, those are the spells Keltham wants.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Pilar Pineda wakes in the dawn light of Elysium, still immersed in the pool of glowing slimes where she was resting that night. It seems that she is no longer chained, no longer bears those marks that tell Elysians how to mistreat her.&nbsp; She is as naked, now, as when she first appeared here; though the pool slimes would be protecting her modesty if Asmodean wizard students were allowed to retain any.</p>
            <p>Standing before her is the bizarre, brightly colored, un-reality-resembling form of Cayden Cailean's - herald?&nbsp; Delegate?&nbsp; It's not clear what she is in many senses, just that she (or is it She?) obeys, or, as the locals would have it, 'works with', Cayden Cailean.</p>
            <p>Pilar knows, even before She speaks, what She will say.</p>
            <p>"They'll call you very soon," says She to Pilar.&nbsp; "Are you still sure you want to go back?"</p>
            <p>"Yes I am sure," Pilar says firmly.&nbsp; "And, if it's in any way possible, I don't want to come here next time.&nbsp; Even if I can't get Maledicted in time, don't take me here again, just let me get my proper trial from Pharasma.&nbsp; I belong in Hell.&nbsp; And yes, I know that when I'm in Hell, I'll many times wish I was here.&nbsp; But I'm <em>actually</em> Lawful Evil, and this was a lovely place to visit, but it's not where I belong."</p>
            <p>The strange being nods Her head.&nbsp; "Okay."</p>
            <p>Pilar was expecting more of an argument.&nbsp; "Okay?" she repeats.</p>
            <p>"An it harm none other, do as ye will!&nbsp; It may not be the whole of the Law, but it sure is a great big part of Chaotic Good!&nbsp; We're not going to keep you here if <em>you</em> say you'd rather be somewhere else."</p>
            <p>From far away, Pilar hears the call. &nbsp;<em>Yes, </em>she answers, with her mind, with her soul, and a majority if not the absolute entirety of her heart.&nbsp; <em>Yes, I want to go back. &nbsp;To serve Asmodeus in Golarion, and then in Hell.</em></p>
            <p>And she feels herself start to fade.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She's fading really very slowly, for some reason, and seems to basically be still here.</p>
            <p>"Time is running super fast for us right now, relative to Golarion," says the strange being.&nbsp; "I am willing that it be so.&nbsp; Raise Dead takes a minute to cast, and it turns out, there's a few more things you need to hear before you go!"</p>
            <p>"Is this where you spring some sort of Chaotic Good trap on me?" Pilar says suspiciously.</p>
            <p>"No.&nbsp; It's where I tell you that&nbsp;Cayden Cailean <em>won't </em>be able to take you, if you die for real.&nbsp; He was only able to get away with this <em>because</em> you were going to go back and Cayden Cailean knew that.&nbsp; You're right, Lawful Evil to Chaotic Good is something of a stretch.&nbsp; We could arrange a visit, but we can't offer you citizenship, not really."</p>
            <p>Pilar now has additional questions.&nbsp; "Wait - if I could never stay here in the first place, why did you keep asking me if I really wanted to go back to Golarion and go on to Hell - why send me on this whole tour to convince me to say no to the Raise Dead -"</p>
            <p>The strange being laughs Her strange high-pitched cheerful laugh.&nbsp; "Well, because it was important that you knew for yourself, you see!&nbsp; There's not many people who can go to Hell with a whole heart, or who really and truly want to belong to Asmodeus when Asmodeus cares so little about them.&nbsp; Many, many, many fewer people than have convinced themselves that they're okay with it."&nbsp; The strange being looks sad, now.&nbsp; "Not many people in Cheliax would make the decision you just did, if they had really been to Elysium, and if they really thought they could stay.&nbsp; If Asmodeus's followers had any sense they'd throw you a huge party about it, when you got back to Golarion, but they won't do that either.&nbsp; Most of them won't want to admit, if they even let themselves know it, that they would never do what you did."</p>
            <p>On reflection, the Elysians never once did tell her explicitly that she could stay, just kept on asking her if she was <em>sure </em>she wanted to go back.&nbsp; "What in the name of Asmodeus... um.&nbsp; What is Cayden Cailean&nbsp;<em>planning?</em>&nbsp; Why&nbsp;<em>do</em> that?"&nbsp; She doesn't expect them to just actually tell her, but, Chaotic Good outsider, she should at least try.</p>
            <p>"You don't think it's just the sort of thing that Chaotic Good people do?"</p>
            <p>"No," says Pilar.&nbsp; "This is way, waaay, <em>waaaay</em> too much effort for just getting one Asmodean to know for certain that she's an Asmodean, when, in fact, she already knew that."&nbsp; (Elysium has affected her speech patterns, Pilar notes, she'd better watch that when she gets back.)</p>
            <p>"Did she really know it, though?&nbsp; There'd be an awful lot of Asmodeans who said they were certain they were Asmodeans, who'd never let themselves think that wasn't true.&nbsp; But if they were in Elysium and had the chance to stay, they'd say yes in a heartbeat.&nbsp; Could you know you weren't one of those, if you hadn't really tried it?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, I could, actually," Pilar says.&nbsp; "But more importantly, that is not the whole point of this operation.&nbsp; What is?"</p>
            <p>The strange being slyly winks one of the inhumanly huge, luminous white-black-blue-white eyes in Her head.&nbsp; "Well, <em>that </em>would be telling.&nbsp; But, guess what - the part where Cayden Cailean turned you into His oracle is going to help Asmodeus, in the end!"</p>
            <p>"<em>Really.</em>"</p>
            <p>"Really!&nbsp; You're truly loyal to Asmodeus, Pilar.&nbsp; I'm not going to say we'd <em>never</em> use somebody like you against her own god, but it's still the sort of thing that Good prefers not to do.&nbsp; According to Asmodeus's own values, He'll be better off in the world where Pilar Pineda became an oracle of Cayden Cailean than in the world where you didn't.&nbsp; Obviously that's not the real point from Cayden Cailean's perspective, but it still happens to be true."</p>
            <p>Chaotic Good and Lawful Evil don't have a whole lot of common interests, but they do have some.&nbsp; "...Is this about keeping Rovagug sealed, or the Worldwound, or something?"</p>
            <p>"One of those three for sure!"</p>
            <p>Pilar can feel herself to have almost entirely faded, now.&nbsp; Golarion is calling her, it's not her home, but it's on her way.</p>
            <p>"And maybe it's not the real point either," says the un-reality-looking bright-pink sort-of-horse, "but with so many people in Hell, who don't want to be there, it would be sad if one of the very few people who did want to be there, couldn't go.&nbsp; Asmodeus isn't a friend to anyone, but that doesn't mean He doesn't need anyone to be a friend to Him.&nbsp; After all, sometimes -"</p>
            <p>Pilar hears the last words with her soul's mind more than her soul's ears.</p>
            <p><em>"-&nbsp;friendship can be the greatest magic of all!"</em></p>

            <p>Pilar's back, carrying a story that got her instantly kicked to the almost-but-not-quite-absolute-top-priority line to talk to Aspexia Rugatonn, which is, unfortunately, a pretty long line while the gods are at war.</p>
            <p>Sevar&nbsp;<em>is unfortunately the expert</em> on whatever the <em>Abyss</em>&nbsp;this Second Law business is about.&nbsp; Maillol can <em>barely</em> understand any of the game Sevar is playing against Keltham's mastery of the Law he's already lectured on.&nbsp; If it wasn't for Sevar's thought transcripts, nobody else reading the surface conversation would've realized that there was a great mystery here in the first place.</p>
            <p>Still, even with everyone incredibly busy, there's probably <em>somebody</em> here in the palace who can beat Keltham's Will save on Detect Thoughts with enough reliability to make it worth the risk.&nbsp; Though they should probably ready a story about Nidal infiltrators in case that person fucks up.</p>
            <p>Anyways, Maillol can't think of anything besides sending in somebody to ask Keltham why he thinks one girl is a hidden Kuthite cleric, and hoping that makes him think about the Second Law.&nbsp; Maybe have somebody go in who's old and impressive-looking and wearing a big visible intelligence headband so that Keltham is more likely to try to explain to them than to Sevar.&nbsp; All they need is for one of Cheliax's three eighth-circle wizards to have the time available for a Detect Thoughts.&nbsp; During a war with Nidal.&nbsp; Well, there's also always Aspexia Rugatonn, it's not like she'd be busy.&nbsp; Or Gorthoklek, as the general of Cheliax's armies this must be like a vacation for him.</p>

            <p>"There's been a suggestion to have a third party tell Keltham useful things about your sexuality, preferably true ones, that he might be hesitant to believe from you directly.&nbsp; Such as that you are attracted to him in part because of the actual power he holds over you, in the sense that you know Cheliax would let him do anything to you if he made that a condition of cooperating with us, and that if he never exercises any power over you, you may lose some interest.&nbsp; Supposedly we know how you work because people with lots of experience with submissives can guess that by looking closely at you and how you behave around Keltham, as some people in our 'Governance' are of course doing in the background.&nbsp; That Cheliax would let him do anything he wanted would be true in every sane country in the world and Taldor specifically and therefore, goes the argument, passes your condition on how we tell him Cheliax works."</p>

I am not sure who he'd trust to hear it from - maybe Ione, if she recovers, maybe Pilar - I do predict that most possible ways of saying to him 'you know, you can actually not-for-pretend do whatever you want' result in a freakout like the one he had over the idea that you get executed for trying to overthrow the government, but there might be something -</p>

            <p>- if I were trying to broach it to him, which has the disadvantage that I'm not going to say I'll get bored if he doesn't keep up, what I'd say is that I disliked it in the sex shop how it seemed like it was set up for mostly people who wanted to - pretend - and that if I wanted that I'd have said to him 'act like you can do whatever you'd like to me, until I tell you to stop', or something, and I didn't, and that a consequence of what I said instead, as far as Cheliax is concerned, is that he is, actually, entitled to do whatever he'd like, and if he wanted to chain me up again and I was being difficult about it he could call in Security and no one'd blink at that, and even though I expect he's nowhere near the point where he'd enjoy my being defiant <em>I</em> like knowing it's real.</p>

Another option, because I think he's going to want to talk about exclusivity in a little while, is to have someone drop in and ask him if they can rent me, and give a justification along these lines." Carissa has a hard time pinning down a lot of her intuitions about Keltham but she expects that he will have some kind of feelings about 'look, she's into stuff that's much more serious than you are prepared to offer', and if that take is given by someone with an obvious self-interest then it's also easier if it's disastrous for him to reject it without reaching any far-reaching conclusions about Cheliax. Also, whether he ends up agreeing or not he'll end up wanting to learn the skills he doesn't have, and also it seems like fertile territory for 'things he might turn out to be into'.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><br>Maillol is in fact concerned about the degree to which Sevar seems to be developing genuine attachment for Keltham, but the last time she spoke out of that attachment she made tremendous progress <em>on</em> Keltham, because it fit into whatever mysterious theories he uses.&nbsp; Maillol still thinks, on the whole, that in the ordinary course of Asmodeus's Law he would not correct her yet.&nbsp; Of course, that would be because he was regarding her as a disposable pawn, but if that's what Sevar proves to be, so be it.</p>

            <p>He does receive his spells this time, though with no sense of his own god looking back.</p>

            <p>(Create Water seems like the most munchkinable thing that's a cantrip.&nbsp; Which isn't very munchkinable, but at 4 gallons per caster circle, maybe he can do <em>something</em> with repeatably suddenly 16 gallons of water, in an emergency situation.)</p>
            <p>1st:&nbsp; Truthspell x3, Fairness x2, Sanctuary, Protection, Comprehend Languages.</p>
            <p>2nd:&nbsp; Augury x3, Owl's Wisdom, Early Judgment.</p>
            <p>Taking the Early Judgment spell seems a little unsafe, like they'd only sell that magic in a Shop of Ill-Advised Consumer Goods because it's too potentially addictive.&nbsp; But it also seems important to have around at least for today in case he needs to make a mental recovery.</p>
            <p>3rd:&nbsp; (used on 2 1sts and a 2nd)</p>
            <p>4th:&nbsp; Enchantment Foil, what should be Sending.</p>

            <p>Then Keltham attempts to think for a bit, his thoughts tentatively trying out a review of recent events, before he concludes that in fact he shouldn't do that and should try to decompress more instead, while he's alone by himself in the quiet but for the sound of rain outside.</p>
            <p>He'll&nbsp;poke through the fourteen-volume history on 'Absalom', which becomes more interesting after it becomes clear that Absalom is where the Starstone resides.&nbsp; The quality of the reasoning in the history books is something like six times better than those of the books in the villa library, more like 1 reasoning error per 2 sentences instead of 3 reasoning errors per 1 sentence.</p>
            <p>...is that because the palace can afford better books than - but why - why would - <em>books, information,</em> you should just be able to reprint the best versions of things if the information&nbsp;<em>exists</em> - do more intelligent authors demand incredibly high book royalties to the point where most people can't afford good information about basic subjects?&nbsp; Golarion <em>why.</em></p>
            <p>The book's contents seem to be dated to before Aroden died, which, if Keltham is recalling correctly, was a century ago.&nbsp; Maybe that's <em>at least </em>how long it took for the slightly smarter and better-reasoned book to have its copyright decay to where it could sell enough copies to be worth printing?&nbsp; Golarion, again, <em>why</em>?&nbsp; Information is very easy to copy once it exists; information on core topics is among the most blatant possible cases where Civilization has an interest in everybody being able to afford it.</p>

I didn't ask more questions because that sort of thing can be personal but I bet she'd tell you about it, if you ask. Asmodia's not back yet - Pilar ended up elevated priority because they wanted to ask her questions about how she ended up in our mission out of the villa -- but it sounds like she doesn't know any more than we do.

          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham is a bit startled that Carissa would just&nbsp;<em>tell&nbsp;</em>him that Pilar ended up in Elysium.&nbsp; That should've been something he had to figure out on his own by talking to Pilar, or investigating her, or something.&nbsp; Pilar should've been left more mysterious than that until their first date, or until he did something to appeal to her, if those tropes were governing here.&nbsp; Call it maybe 6 times as likely on the theory 'Chelish Governance asked Pilar "what" and found out a weird thing and promptly and sensibly told Carissa so she could tell me' as on the theory 'this is an ero-LARP'.&nbsp; With possible amendments if the Chaotic Good thing turns out to be itself much more mysterious; but still, Keltham making the first discovery that starts the mystery trail should require that he start Pilar's route, like, at all?&nbsp; Or maybe that happened when she took a +3 vicious nasty bigsword for him.</p>
            <p>But still a surprise, not advance-predicted, not the main thing the theory obviously says.&nbsp; You don't want to rationalize those out the window.&nbsp; Maybe call it 3:1 instead of 6:1, though.</p>
            <p>"Well, huh," Keltham says, "the details there would be a bit hard to explain, but that's some small evidence against the reasoning system I was using to infer that one of the girls is a secret Zon-Kuthon cleric, or that one of the more unusual girls in class will have the 'being-forced' fetish.&nbsp; Not decisive or anything, but noticeable jolt.&nbsp; The key is knowing how to keep track of that sort of thing over time, which is what I'd otherwise have planned to lecture on next, the Law for accumulating pieces of evidence that aren't individually decisive, until they add up to something."</p>
            <p>"Asmodia's going to - end up pretty behind, in a week, at the rate we were going.&nbsp; I'm not sure how much you can recover from that sort of thing by reading notes, in a situation like this one... well, maybe somebody else could teach Asmodia, to help solidify the material in their own minds by teaching it, that's a big part of the reason why older kids teach younger ones in dath ilan.&nbsp; Still, that'd be a big chunk of someone's time.&nbsp; Depending on how expensive a seventh-circle Regenerate is... well, except that they are going to do it at all, eventually, so we're not paying from zero.&nbsp; I probably want to expend some political capital on it happening <em>earlier,</em> if the project is considered competitive with war demands at all."</p>
            <p>"I&nbsp;<em>could</em> teach a class today, for sure.&nbsp; Whether I <em>should</em>... maybe not so much, if the view-from-above says that somebody in my position is supposed to take one day off, and it probably does."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>- telling Keltham about Pilar was a correct move in the Second Law game. Okay. Carissa doesn't understand why and would REALLY LIKE someone to read Keltham's thoughts and try to get more but it's - information, and as Keltham says, you can use a little of that at a time. "It might literally be cheaper to pass Asmodia a two-way mirror in Hell so she can keep up," she says. "But I think it's reasonable to press them on getting her back sooner."</p>
