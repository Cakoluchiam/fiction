            <p>...<em>good luck, Sevar,</em> thinks Abrogail, but then Sevar's had enough unexpected luck already that Asmodeus's hand there is clear.</p>
            <p>"Mm.&nbsp; That does present a... let us not say complication.&nbsp; Doing this in front of Carissa, instead of simply presenting her with a sealed agreement between us, presents us with a matter of something that you gain and something that I lose.&nbsp; What you gain is her affection; what I lose is something that I worry a dath ilani may not understand.&nbsp; It has to do with Asmodeus's domain of pride, which, being something that belongs to a god, is not intrinsically defined in mortal terms; but in mortal terms... maybe I could say that I have a reputation for winning, and that you want me to do something that <em>could</em> be seen as losing.&nbsp; Not in private between ourselves, but where others, like Carissa, or for that matter Isidre, can see it."</p>

            <p>Did she doom herself to 'trope'hood by <em>that</em> not happening in front of Sevar?&nbsp; She doesn't think so; that was a duel between herself and Keltham and not one that was really over possession of Carissa at all.</p>
            <p>Well.&nbsp; Perhaps Sevar's thought was correct, perhaps everyone but her underestimates Keltham; he is doing better than she expected, even now.&nbsp; But at least to Abrogail, it seems like Keltham does flirt very close to the edges of losing his games and damning himself in one sense or another.&nbsp; He just needs to be encouraged to go on playing them.</p>
            <p>The Queen sighs.&nbsp; "I suppose we could have it be - the kind of favors owed that are understood not to be enforceable even in the eyes of Asmodeus?&nbsp; I am a little friendlier to you for borrowing Sevar, you are a little friendlier to me for making you look good in front of her."</p>
            <p>"Maybe what I really want is the acknowledgement that my pride has any value at all, in this.&nbsp; Especially since, as an outsider from a world lost completely to Good, you may not see or realize or understand the Evil thing that you are trampling on and perhaps also trample on it excessively."</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(This will give Carissa Sevar slightly more time to recover; since, it has by now been reported to Abrogail, the cute little idiot went and submitted herself to her any-time-in-three-days torture session right away, without making sure it happened sometime when she'd have an hour or two to herself to recover afterward.&nbsp; Was Sevar that stupid, that overconfident of her recovery ability, or had she just never previously gotten herself in important-project-screwup, mentally-insubordinate-to-the-Queen levels of trouble?&nbsp; Probably all three.</p>
            <p>It is <em>infuriating</em> that the child has gotten herself into a vital position where she needs to be accommodated for incompetence like that, rather than it being turned into a more object lesson.&nbsp; But they're planning to try out Lrilatha running Suggestion on Keltham; and while that is expected to go well, Sevar needs to be in better form to exploit whatever change Keltham has then in his thoughts.)</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p><em>Are</em> they done here? - Keltham asks himself.&nbsp; He didn't - get a chance to talk about, well, what's actually going to happen to Carissa.&nbsp; Which Keltham apparently needs to treat as an infohazard for probably like at least a month or something.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately Keltham came into this conversation with a clear goal, namely, get his brain into a position to decide whether it was comfortable renting Carissa to the Queen, but with no real idea of how to accomplish that goal.</p>
            <p>...internal interrogation suggests that, on the one hand, their overt interactions have not been very - sexy, doesn't really create any relationship where Keltham rents Carissa to her... oh.&nbsp; In retrospect, maybe <em>that's</em> what the Complicated Flirting was about; it was just that Keltham was much more worried when that happened, about the Queen possibly trying to open her eroLARP route at him, so he shut it down.&nbsp; He was probably not supposed to do that.</p>
            <p>Still, that the Queen flirted (<em>hopefully </em>just pseudo-flirted) at him, at all, is an acknowledgement of Keltham as a sexual-romantic-relationship-having-thing, and that is... possibly enough for whatever weird thing is inside him, Keltham does not understand the rules at all.&nbsp; Well, it's enough <em>provided that</em> the Queen is in fact incredibly hot, which she is.</p>
            <p>But maybe add safety margin?&nbsp; Why do something your brain just barely approves of, when you could do&nbsp;<em>not that.</em></p>
            <p>"I think the dath ilani thing to do in this situation, if it could manage to come up in dath ilan, is that we both tell each other a mildly embarrassing naughty story from our early sexual experiences, in a way meant to acknowledge that the other person's story is sexy and funny, and then we have a relationship that is not just about project management or 'trope' avoidance and my brain is more confident that I can rent Carissa to you."</p>

            <p>It's the wrong thought, and she tucks it away quickly; the primary point of the punishment was that her superiors are better than her, have more experience operating under these conditions and are absolutely competent to handle them, and that she is wrong, when she thinks she's right and they're mistaken.

            <p>Onward to his important meeting!&nbsp; In which he will demand to Chelish Governance that they be prepared to deliver Sevar to him restrained and to be his owned object if she ever falls in love with the Queen of Cheliax!<br><br></p>
            <p>...was Isidre lying about the entire Carissa sex thing in order to make him look like a lunatic and sabotage him in front of the Queen and her advisors no that would make no sense because he asked Carissa and Carissa said it was hot so this should be something they recognize as a totally normal way of thinking; and if not he will truthspell himself and then recount exactly what Isidre told him.</p>

            <p><em>And also</em> Keltham's worried about Carissa's heart being stolen away from him - not least by her possible delusion that Carissa's own person could possibly be taken away from him, even by the Queen of Cheliax, if Keltham himself had decided to get serious about keeping her - so he now, as indeed the greater part of his compensation for this rental, demands that before he hands over Carissa, the Queen sign such agreements as will duly incentivize her to attempt no such thing and ensure a correct outcome for her if she does.&nbsp; If by untampered truthspell it is proven that Carissa has come to love the Queen and to love her more than she loves Keltham, then Keltham has the right to walk out on all this shit not withstanding other bargains to be signed later, and haul Carissa's chained-up ass away with him, if he chooses.</p>

            <p>This is definitely bad for Carissa, the only person who any involved party can permissibly torture, which makes it hard to take any real enjoyment from, but she can abstractly appreciate the skill.</p>

In Baseline, obviously; it would take too long to say in Taldane, and make Keltham very uncomfortable if spoken in Infernal. "The economicmagic under discussion causes the target's mind to be externally influenced and proceed in such fashion as to end up containing thoughts chosen by the causal originator of the economicmagic, these thoughts being not distinguished to introspection from thoughts arising naturally, morever lending these thoughts a quality by which they seem believable and other thoughts will flow into conformance with them, and if done skillfully and by a powerful caster this may be unnoticed even retrospectively,"&nbsp;</p>

There are two things that affect uptake in the general population of a new option: how expensive it is, and how much it requires basic capacity to function in the world. For example, a contraceptive option that requires a person to go in once a week for an appointment, even if the appointment is free, will be effective only for the approximately thirty percent of humans who can do something once a week in order to achieve their long term goals."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"That is correct. A third circle wizard attempting this against a fourth-circle cleric would be detected instantaneously, not even retroactively, in more than half of cases, and my best guess is that they would certainly be detected retroactively in virtually all of the rest; detecting the spell retroactively isn't usually considered hard, unless the caster's skill is unparalleled. The degree of skill necessary to cast the spell undetectably with decent reliability is possessed only by myself, the Queen herself, and perhaps a handful of other casters in Cheliax, all of whom are deployed elsewhere. If you would like, your Carissa can be taught the spell so you can experience having it cast on you by a third-circle caster, even a skilled one."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"I have, on my understanding of the understanding between myself and Cheliax, some informal credit with the Chelish government in exchange for that not-intended-to-be-proprietary information I have already been providing to you; I call due some small part of that informal credit now, if any such credit is needed."</p>
            <p>"I have not yet come to decisions regarding my having children here.&nbsp; But it has been represented to me by Carissa Sevar that use of the spell 'Alter Self' to male is sufficient to reliably prevent and terminate female pregnancy; I ask you to affirm whether this is so."</p>
            <p>"In dath ilan, were a child between us developing within her, either the mother or the father would independently have the legal right to terminate that pregnancy up to half the standard pregnancy-duration, after which it requires consent of both parties."</p>
            <p>"I know not what standard legal protections exist here, but I would have a contract negotiated between myself, Carissa, Cheliax, and potentially other female parties to become signatory; which says that, if a pregnancy is not past half the standard duration of pregnancy, I have the right to demand that Carissa Sevar, or other parties to be added, cast 'Alter Self' as needed in my opinion to prevent pregnancies that might have come from me."</p>
            <p>"Being a party to this contract may be terminated at will by myself, but by them only after casting 'Alter Self' in a fashion sufficient to prevent any pregnancy that might exist, including latent pregnancies requiring casting after a delay, if those are a thing.&nbsp; Moreover should the other parties simply refuse to cast that spell, the Chelish government will at my demand terminate that pregnancy at once, by such forcible external means as may be standard, up to and including their death and resurrection if there are no simpler means.&nbsp; Nor may a party to this contract leave the reach of Chelish Governance without either my consent or having terminated this contract first, including any castings of 'Alter Self' required to terminate that contract."</p>
            <p>"If there's anything I missed there in order to have sex safely and without worrying about a child that only one of us wanted, please say so."</p>
            <p>"Carissa, if there's anything I'm missing from your own perspective, please say so too."</p>
            <p>"It seems also to me that you, Contessa Lrilatha, write these contracts easily and that it is not very much of an informal favor at all, to ask you to write this one in Taldane; but if I am wrong about that and it requires a greater informal favor than I realize, please say so."<br><br></p>
            <p>The amount of additional anti-child security he can get through any precautions weirder than that does not seem worth mentioning, given both what they can do with Suggestions and haven't, and that if they were being really clever they could've gotten his precious bodily fluids via the oral sex he already had.&nbsp; You can be more paranoid anywhere, but not all marginal paranoia is marginally useful.</p>

You should be aware, if you are not, that abortion is under most circumstances judged as an Evil act by the goddess who judges such things, Pharasma. She has Her own convictions about whether it is a moral good to a person to bring them into existence; as She created this whole system, you might predict She is broadly in favor, and tends not to find it credible that an abortion is an act for the benefit of the person thereby prevented from being, and also tends to weight it as an act of high consequence. So expect, if you do it a lot, to count as Evil eventually; I don't think that's an unpleasant consequence, but now it's also not unexpected."</p>

            <p>...and looks at the contract, somewhat unhappily. It's just incredibly stupid, on principle, to sign something a devil wrote for you, after an amount of review that can plausibly happen now without destroying the mood. The fact she can't see anything wrong with it doesn't mean that much and the fact that there's the clause about no unpleasant surprises means - more, but not enough. However, they don't want to get Keltham the impression that one should treat Lrilatha's contracts as even potentially adversarial.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Well, what's going to happen to her is already only bounded by Asmodeus's unknowable will and the fact that apparently being tortured enough makes her short-term worse at her job.</p>
            <p>She signs without any visible hesitation, after a respectable amount of time reading it which nonetheless would not be enough to catch a clever trap.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Even in an authoritarian country answering to Hell, it's not easy to prevent rumors, at their tech level and social level. &nbsp;There are too many people, especially in the Imperial Palace, with enough self-considered impunity that they'd whisper a few words among each other, or ask questions of another. &nbsp;Security may stamp out rumors elsewhere, but they've got to be able to exchange whispered rumors among <em>themselves </em>to do their job correctly; or at least, that's what Security wizards sure seem to think. &nbsp;Or Asmodean nobles. &nbsp;Or priests of Asmodeus.&nbsp; They're members of the Inner Ring, and privileged to be the ones who trade rumors if they want, while stamping down hard on all loose talk among the Outers who don't need to think, just be told.</p>
            <p>And Cheliax doesn't think about informational security the same way dath ilan does. &nbsp;They don't have an explicit concept of information theory and probabilistic entanglement and improbable observations narrowing down probable worlds. &nbsp;If a top-secret Civilization project requests two hundred mice, and most other projects don't do that, then the mouse order is also obviously top secret, period, your job isn't to figure out what an adversary could deduce from a piece of unusual information but to deny your adversaries as much information as possible. &nbsp;Even if you're at +3sd they may perhaps be at +5sd, and you won't see all the connections that they'll see.</p>
            <p>Dath ilani children's fiction is replete with cautionary tales of fools who assumed that some fact could not possibly be deduced from the scanty, unreliable information that some slightly less foolish person possessed. &nbsp;Adults, of course, read about more sophisticated and plausible errors than that.</p>
            <p>Not that every dath ilani has the deep information-theoretic security mindset either, to be clear. &nbsp;Any real information-theoretic-security expert of dath ilan - as opposed to some random punk kid on an airplane - would've told Keltham, during the Nidal attack on the villa, that as soon as his life was no longer in immediate danger, he needed to get the shit out of those Obviously Strange Clothes before he went into the villa and anyone project-uncleared got a close or extended look at him. &nbsp;No, <em>not </em>because an ideal agent could use a mere glance at the zipper to deduce precise manufacturing technology not currently known to Golarion. &nbsp;Because the clothes are <em>incredibly abnormal</em> and therefore a <em>highly improbable rare signal</em> and therefore represent a potentially <em>massive update</em> for any adversary who is smarter than you and making unknown deductions; seriously what the shit is Keltham thinking.</p>
            <p>A dath ilani proverb runs, "The most important part of any secret is the meta-secret that the secret exists." &nbsp;(Not literally always true, of course, e.g., consider public-key cryptography.) &nbsp;Cheliax has this concept deeply and instinctively for private interactions, hiding the very existence of secrets from adversaries who'd want to pry them out of you. &nbsp;It doesn't think in quite the same way about most secret government projects, unless there's a specific and obvious reason why a secret also needs to be meta-secret. &nbsp;Tyrannies are not based on a deep respect and worry for what your lessers could do with the information they have, if they were secretly master criminals opposed to you. &nbsp;In an Asmodean tyranny, if you order someone not to think about something or ask any further questions, they don't ask any further questions and make a sincere try not to think about it. &nbsp;That, and not hiding the very existence of the secret itself from anyone, is the first line of defense around secret government projects in Cheliax.</p>
            <p>So if a top-secret Chelish project asks for a budget estimate on two hundred mice, the project manager will think about whether they believe anything top-secret seems obviously deducible from the mouse request; and if there's an obvious way to deduce something genuinely ultra-top-secret, they'll mark the mouse order as being also genuinely ultra-top-secret. &nbsp;Otherwise, it will soon be widely rumored within the Inner Ring - this being something that would make dath ilani informational security experts spit out their drinks - that a top-secret Chelish project ordered two hundred mice, no, nobody's allowed to ask for what. &nbsp;When Abrogail Thrune issues an order, it's put forth under Crown authority so everybody knows how important it is and what happens to them if they fuck up; rather than being issued anonymously with a quantitative priority that isn't any higher than it has to be to get that job done, rounded up to make the exact quantity less revealing.</p>
            <p>Even Hell thinks that it's fine for random contract devils in Dis to know everything their owned souls know; they won't <em>repeat </em>it, right, who cares if their behavior changes in externally observable ways given their knowledge. &nbsp;Hell is playing their informational security game against mortals in Golarion, not gods or dath ilani.</p>

            <p>From a Chelish standpoint? &nbsp;You can't figure out what Project Lawful is really doing from hearing that it's called Project Lawful. &nbsp;Why, it probably even gives Cheliax's enemies the wrong idea, if the name leaks somehow! &nbsp;Nobody's going to figure out the existence of Keltham or deduce a prospect of revolutionary military advances from <em>that</em>. &nbsp;So the name 'Project Lawful' is fine to tell to people who are not allowed to know what Project Lawful is about.</p>
            <p>And let's face it, 'Project Lawful' is a really cool name. &nbsp;'Lawful' is a powerful but standard concept that could potentially mean all <em>sorts </em>of specific things. &nbsp;Very evocative, while also very mysterious. &nbsp;Slightly ominous. &nbsp;You could say it's a tease.</p>
            <p>As for whether it is in fact a good idea to assign a top-secret project a really cool name, well, that is something of a separate issue.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>When military teams responded to the Nidal attack, they had been very quickly informed that there was a Lawful-Neutral detecting boy there wearing strange clothing who must be (a) protected at all costs (b) not told or shown that Cheliax is evil; <em>but </em>they were also told that this instruction was never to be repeated to literally anyone or asked about further, and that <em>is </em>an instruction you follow in Cheliax. &nbsp;If the boy in strange clothing then channels positive energy to heal some of the response teams (dath ilani actual security expert: AAAAAAAAAAIIIIEEEE), you're obviously likewise not supposed to ever ask anything about that, or repeat it as gossip.</p>
            <p>But the response team also, for example, found a burned-out archduke's villa in which most of the Security were dead and a handful of pretty female wizard students had mostly survived.</p>
            <p>They saw a literal actual godwar start shortly after this mysterious attack by Nidal.</p>
            <p>They hear rumored, even - and again, here dath ilani informational-security experts spit out their drinks - that the attack had somehow been foretold a half-minute in advance. &nbsp;Why wouldn't that be something you could gossip about, if you were a privileged member of the Inner Ring? &nbsp;You haven't been told it's really seriously absolutely secret; and you haven't been told that because nobody sees how <em>that </em>information leaks the secret of Keltham. &nbsp;There's no particular, known government secret of Cheliax that the prophetic warning reveals; why would it be absolutely classified? &nbsp;Obviously, as a Security, you would not gossip about this with non-Security, unless it was really amusing somehow, because part of being in the Inner Ring is that you get to know and other people don't. &nbsp;But it's not attached onto something classified ultra-secret by a visible secret-leaking line of reasoning, so it's not <em>so </em>secret that even Security isn't allowed to talk about it.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Originally, all of the Inner Ring people among the combat response teams who dared ask at all, were told, at the time, only that the villa was part of a top-secret project into which they couldn't inquire further. &nbsp;And so they inquired no further. &nbsp;On paper it was still called Project Pet Outsider, then, so they obviously couldn't be told the project's name. &nbsp;It was clearly one of those things you're just supposed to not think about; and it was given no mental handle with which to persist it as a concept over time or compare it to other things known.</p>
            <p>Now, however, a Security directive has been issued that, to avoid accidental leakage of info in case the project name gets overheard, the project is to be renamed to 'Project Lawful'.</p>
            <p>And, as a result, it is also now known that the burned-out archduke's villa was being used by a 'Project Lawful', into which you are not to inquire further. &nbsp;This fact itself is not forbidden to be gossiped about within the Inner Ring, to be clear, it's just that you're not allowed to inquire <em>further</em>.</p>
            <p>That double handful of pretty female wizard students who survived inside a small villa library while most of the Security were dead? &nbsp;They are part of 'Project Lawful'. &nbsp;Do not inquire further.</p>
            <p>They somehow got advance warning a half-minute before the attack? &nbsp;Yeah, that's 'Project Lawful'. &nbsp;Don't inquire further.</p>
            <p>The unconscious young girl dressed like all the other supposedly wizard students, who shows to Aura Sight as projecting a Lawful Evil aura strong enough to go with a fourth-circle wizard? &nbsp;Shut up. &nbsp;Don't ask any further questions. &nbsp;She's part of 'Project Lawful'.</p>
            <p>A remarkable number of these apparently young girls who are supposedly unproven second-circle wizards seem to have acquired permanent arcane sight somehow, despite no illusions or shapechanges showing up on them? &nbsp;It's 'Project Lawful', you don't ask why or what's really going on.</p>
            <p>(The young man in strange clothes channeling positive energy?&nbsp; Him you don't talk about <em>period</em>. &nbsp;Not even a whisper to your best friend. &nbsp;You don't ask if he's part of 'Project Lawful' or not; you don't <em>think</em> any more questions.)</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Another concept that dath ilan has and Cheliax lacks, is the notion of the virality of a discussion topic. &nbsp;Gather five people in a hushed circle; let one say a thing, on subject matter X. &nbsp;While on average, each of the four other people there have &gt;0.25 items remaining to say, in response to the last items said, the discussion continues; if each reply provokes less than 1 total further replies, the discussion dies out.</p>
            <p>Questions you can actually settle by thinking about them do not <em>stay </em>viral. &nbsp;To stay viral they must somehow provoke the appearance of settleability, or some other reward of talking about them, without actually being resolvable.</p>
            <p>Civilization has always been very careful not to allow social media to exist - outside of fiction discussion boards, in which you can't really be objectively&nbsp;<em>wrong</em> about anything too important, and which thus serve as an ongoing dire example to all Civilization of what happens when you implicitly sort ideas by how controversial and hence viral they are.</p>
            <p>(Well, if you dare to engage in Ill-Advised Online Consumerism, you can look at what happens when you do that with other topics too, not just fiction.&nbsp; But dath ilani do not usually do that. &nbsp;Why would they? &nbsp;Obviously it's Ill-Advised for a reason, one that they have no particular motivation to override as an exception. &nbsp;Dath ilani do not grow up inside the mental world of an adversarial cognitive environment where most secrets are being kept for someone else's good and their own harm, and must clearly be uncovered as quickly as possible. &nbsp;They've had a huge number of secrets kept from them as children and then they've grown up and found out that, sure, there were very reasonable reasons for all of that, it <em>was </em>for their own good or the good of Civilization after all.)</p>
            <p>The difference between a conversation topic where each remark provokes &lt;0.8 remarks, and a conversation topic where each remark provokes &gt;1.0 remarks, for an extended duration, is much like the difference between a greater-fire fission reaction where each neutron breaks loose &lt;1 other neutrons and &gt;1 other neutrons. &nbsp;It determines whether the reaction goes critical or not. &nbsp;The effects are not linear.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>People can think up new bright variations on rumors and try whispering those, and some of those variations are more viral and propagate differentially. &nbsp;Given that this is so, why don't all rumors always constantly mutate further and further to create versions of invincible virality?</p>
            <p>And the answer as to why this does not happen routinely among the Inner Ring of Cheliax - leaving aside that they don't have fiction discussion boards per se - is that the Inner Ring is not without its prideful skepticism. &nbsp;To repeat a rumor that cannot possibly be true, the sort of thing only Outers would believe, is to look foolish. &nbsp;The known facts about the archduke's villa and the Nidal attack are not <em>so </em>outrageous that, given their established truth, you ought to consider believing almost anything else you hear about Project Lawful.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the facts from the Nidal attack are not <em>all </em>that is known, now, about Project Lawful.</p>
            <p>Even if you're a Security, a priest, or a noble, even if you think you're part of the Inner Ring, you can't easily get a peek at Carissa Sevar of Project Lawful. &nbsp;Sevar is only rarely visible outside the extremely restricted area of the Imperial Palace where she usually stays, doing who-knows-what, and only particular top Security elites are allowed to read her mind anymore. &nbsp;These are interesting facts, but not skepticism-shattering ones. &nbsp;As for the Lawful Neutral boy in strange clothes, people really <em>aren't </em>talking about him, and the military responders who saw him personally are mostly fighting at the front; the Inner Ring rumor circle doesn't <em>collectively </em>know he exists.</p>
            <p>However.</p>
            <p>Carissa Sevar is not the only part of Project Lawful currently to be found in the Imperial palace in Egorian.</p>
            <p>A certain other person - who, as the only visible sample, may be presumed to be representative of 'Project Lawful girls' in general - has absolutely not been living her life in any way that would deescalate this issue.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Even for Golarion, this is not business as usual.</p>
            <p>But it does seem to be true. &nbsp;Credible sources of rumor have repeated the key facts, there are multiple accounts.</p>
            <p>Maybe other things... might also be true?<br><br></p>
            <p>Skepticism breaks, not completely, but far enough to permit mutation and variation to propositions more interesting than usual in an Inner-Ring rumor. &nbsp;The variety and strangeness of the rumors is sufficient that each 1 remark sparks &gt;1 other remarks, people competing to say what <em>they </em>heard; the host population is large enough that new mutated rumors are being originated in the host population faster than individuals get bored with old ones.&nbsp; Replication coefficients go past the critical threshold of 1, not to 1.05, but to 2+.</p>
            <p>A phenomenon is born that appears very rarely in Golarion. &nbsp;Any dath ilani who reads fiction discussion boards would immediately recognize it; the victims here don't even know what's feeding on them. &nbsp;It's gone past rumor, it's gone past avidly repeated rumor, it's gone past wild rumors that you can hear out in one night's drinking and that most people don't actually believe.</p>
            <p>In the heart of Cheliax within the Imperial palace in Egorian, among the members of the Inner Ring of Asmodeus's tyranny, 'Project Lawful' has become a meme.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rumors presently circulating about Project Lawful:</span></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Project Lawful was started because of a direct divine vision from Asmodeus Himself.</p>
              <p>The project manager of Project Lawful committed suicide and had to be severely tortured in Hell into consenting to be Raised before he was put back on the project.</p>
              <p>The top weapons enchanter at the entire Worldwound now works at Project Lawful instead. &nbsp;No she isn't <em>actually </em>third-circle, are you stupid?</p>
              <p>All of the Security wizards on Project Lawful have requested reassignment.</p>
              <p>Otolmens is very concerned about Project Lawful.&nbsp; [Rumored among Otolmens-cleared individuals only, of course.]</p>
              <p>The oldest Project Lawful girl is secretly the real leader of Project Lawful.</p>
              <p>If an event worth celebrating happens to you, one of the girls on Project Lawful will already be standing behind you and will offer you cake. &nbsp;It's good cake and eating it seems to be completely safe as far as anyone can tell. &nbsp;Nobody knows what happens if you refuse to eat it.</p>
              <p>You are not authorized to correct the heresies of Project Lawful.</p>
              <p>One of the Project Lawful girls is secretly Abrogail Thrune, no, you shut up, she totally does that to people.</p>
              <p>Nobody at the Palace knows where the original authorization for Project Lawful came from but everybody is afraid to be the one who takes responsibility for canceling it.</p>
              <p>Abrogail Thrune is negotiating with Project Lawful for the use of its women.</p>
              <p>When Project Lawful moved out of their previous location, they left behind sealed-up skeletons decades old despite having only been operating there for 2 days.</p>
              <p>No the cake girl doesn't give a shit what kind of Forbiddance is up or what kind of wards were on the room. &nbsp;Because Project Lawful that's why.&nbsp; Why yes, that does sound potentially useful if it could be controlled! &nbsp;In unrelated news I hear that Nidal's diamond supply is now in Cheliax for some reason and that their first strike in the war was on Project Lawful, did you think about that question for literally five seconds before opening your mouth?</p>
              <p>Starting a war among the gods isn't the most extreme thing Project Lawful has ever done, just the most extreme thing they couldn't cover up.</p>
              <p>Project Lawful originally started in an incredibly expensive archduke's villa that it took them nearly 2 full days to finish destroying - no, I heard it was mostly gone <em>before </em>the Nidal attack started -</p>
              <p>One Project Lawful girl believes she's one of only 12 people Aspexia Rugatonn really trusts - no seriously, that's what she was thinking to herself, the guy said - no, her thoughts weren't otherwise crazy -</p>
              <p>So apparently every devil in Hell has heard of Carissa Sevar by name. &nbsp;Because of resurrectees who reported to their contract devil, that's why. &nbsp;Yes, in principle that could be true, but <em>why </em>would it be only contract devils who work with Cheliax -</p>
              <p>Even Barons of Hell can't afford to buy the souls of Project Lawful girls in Dis's markets.</p>
              <p>I heard Carissa Sevar was chosen by Asmodeus Himself, no, they didn't say chosen for what exactly, that's classified -</p>
              <p>If Contessa Lrilatha, Gorthoklek, Aspexia Rugatonn, and Abrogail Thrune want to meet Carissa Sevar, and Carissa Sevar wants a nap, guess who gets notified when who else's nap gets finished.</p>
              <p>Project Lawful's manager once managed to piss off Aspexia Rugatonn, Contessa Lrilatha, and Gorthoklek, all in the same day. &nbsp;No shit it didn't turn out well for him. &nbsp;Needed his ass pulled out of the torture room by Asmodeus Himself. &nbsp;That absolutely happened, I was on duty. &nbsp;Yes a direct divine intervention to do that would be very surprising anywhere else. &nbsp;You're new to Project Lawful, aren't you? &nbsp;Project Lawful has never made it through an entire day without a direct divine intervention, the average is usually more like 3, and at some point the gods are literally going to run out of energy to prevent whatever it is they're trying to prevent.</p>
              <p>Are we actually sure that Hell itself knows what is going on with Project Lawful, I mean, has anyone actually summoned a senior devil and checked that they know, is what I'm trying to ask here - all right, that's fair, if Contessa Lrilatha has been spotted on-site then I'm less worried -</p>
              <p>One of Project Lawful's girls can see the future even with prophecy broken, and warned of a coming war with Nidal, but the project manager ignored her until it got to the point where she was yelling about incoming shadows in thirty seconds. &nbsp;Yeah 'oops' doesn't really cover it, Gorthoklek didn't think so either.</p>
              <p>The project manager of Project Lawful has been cursed by Pharasma Herself with all of Her malice.</p>
              <p>One of the girls on Project Lawful who died during the Nidal attack got sorted to Elysium - no, they Raised her successfully - well obviously she consented to be Raised so she could try harder for Lawful Evil next time, just as any faithful Asmodean would do in her place, now would you care to explain why you asked a question with such an obvious answer -</p>
              <p>One of the girls on Project Lawful is constantly calling out to Takaral, who is apparently a Neutral Evil herald of the god Nethys, not that anybody seems to think this could possibly be heretical or something.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus and Abadar are collaborating on Project Lawful.&nbsp; [Because the two gods are known collaborators and it's called 'Project Lawful', not because it leaked via knowledge about Keltham directly.]</p>
              <p>Asmodeus and Erecura are collaborating on Project Lawful.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus and Nethys are collaborating on Project Lawful.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus and Cayden Cailean are collaborating on Project Lawful.</p>
              <p>Oh, well, <em>I</em> heard that Asmodeus and <em>Milani </em>are collaborating on Project Lawful - yes of course I made that up just now, now how about you admit the Cayden Cailean thing is also made up -</p>
              <p>One of the girls in Project Lawful sometimes thinks about herself as belonging to Nethys, not that anybody else in Security seems to consider this could possibly represent a serious concern for multiple reasons.</p>
              <p>Nethys just fucking loves Project Lawful</p>
              <p>one of the girls on Project Lawful has been rigged to EXPLODE</p>
              <p>secret prediction markets in Osirion are giving odds of 1:8 that Project Lawful DESTROYS THE MULTIVERSE</p>
              <p>even the gods are forbidden to intervene in Project Lawful</p>
              <p>The discovery that started up Project Lawful was made by Carissa Sevar while she was serving at the Worldwound, no shit you're not allowed to ask what it is.</p>
              <p>Project Lawful has been instrumental in all of Cheliax's military victories over Nidal.</p>
              <p>One of the Project Lawful girls is secretly the heiress of a County and dresses accordingly.</p>
              <p>The library of Project Lawful looks tiny but apparently has as many books available as a major academy library, if someone asks the Project Lawful girl serving as a librarian to 'go look for them in another room', not that there's a Forbiddance in place or anything.</p>
              <p>The librarian of Project Lawful knows any time one of her books is damaged.</p>
              <p>The librarian of Project Lawful cannot leave her library and sleeps in a room inside it.</p>
              <p>Project Lawful 'wizard' girls have been spotted also casting cleric/oracle spells up to second circle.</p>
              <p>One of the Project Lawful 'girls' used 5 different cantrips in a day - well, I mean, she wasn't obvious about it, two different Securities had to compare notes to figure it out -</p>
              <p>One of the girls on Project Lawful is secretly the cleric of a god other than Asmodeus and nobody on Project Lawful knows who, including the girl herself. &nbsp;Yes, the question of how they know that <em>is </em>then an interesting question, and if we were talking about anything except for Project Lawful you might have a point.</p>
              <p>All of the Project Lawful girls were completely normal before they started working for Project Lawful, yeah, I know, right, it didn't sound very plausible to me either.</p>
              <p>So about the old halfling who detects as Lawful Neutral if you can detect him at all, the most interesting theory I've heard is that he's another form of The Old Man - yeah, I know it's confusing, but one of the heralds of Irori is apparently called that - how would I know why, maybe it's called 'Project Lawful' for a reason -</p>
              <p>A Lawful outsider is being held prisoner inside Project Lawful and interrogated for information.&nbsp; [Not a Keltham info leak except indirectly via the name 'Project Lawful'.]</p>
              <p>Project Lawful is intensively studying the history of Taldor in order to launch a team of operatives into Taldor's past which will convert Taldor to worship of Asmodeus in the present.</p>
              <p>The girls of Project Lawful are collaborating on writing a new kind of romance novel for official publication.</p>
              <p>Cheliax's most-senior retired honeypot instructor was summoned to teach a Project Lawful girl to corrupt paladins more effectively, but after reviewing transcripts the instructor said she was vastly out of her league and went home.</p>
              <p>Project Lawful goes through an awful lot of mice on a daily basis.</p>
              <p>Actually all the Project Lawful girls except Sevar are from the current graduating class at Ostenso wizard academy. &nbsp;No you shut up, I don't care how little sense that makes, my brother is attending that academy. &nbsp;Yeah that's the same thing I was thinking, they probably <em>were </em>normal girls at first, rounded up for an experiment, who got exposed to whatever it is that Project Lawful is studying.</p>
              <p>Project Lawful girls get to decide their own punishments, especially for heresy.</p>
              <p>Can we maybe talk in the first place about <em>why </em>everyone in Project Lawful who isn't Security is apparently a pretty girl or beautiful woman - we're not talking about that, okay, fine, we're not talking about it.</p>
              <p>Project Lawful reports are the only known thing that causes Aspexia Rugatonn to laugh.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham finishes letting Carissa out of her chains, and falls back into bed beside her.</p>
            <p>He feels like he's starting to get the hang of this whole 'just doing what <em>I </em>want in the cuddleroom' concept; it's strange and alien and he can still feel unworn sharp edges of his own ?????? reactions jolting him each time he moves, but he is generalizing quickly and mental motions are transitioning from unfamiliar to familiar.</p>
            <p>'Just do what I actually want in the cuddleroom' is not actually that complicated of an idea.&nbsp; And if Carissa can't easily have standard pleasure goals completed for her, then he may as well do what he wants and let her enjoy that without other pressures.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Maybe that's why the eroLARP gave her that exact sex problem in the first place</span> look he just had a really pleasant trope-free interaction, and it is possible there are not in fact any tropes, okay?</p>
            <p>His brain occasionally pokes him and says that he should do something nice for Carissa now, give her something that she wants.&nbsp; Keltham has to remind his brain that Carissa is probably not feeling him to be net in debt to her right now; even if, perhaps, the various things he's finished doing for her, are things that would not have made sense to Keltham as gifts to himself.&nbsp; Also he doesn't have 600gp in hand and also also he doesn't really know how to buy things yet...</p>
            <p>Eh, he'll just say it.</p>
            <p>"I feel warm and fuzzy things towards you and want to do something nice for you," Keltham murmurs, "even though I don't have anything specific in mind.&nbsp; Yes I realize that I've done some fairly nice things for you today already, my brain keeps feeling it anyways."</p>

            <p>"So, by this incredibly circuitous route, it is possible for an unverified story that somebody who is not me, fucked somebody else who is not me, to impinge on my own reputation for being competent or trustworthy at something."</p>
            <p>"This, I conjecture, is not even remotely what is going on in Golarion, not least because I get the implicit sense that the rumor was supposed to be damaging independently of the state of evidence behind it."&nbsp; He really needs to explain Law of Probability so these words will mean any things.</p>

            <p>"I can't figure out the steps after that.&nbsp; Now, I already realize that this is not going to be how it works in Golarion, but in the non-monogamy mating market of dath ilan, the number of men a woman is simultaneously dating is determined by her ero regeneration rate, how many times per month she wants to have sex, divided by the number of times per month she wants to have sex with any one man.&nbsp; The quality of the men she fucks would be mainly determined by her own desirability on the informal mating market, what qualities she has that are in high demand and low supply, that sort of thing.&nbsp; The main correlation pathway would be if more men wanted to heavily date a low-supply monogamous version of her, than to shallowly date a high-supply nonmonogamous version of her, in which case being nonmonogamous would lower her mating market value, but it's not obvious to me that this is how things work particularly."</p>
            <p>"Like, why can't you just have a woman with high standards who is herself desirable enough that she catches lots of people who meet her standards?&nbsp; See also, heiress to the Dark Unilateral Ruler and her harem of four men with different economicmagic powers.&nbsp; If you're number five you're probably pretty cool."</p>

            <p>" - do people on dath ilan think of themselves as having a specific number of times per month they want to have sex? - probably not the main point. Uh, on Golarion even if there's not a monogamy agreement it's some evidence you are dissatisfied with your existing relationships if you're shopping around, so it speaks somewhat negatively of your existing partners. Also, on Golarion, women are generally assumed to be - bottlenecked on people who meet their standards - so if they have a lot of sex, they probably have low standards. Though less applicable if one is rumored to be sleeping with the Queen in particular."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>- that's weird. "Contessa Lrilatha wrote, for Keltham, a contract obliging Cheliax to force me to have an abortion, if he gets me pregnant and I'm being difficult. A major step forward, which I'm very proud of, and which involved me signing whatever she wrote with about forty five seconds of reading, and I'm curious if I've also sold off my firstborn."</p>
