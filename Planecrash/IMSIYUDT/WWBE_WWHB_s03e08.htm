              <p>"This is a mission for big girls," he informs her.&nbsp; "You are not adequately prepared for it.&nbsp; You were intended as a welcoming gift for Keltham.&nbsp; Somehow you've ended up with a great deal more responsibility than that.&nbsp; This will require rapid retraining."</p>
              <p>"Pilar is now an oracle of Cayden Cailean.&nbsp; That's the Chaotic Good god of drunkenness, if you're too loyal to know.&nbsp; It happened moments before Pilar could sign her soul contract.&nbsp; Mindreading shows that Pilar didn't want that at all, and that her request to be Maledicted if she needs to be executed was completely sincere.&nbsp; This matches up with earlier records of Pilar's thoughts being read, and is not currently thought to be an oracular power for evading having her mind read.&nbsp; Orders are to consider her an Asmodean in good standing, <em>for now.</em>"</p>
              <p>"Her giving cake to Sevar was a manifestation of her oracular curse, as was her distribution of sweets."</p>
              <p>"You failed to report the former event for the entire length of the morning.&nbsp; Had Security <em>not</em> known about this matter already, and had the Security officer present also failed to take explicit note of the anomaly <em>as every one of you did</em>, your failure to note Pilar's unusual behavior and report it to anyone, would have meant ignoring signs of a <em>catastrophic</em> underlying problem."</p>
              <p>"You can have that toe healed at the end of the day, or earlier if Keltham suddenly wants to sleep with you for some reason.&nbsp; Meanwhile, it is expected to provide you with a recurring reminder of the new level of Security awareness that is now required from you."</p>
              <p>"Broom is here by direct authorization of the Grand High Priestess and belongs to a Lawful Neutral god whose work conduces to Asmodeus's purposes.&nbsp; He is not authorized to give you orders and you should show him neither deference nor disrespect."</p>
              <p>"Highpriest Maillol has decided that Sevar seems to have the best current understanding of Keltham of anyone present, including himself.&nbsp; In the unlikely event that you prove to understand Keltham even better, Maillol might put you in charge instead.&nbsp; Try sabotaging Sevar to make yourself look better by comparison and Maillol will hurt you enough to mildly improve your soul before sending it onward to Hell."</p>
              <p>"Asmodia earned a punishment the previous evening but is not currently considered by Security to be an ongoing problem."</p>
              <p>"You're done here.&nbsp; Put your shoe back on."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa would not even <em>consider</em> making comments about that. Fate is clearly already incredibly tempted around here, despite having as far as anyone knows been extinguished a century ago.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>'</p>
              <p>She puts her headband back on. It's nice how she's not going to have to take it off this time.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There's no arguing that the girls are all in over their heads. She's not...actually sure that Security and Maillol are less in over their heads. Contessa Lrilatha didn't seem in over her head and the Queen didn't seem in over her head and Aspexia Rugatonn didn't seem in over her head but everyone who isn't on that level ...might, in fact, be in over their heads.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Well, she always wanted to be that good.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It's pretty obvious with a headband on that having a headband on isn't anywhere sufficient to achieve that. She's not sure a +6 headband would be, and while Wisdom might be more useful than Cunning it doesn't solve the problem either. The fundamental thing is that they're trying to do something very hard with little margin for error and at least one god actively opposed to their efforts, and while obviously being smart is necessary for handling that.....</p>
              <p>...Nefreti Clepati isn't dath ilani. Being smart doesn't even mean automatically deriving all the&nbsp;<em>Law&nbsp;</em>and becoming one with it, within the range that humans are capable of making themselves smart. What she knows now is what dath ilan taught seven year olds in a couple days of classes, and while she can feel that it has not only cleared up her confusion about what bargaining is, that it has lit a torch that casts some light on a dozen surrounding things, she can mostly only see everything she doesn't yet know.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>But Keltham likes her. And if he gets bored in a week then the other girls will be a week more prepared for Keltham to like <em>them</em>. And while she tries to maintain realistic expectations about how long he's likely to take to get bored, her actual honest guess, now that she's smarter, now that it's a bit easier to split out which predictions are defensive-predictions so she won't be sad about whatever happens - what a <em>flaw&nbsp;</em>to have in your brain -</p>
              <p>- her actual honest guess is that he won't get bored in a week. That he'll pick up additional girls at some point, because variety is highly motivating, but that she's already not interchangeable, to him.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>For some reason this feeling makes her wish that she'd fixed the Queen's bag so it could hurt her again. However, not flirting with the Queen was the smartest call she made this morning and she's going to persist in it even if it would be really nice to be in a lot of pain. And she's not quite on terms with Keltham where she could run up to him and say 'for reasons I can't tell you, I want you to break all my knuckles with a hammer' - he's not even there yet, he wouldn't enjoy it -</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She gives herself five minutes to spend staring out the window and daydreaming about things to tell Keltham to seduce him to Evil, and then tries to steer her mind back on to business. ...it's probably too late to pull Asmodia aside in a not-maximally-threatening way but she'll see if she happens to be able to catch her.</p>

              <p>She's not bothering trying to walk without a limp if Keltham's not around.</p>
              <p>The food here is substantially better than in Ostenso academy.&nbsp; She's gone to get a small snack from the refectory area; they've got some out, probably in case Keltham - or, she supposes, maybe some of the other people here - want one.&nbsp; Nobody's told her she can't.</p>

"Keltham didn't, or this would be a very different conversation, and perhaps you will get it together by the time he's competent to read us at all, but I noticed.

You're not an idiot - you're very clever, actually, or this would <em>also </em>be a very different conversation - and we're the most carefully-corrected batch of wizards in all of Cheliax at present. But. We are working in adversarial conditions, here, Abadar is&nbsp;<em>mad at us,&nbsp;</em>and to succeed under those conditions our success needs to be assured from more than one direction. Cheliax is doing its Chelish best to teach you how to handle yourself here.</p>
              <p>And dath ilan, if we were dath ilani students, would try to bribe you. On the utterly stupid assumption, if Keltham's telling it straight, that punishment doesn't work; or on the slightly less stupid assumption, if we figure the smart people in charge of dath ilan lie to their people as much as our smart people lie to us - and I don't think Keltham'd be very surprised, to learn that - that sometimes you hit a different corner of the motivational system, when you dangle a bribe in front of someone."

            <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodia puts on the headband.&nbsp; She's ever tapped herself with a Fox's Cunning, but there's said to be a subtle difference from the headband.&nbsp; That with spellsilver to anchor a more carefully refined enchantment than a hung spell, it can be smoother, more supportive, befitting something meant to be worn forever after.</p>
              <p>...she can't really tell the difference, in the first rush of clarity, it feels half as intense as Fox's Cunning but otherwise mostly the same.</p>
              <p>Mostly her newfound clarity is agreeing with her prior impression that, yes, her life is a complete loss in which nothing good has happened to her, nothing good is ever going to happen to her, and all of her goals now consist of being tortured less and staying out of Hell for slightly longer.</p>
              <p>It's definitely possible that having any prospect of anything good ever happening to her would hit a different corner of her motivational system.&nbsp; Dath ilan could be on to something there.&nbsp; Asmodia chooses not to say this out loud, where it would be a pathetic plea for help; if Sevar is running Detect Thoughts, which would be sensible of her, then she's welcome to the inward thought that isn't a plea for anything.</p>
              <p>"Or, alternatively, we only got the lectures for seven-year-olds so far and dath ilan's reasoning will seem much more understandable after a full week of lectures," Asmodia chooses to say instead.&nbsp; "Irresistibly compelling, even, which I assume is why they had us sell our souls first."&nbsp; Why not Sevar, though, that makes no sense.&nbsp; "And Abadar's mad at us?&nbsp; That sounds important."</p>

              <p>Carissa knows exactly what Keltham will see if he turns Detect Anxieties on her, because it hasn't left her mind since the Queen said it and she's pretty sure it never will, even if she succeeds beyond everyone's wildest dreams and gets a duchy out of it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She doesn't say that. Obviously. But that leaves her - with absolutely nothing to say, nothing she can even really imagine herself saying. Her planned grateful exit was, 'I think I'll need the headband on to consider that', but she's not sure she can say that, about - about the desire&nbsp;<em>not to be -</em>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Then again - the other form of the thing she wants - isn't something that a lot of people want.&nbsp; Maybe it's genuinely easier to figure out what the Starstone does to the people it eats, than to figure out immortality.&nbsp; Though you'd think, if it was easy to solve, that Galt would use that instead of their famous soul-trapping executioner's blade, which Asmodia isn't interested in because the Hellknights will get to it sooner or later.</p>
              <p>"I suppose a slave's-bread version of that would be finding enough spells that destroy memories and rewrite personality that the person who goes to Hell isn't effectively me any more," Asmodia says, and feels a flare of awful hope as she does.&nbsp; "Remaking her to be a faithful Sarenrae worshipper might be funny, she'd be so <em>surprised</em> when she ends up in Hell."&nbsp; Because fuck Sarenrae, that's why.</p>

"I suppose I don't need to tell you this, Asmodia, but most&nbsp; people run into five kinds of heresy the first time they try having an original thought, and we presently have a problem that we can't solve without a fair bit of original thought. I'm not, of course, an exception, but I suspect that the five kinds of heresy I end up at are entirely different from yours.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I want you to think anyway. You can end all your thoughts in 'and this is why I want my soul expended for magical power by the darkest of sorcerers', if you want, I don't care, though do mind that your only route to that is to impress me. I want you to try to understand the math underlying Law well enough that if we end up sticking more headbands on you you can derive things dath ilan didn't get around to teaching Keltham. I want you to do well enough at that Keltham notices, ideally, but I actually think I care more about the math than the Keltham noticing, and if you hate the idea of him noticing you in particular you can feed all your clever mathematical insights to Meritxell."

              <p><br>Asmodia follows Sevar to her bedroom - not the first person to do that, apparently!&nbsp; But at the point where someone can nab Abrogail Thrune II while not looking any prettier than Carissa does, she is no longer a slut, she is a shapechanged ancient dragon slut with nine slut caster circles, and only a fool would anger someone who's as much of a slut as that.</p>
              <p><br>And along the way, while she's still wearing the intelligence headband, Asmodia asks herself what she understands about dath ilani <em>thinking.</em>&nbsp; There's obvious notions like, they've developed some inner thing like arcane sight that pierces through the Prime Material like a realm of shadows and sees Mathematics underneath it, but Keltham already knows that and isn't being shy about teaching it to them.&nbsp; Figuring out what they lied to Keltham about, filling in the holes of his knowledge - there's some parts that are obvious if you were raised Evil, what a perfected Lawful Good society carefully hides from children and citizens of questionable loyalty: sadism, the possibility that you can hit people to get them to do what you want, that you can force people to go on playing games they aren't being bribed to play.&nbsp; If Asmodia has an advantage in figuring out something like that, it will be the <em>math</em> that they censored from him.</p>
              <p>Is there any part of this that she has an elemental affinity for?&nbsp; The first day - wasn't an unhappy one, was as happy as any day in Cheliax ever gets, between the moments of anxiety and being sure that Keltham was fucking with them.&nbsp; They found out that it's possible to glance at a country of half men and half women, and pierce through the obscuring veil of matter to the Law behind.</p>
              <p>And the thought occurs to Asmodia, then - if she is, for some reason, allowed to think about dath ilani <em>thinking -</em> that there's something about Keltham's dath ilani attitude in the face of difficult problems that's - indomitable?&nbsp; Wrong word, and maybe Taldane doesn't have a right one.&nbsp; Something that isn't expecting that students only get problems that they've been trained to solve.&nbsp; Keltham does ask if Golarion has already tried and failed to solve problems, but only to know how difficult they'd be for him to solve, not to consider whether they might be impossible.&nbsp; You never get the impression for a fraction of a second that dath ilan itself would respect all of Golarion's past hard work as meaning anything.&nbsp; Why should they, when Golarion could stare at a country of half men and half women for millennia, bargain over shoes for millennia, and never see the towering structure of Law barely a step out of vision, that dath ilani seven-year-olds learn about from older boys?</p>
              <p>A lot of people in Golarion have tried to get immortality -</p>
              <p><small>(or get out of soul contracts)</small></p>
              <p>- but they weren't dath ilani.</p>
              <p>If nothing else, destroying a soul - if Abaddon, or the Starstone, can do that at all - or just putting a statue somewhere it will never, ever be reachable again even by the Hellknights or Hell - really <em>doesn't</em> seem like the sort of thing that a class of dath ilani children would give up on, if a teacher gave it to them as a puzzle they didn't know how to solve.</p>

It was changing shape all along, it was just less notable because there was still some available spell-building space. You can get better at scaffolding so you have space for more (and more powerful) spells. You can get another spellbook and build another scaffold, which will come out identical to the one you've currently got because the interactions that are shaping it are part of<em> you</em> not part of the spellbook.</p>

Is she being reassured because she's ....thought to be an unhelpful amount of scared? But telling her the Queen might come for her wouldn't seem to help with that! Is she being mocked? Probably; she's out of place here, in her Worldwound uniform, and well aware that nobles tend to think that kind of thing is funny. Is there a deeper, secret message? Why would it matter what Carissa thinks about what the Queen thinks of her? Is she being told that if she's a shape that the Queen will think of as flirting-back like it or not she should actually just flirt back? But it's too late! The woman acknowledged it was too late! Is it a test of whether she internalized Maillol's lesson about it not mattering what she wants? But even before that lesson she was very clear on the fact that if the Queen wants something you say yes, no matter what it is and no matter how you feel about it. What's this person's <em>angle?</em></p>

              <p>And if it fails, then&nbsp;<em>if she's lucky&nbsp;</em>she'll go to Hell.</p>
              <p>Asmodia could not possibly be less relatable; Carissa finds herself in fact utterly furious with her, for having the thing Carissa wants more than anything else in the world, and trying, like a toddler too caught in the throes of a tantrum to be reasoned with, to rid herself of it, the only inheritance she has, the only good thing about being human.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Carissa is not sure how much agency she is supposed to exert about the clothes-acquisition process but she figures more countesses' heirs err on the 'spoiled' side than on the 'meek' side so she tries to make demands, which go over fine; she wants fabrics that look like they'd be incredibly hard to do by machine, because they're labor-intensive and sufficiently non-repeating, since dath ilan will probably find those more impressive; a lot of laces are satisfactory on that front. She thinks that Keltham will be unamused by anything that takes an hour to lace up, so those are out.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She wants a dragonhide purse, because dath ilan won't have <em>that,&nbsp;</em>and she's tempted by necklaces that have tiny humanoid fae trapped inside them, pounding frantically at the crystal, but probably Keltham would get worried about them and ask if they want to be let out.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>....this is just occurring to her: do countesses' heirs who have a sadistic boyfriend have - she's not even sure what she's imagining - imaginative sex clothes of some kind. The obvious version would be, like, shirtsleeves that can lace together so as to bind your hands behind your back rather than lacing separately, or... maybe there's a particularly spiky kind of lingerie? Fabric is so expensive that Carissa thinks of this as a fairly ridiculous indulgence but now that she's thought of it it seems like someone would've, probably.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Because she is human and bad at the things humans are bad at, Carissa feels - what? distress at the thought they'll assume she's just like this as a person? Their opinion of her does not matter, and if she were just like this as a person then her life would be more convenient, and maybe she is just like this as a person, with the right handling which she just hasn't sought out.

            <div class='post-content'><p>Perversion 15:&nbsp; Ballroom clothing suitable for a Baroness, not quite at the Countess level; elaborate, but nothing that would overly impede a dagger-fight if you had to do that instead of dance.&nbsp; Cunning pleats and overlaps in the clothing would enable a lover to reach right through it for pleasure or punishment, in any number of various places and angles, without any need of removing it.</p>
              <p>Perversion 17:&nbsp; Loose slave garments and not-cripplingly-expensive-to-lose harem jewelry that would be suitable for a noble surrendering herself to a higher noble for sexual punishment after being defeated in a contest of wills and powers; according to a not-particularly-legible etiquette code that absolutely does distinguish this case from the case of a noble who got physically captured by another noble and forcibly redocorated by them, in which case, obviously, you'd be shopping at one of the other stores instead, because this store is only for noble submissives who are doing their own shopping.&nbsp; It's not considered gauche or mockery to wear this clothing even if you're not really surrendering yourself to a higher noble, and is instead a pleasing roleplay or flattery, which makes it much more popular than the primary use-case would suggest.</p>
              <details>
                <summary>Higher perversion levels spoilered</summary>
                <p>Perversion 18:&nbsp; A simply enchanted cursed belt which prevents you or anything you're wearing or holding from touching your own genitals, used for preventing self-stimulation.&nbsp; It won't stop a Mage Hand, but it's at least a little difficult to get yourself off with a Mage Hand.&nbsp; It won't stand up to a Dispel Magic and it doesn't have any indicators that would show a Dispel Magic had been used on it; that's more the sort of heavy-duty cursed equipment that a dominant would buy to use on a submissive.</p>
                <p>Perversion 18 (also):&nbsp; A whole-body outfit of leather straps, concealing nothing of importance, studded with solid metal rings any of which can be locked to any other.&nbsp; You'll need to also buy either these simple open-or-shut connectors, which you could just as easily manipulate to free yourself if your fingers weren't otherwise restrained, or these more time-consuming simple locks sharing a common key.&nbsp; You could be restrained and re-restrained in a very wide variety of positions using this, especially if you also buy these simply-enchanted adjustable-length metal bars with rings on either end.&nbsp; Uncaring use of this on you may require a cleric's attention afterwards, not that there's anything wrong with that.</p>
                <p>Perversion 20:&nbsp; An Asmodean fighter's leather armor, but interlaced through with subtle bands that can be tightened to reduce flexibility and resist motions, handicapping the wearer.&nbsp; If you were wearing this you could lose a hand-to-hand combat to a substantially less skilled fighter without it looking too unnatural.&nbsp; The groin protection can be detached without that affecting the restraining power of the rest of the armor.</p>
                <p>It's not that large a store floor, and even if Carissa keeps her focus relatively narrow, she's liable to notice, for example, a Perversion 24 enchanted metal bra whose breast cups go searingly hot any time you make a sound, a much more expensive Perversion 33 bra that sears you any time you disobey any order you hear, decorated aesthetic versions of many common torture implements that don't require overly expensive (for a noble) clerical attention afterwards, slave rags which sure look like ordinary slave rags except for somehow being four hundred times as expensive - oh, they're enchanted to automatically clean themselves without requiring some random laundry wizard to use Prestidigitation for two minutes, that's why they're four hundred times as expensive - and of course cuffs, whips, branding irons, acid droppers, and blindfolds with extraneous gold detailing and in some cases tiny rubies.</p>
              </details>
              <p>In many cases, one can tell on a close examination that this is definitely subwear that noble Asmodean submissives buy for themselves, rather than subwear for Asmodean dominants to buy for their subs; because the subwear is visibly designed in some way to allow or require the submissive to put herself into it, rather than for her to be restrained while somebody else puts subwear on her.&nbsp; (Obviously this is a matter of fashion signals rather than practice; it's not like you couldn't threaten somebody into putting this stuff on.)</p>
              <p>The male-focused section of the store floor is smaller, maybe a quarter of the size, but very much existent (for the benefit of that very very rare Asmodean who wanders into a store like this one and starts pondering anything to do with gender disparities).</p>

              </a>
            </div>
            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa has never really given a lot of thought to how the nobility lives, beyond deciding a decade ago she didn't want to be a court wizard because the mortality rate was appalling. Her plan was to start a magic shop, figure out who was the most important person to bribe, make them something beautiful every year for a present, and assume that sufficient to keep her out of everything else.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Her feeling now, looking at all of this, is - faintly infuriated? It seems very - fake - like they're playing the game of having sex, instead of just having sex like normal people. Carissa is not actually sure she is very interested in the game of having sex. She tends to have sex for advantage, which means that when she's having sex it's with people who have power over her, rather than people she has power over, but that's not a game, that's just how everyone's incentives are shaped. This is a game. The consequences are real but the thing itself doesn't seem any less fake, for that.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She understands, maybe, what Maillol was trying to tell her, that it wasn't all right for Keltham to have her because she said it was. That comes from the same world as this, a world where everything is a game, where someone might decide to put on these clothes and seduce someone just because it's fun, playing with the inevitable natural order of the universe but only that, playing.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa is pretty sure that her actual sexuality, which she unfortunately needs to keep track of because there's no time in her schedule at present to learn to fake it, doesn't resemble this. It is about belonging to someone with the power to do whatever they like with you, yes, but - it's not about belonging to them&nbsp;<em>because you're into that.&nbsp;</em>It's not about the fact power is sexy, it's just about power. It feels like a real distinction, at least inside her head. Insofar as it features clothes like this at all they were definitely picked for her by someone who likes her in them, not picked out herself.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Okay setting aside her actual sexuality, which being the product of a human mind is going to be stupid and incoherent, what does she want? Some of the fancy outfits that look like they definitely couldn't have been manufactured overnight as part of an elaborate effort to convince Keltham that masochism is a real thing, some things that look like they'd obviously only work with the cooperation of the wearer, some things for farther in project corrupt Keltham which don't as obviously only work with the cooperation of the wearer&nbsp; - she tries to model Keltham's reactions about magic chastity belts and Keltham in her head is making a face but not a 'no' face so she'll grab that -</p>
              <p>- she has a unhappy feeling that somehow looking at the more-dangerous stuff at all counts as flirting with Her Infernal Magistrix. Because everything counts as flirting with Her Infernal Magistrix, or at least everything done in the slightest awareness it might have effects on Her Infernal Magistrix. Anyway pushing Keltham too far too fast might make him decide to think too hard about the whole situation, so she won't get any of that. Yet.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"I think this is enough for now," she says, once she's picked out an outfit for ballroom dancing, which she does not do, while sexually accessible, which pants <em>work fine for,</em> and the magic chastity belt, "unless you're apprised of the whole situation enough to have opinions and advise otherwise."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>It's hard to figure out which possible responses to that potentially get her hand burned off in a way that non-government-employees don't get free healing for.&nbsp; She's <em>obviously</em> not apprised of the whole situation, which suggests that she definitely shouldn't say anything, but that's too obvious to be the meaning.</p>
              <p>"I have no experience or training in honeypot operations targeting unsuspecting Lawful Good targets.&nbsp; Government-approved literature has seemed to suggest that presenting yourself to a Lawful Good man in obviously self-applied bondage," gesturing at the outfit of leather straps, "will tempt him to do things to your helpless form, without that seeming to hurry him along the path to inflicting pain; and that tickling is useful as an intermediate step towards getting him to hurt you," gesturing at a shelf of tickling implements and lubricants labeled Perversion 3, "but I don't know if any of that's meant to be useful advice or a fictional conceit."</p>
              <p>Realistically shouldn't this be asked of a honeypot operator with experience targeting the boy's home country?&nbsp; But there's presumably some reason they aren't doing that and instead asking her and also aren't giving her any more information??&nbsp; Citing only government-approved advice is the only tactic she can think of for possibly getting out of this with mostly inexpensive injuries.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham asked questions about farming and other aspects of Chelish economics.&nbsp; Meritxell and Tonia mostly answered them, in a way that fits the hypothetical new Cheliax so far as Security could tell.</p>
              <p>Ione passed a note to Security offering to warn Keltham to maybe not trust everything Meritxell says about economics, because she might be overrunning her real knowledge - in a very enthusiastic and well-intentioned way, but still.&nbsp; Security is deferring that decision to Sevar.</p>
              <p>Ione oracled in one Ostenso library book about farmers - Security does still have the ability to redirect Keltham's thoughts away from text, and farming seemed innocuous.&nbsp; It didn't contain nearly as much direct detail on farming operations as Keltham had hoped; no illustrations of plows or mentions of how much a plow costs or who makes plows, and soon Keltham gave up and stopped reading.&nbsp; Keltham suggested establishing communications with somebody at the Ostenso library who could check through books first given a request for content, and leave a found book in a designated place for Ione to borrow.&nbsp; One Sending is an improvement over two teleports, or this potentially warrants a paired mirror.&nbsp; Security told him that Requisitions said she'd think about it; Requisitions in this case really means Sevar, they can get the mirrors if Sevar says yes.</p>
              <p>Asmodia has been keeping to her bedroom and rereading her math textbooks, which is overtly good behavior.&nbsp; She wasn't tightly monitored but spot-checking of thoughts suggests that she's anxiously locking down a lot of disloyal thoughts, nothing unusual for someone in her position though of course Asmodia isn't being told that, but certainly more anxiety and thought-suppression than would have been characteristic of her three days ago.&nbsp; Overt thoughts indicate willingness to work with Sevar on her mysterious project for dath ilani thinking, confusion about what the real purpose of that is, painful hope that maybe she can avoid Hell after all.</p>
              <p>Pilar was almost but not quite killed when a Security wizard got a message announcing one of his wives had successfully birthed a child, and Pilar shouted "Congratulations!" from directly behind him.&nbsp; Nobody including Pilar understands how Pilar got into the temple room where the wizard was receiving the message, and Pilar can't quite remember what she was doing just before that.&nbsp; Pilar thinks she could possibly learn to not do it to on-duty Security, so long as she can still do it sometimes to somebody, but on this occasion the impulse took her by surprise.&nbsp; Pilar is significantly shaken up about this, because if she'd died like that she wouldn't have been Maledicted first.&nbsp; Also, Pilar needs to throw somebody a larger party, preferably a surprise party; single pieces of cake being handed out on special occasions aren't going to cut it for her indefinitely.&nbsp; This is mostly Maillol's problem but is being copied to Sevar in case it somehow interacts with project matters, or for that matter in case she wants to advise Maillol that having a Chaotic Good oracle to exhibit to Keltham isn't worth that much.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Cayden Cailean is like the kind of god Carissa would have made up if she were a propagandist trying to convince Chelish people that Good is stunningly worthless and stupid. Probably it's fine if Pilar throws some parties, how expensive can that even be, though the only acceptable targets for surprise parties are the other girls and maybe whoever's on staff doing laundry or whatever. Coordination with the library in Ostenso seems straightforwardly good for the cause of passing Keltham only desired books, worth a mirror. If Tonia and Meritxell are the chattiest girls they should both get some training/screening for how to handle it if Keltham wants to fuck them.</p>

              <p>Well, obviously his god could be trying to protect him against internal-adversary enchantments too, from somebody who wasn't Carissa and probably not this security guard either??</p>
              <p>...Or his god could be telling him to go outside and spring a trap on purpose instead of waiting for it to go off???</p>
              <p>Keltham really wishes he had a much better sense of what was normal for Golarion.</p>

              <p>But there was a purpose of oracles of old.&nbsp; They cannot receive arbitrary messages from gods.&nbsp; They can receive presentiments, under negotiated conditions meant to ensure that those presentiments help to bring about Prophecy rather than avert it.</p>
              <p>Prophecy is shattered now, which is to say, depending on how you look at it -</p>
              <p>- Nethys now knows more than anyone else about how the future is otherwise destined to go, so, if anybody was supposed to still go around sending presentiments to oracles, it would be His job, wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>Nethys does have any options for conveying information to humans.&nbsp; They're just difficult and expensive and not the sort of thing that parts of Nethys can do on a whim, there has to be more power and unity behind it than Nethys usually tries to muster.&nbsp; Difficult, expensive, painful.&nbsp; It's rare for that much of Nethys to agree on anything.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>There's more to it than that, of course, Zon-Kuthon is not that easy to manipulate. &nbsp;Zon-Kuthon was somewhat on the fence about Nethys's strange request and stranger warning - He doesn't do what other gods want of Him, usually, but Nethys went more legible than was usual for Nethys and seemed to show knowledge about how the mortal, who admittedly looks rather strange, was likely to oppose Zon-Kuthon's own purposes and have the power to do that for some reason? &nbsp;That the mortal is in Cheliax is also not a good sign; Asmodeus is foremost among the gods who would actually choose to annihilate Zon-Kuthon and not just dislike Him. &nbsp;Zon-Kuthon ordered a strike team assembled, targeted, held ready, but has not given them the go sign.</p>
              <p>Zon-Kuthon is likewise aware that Otolmens is as wary of Him as of any god save Nethys. &nbsp;Dou-Bral once fought to seal Rovagug. &nbsp;Even if the expected balance of pain and pleasure and things that Zon-Kuthon now cares about, changed when Dou-Bral Himself changed to Zon-Kuthon and changed His expected effects on the world, one would expect Zon-Kuthon to be a lot closer to unleashing Rovagug than most other gods.</p>
              <p>The latest attempt at Otolmens telling Zon-Kuthon what not to do is sufficient to swing His decision, especially given that Zon-Kuthon does not expect to be caught.</p>
              <p>He orders the recipient of His vision to tell the team to attack immediately, and then to kill himself, without mentioning to anyone else that this was a fresh divine intervention rather than a previously given order.&nbsp; There's a closing opportunity window here, since if the strike team arrives fast enough, the belief of other gods should be that it was already in motion when the edict was laid.&nbsp; It's very unlikely anyone will see Him about it; any god trying to pay that much attention to all of Nidal would fragment themselves and drive themselves irrevocably mad.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Gorum, Chaotic Neutral god of battle, god of strength and weapons and soldiers, receives a message from a certain Someone who He is rather fonder of, than She is of Gorum.&nbsp; This is only to be expected, given that Her workings often conduce to His purposes; His workings, to Hers, not so much.<br><br></p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; She offers Him information, under the condition that She wishes it not revealed to other gods that She was the source of that information.<br><br></p>
              <p>Gorum accepts.&nbsp; He does not expect to be harmed by the mere reception of information however suspicious, He could always choose to ignore it and do nothing with it.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Zon-Kuthon is about to violate Otolmens's order in Pharasma's Name.&nbsp; If you look exactly here, you should be able to catch Him at it.</em></p>
              <p><br>Interesting.&nbsp; Yes, there it is.&nbsp;<em> What of it?&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon is not as opposed to My purpose as to those of others.</em></p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Zon-Kuthon has not much margin in His tolerance of the expected future state of Golarion.&nbsp; If nothing else is done about it, He is likely to attempt to release Rovagug during an upcoming major disruption to the world.</em></p>
              <p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; As much as You might have wished to use Zon-Kuthon as a counterbalance to Asmodeus, and have been among the foremost proponents of that, events have now been set in motion such that it is no longer safe to try to use Zon-Kuthon for that purpose.&nbsp; He cannot be allowed to remain as He is now.</em></p>
              <p><br>Part of the goddess speaking to Him goes legible; She is being truthful, though it is also clear that She is withholding much, for She does not likewise make legible that She is sharing all relevant information.</p>
              <p>Some of the shape of the connivance is becoming clear to Him.&nbsp; <em>Would this upcoming major disruption be any of Your own work, perhaps?</em></p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Perhaps.&nbsp; If it were, I would wish to conceal My hand and show it to few other gods, with this exception made to reduce the probability of a foreseeable outcome where the world ends up destroyed.</em></p>
              <p><br>Gorum knows He's being used, of course, but it does not offend Him as it might offend other gods; a soldier is a soldier whether they die for another's profit or their own.&nbsp; There is only one question He asks.&nbsp; <em>Will there be battle and bloodshed?</em></p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Deaths shall come faster than Golarion has seen in an age.</em></p>
              <p><br>Gorum will go along with this, then.</p>

              <p>Fights among high-level casters, in Golarion, don't last long.

An outnumbered wizard might have time to get a single spell off, or to empty the contents of their Bag of Holding onto the battlefield, or if they're well-trained to empty the contents of their Bag of Holding onto the battlefield while getting a single spell off, and then it's pretty much over, if they didn't pick that spell well.</p>

              <p>You'd think that dropping out of the sky on someone would hurt you as badly as them, which is not a good tradeoff when you're outnumbered, but 1) it's possible for even a random civilian to survive a fall from 60 feet if they let their legs break the fall, whereas it's less possible to survive the same force landing on your skull and 2) she has a healing spell almost finished as she lands, which means she's back on her feet faster, which means shortly after that it doesn't matter if the original injuries would've been fatal or not because Carissa can pull the sword out of Pilar's chest and stab him until they definitely are.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Cheliax has reinforcements teleporting in, by now, outside the Forbiddance. There are enough spells flying that all you can see are streaks of light and all you can hear are explosions and occasional screams.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Does this dead guy have, like, a dagger, in addition to the ridiculous ornamental sword, Carissa super does not have the strength to wield the sword effectively.</p>

              <p>He lands on top of the Kuthites about to attack Keltham without that significantly slowing his massive clawed feet from striking the ground.&nbsp; "Stay near me," he speaks in low rumbling Baseline, words that Carissa can probably recognize by now as dath ilani in intonation, even if she doesn't know the meaning.&nbsp; Then Gorthoklek begins speaking spellwords, and from him spring scorching rays, quickened fireballs, a meteor swarm.</p>

              <p>If such a thing is to be done, and it does appear it might be necessary, it should be done at once and unanimously, because a day of war Golarion can withstand, but a fight that would last any longer than that will flood the crops in the fields and destroy the people and, down the line, the kingdoms relying on them.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Iomedae has considered, long ago, how this could be done. At the time it did not seem wise, and She has been apprised little of whatever prompted so many gods to change their calculations, but here is how it would be done, if sufficient resources are committed to the doing.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And if it is to be done She should hold the key, obviously, as a Lawful god opposed to Asmodeus (let's be honest,&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>Lawful god opposed to Asmodeus), and one who can be predicted to release Him under conditions satisfactory to everyone else save Asmodeus, whose awful conduct is of course the reason they've even been pressed to this dilemma.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p><br>...there is <em>clearly </em>plotting going on here, gods are not stupid, Gorum did not come across this information by coincidence.</p>
              <p>That Nethys <em>could </em>have given it to Gorum is almost too obvious to need thinking; but you can't go around blaming Nethys for everything, that's a way to miss all the other possibilities that aren't "Nethys did it".&nbsp; Also, contributing information leading to the downfall of another god, even Zon-Kuthon, would be pretty daring for Nethys; other gods are <em>aware</em> that Nethys could do more than the usual damage if Nethys started acting deliberately against other gods, and while Nethys might be able to get away with moving against Zon-Kuthon, out of all the gods,&nbsp;<em>once,</em> He'd be walking very thin ice after that, if He were ever found out.</p>
              <p>A plot between Gorum and Asmodeus??&nbsp; Some weird accommodation between them???</p>
              <p>Gods' minds are large enough to explicitly consider many possible hypotheses.&nbsp; They will consider the possibility that it was Somebody Else who made an accommodation with Asmodeus, and then successfully persuaded Gorum to turn against Zon-Kuthon using this information.&nbsp; They will consider the possibility that Zon-Kuthon was lured into doing this and that is why Gorum knew where to look to collect the evidence.</p>
              <p>It doesn't change the fact that Zon-Kuthon did in fact deliberately violate a Pharasma's-Name edict from Otolmens.&nbsp; This is kind of a big deal for any god, let alone Zon-Kuthon, who maliciously withdrew His powers from the Star Towers that Dou-Bral used to impale and weaken Rovagug within Its prison.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodeus is confused, and dislikes it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Those are inadequate words for the experience of being Asmodeus; words are generally inadequate for it, but those ones especially so. All of Caina grows colder, as Asmodeus withdraws His power from Hell in order to think; few ever enter or leave Nessus, and there is no word of what is happening there.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It obviously serves Him, for Zon Kuthon to be warred with, and locked away; it's why He bothered to vaguely insinuate this might be warranted. And it does seem like Zon Kuthon might be more willing to war with Asmodeus - not even for any clear reason! - than previously imagined, which makes the case for being rid of Him stronger.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>But this was orchestrated, unambiguously, maybe by Nethys, maybe by several gods collaborating (Iomedae and Irori? Sarenrae and Abadar and Cayden Cailean, who has been <em>intervening in Cheliax&nbsp;</em>for some not-known reason? A minor god, gambling everything?) and it is hard to imagine that the end towards which it was orchestrated was simply the removal of Zon Kuthon.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There's lots of minor things that could be attained in the short term by distracting Asmodeus with a war with Zon Kuthon. Cheliax will be drawn into a war with Nidal. Ground might be lost at the Worldwound. Perhaps a difficult province in Cheliax could break free.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It seems unlikely that a god made a move with these stakes for that practically trivial prize.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Asmodeus is confused, and dislikes it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And yet, when confused, it's better to have more resources than fewer, and it's better for Zon Kuthon to be gone.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>He indicates willingness to back imprisonment of Zon Kuthon, with more resources if the key goes to Gorum. And He'd like Iomedae to note that absolutely none of the recent nonsense is his fault; he's intervened only when fully paid by other gods, to direct his people in not harming mortals They got suddenly attached to.</p>

              <p>At this point Abadar has <em>no idea what is going on</em>&nbsp;(lit: plenty of hypotheses and little evidence) but He wants Zon-Kuthon sealed up rather a lot; Abadar is the one who, long ago, bargained for Zon-Kuthon to go into a temporary imprisonment that should have lasted much longer than it did.</p>

              <p>Most gods, not all, combine their powers; the rest agree at least not to interfere.</p>
              <p>The forging of a vault begins, with a key that Iomedae alone can turn.</p>
              <p>Sarenrae temporarily focuses nearly all Her will on the vault where Rovagug is imprisoned, she could not protect that vault from a full assault by Zon-Kuthon from every direction, but with Zon-Kuthon otherwise distracted she will be able to fend off any lesser attempts at that, if it does not come as a surprise.&nbsp; There also does Otolmens stand guard.</p>
              <p>And most of the other gods of Golarion assault Zon-Kuthon, everywhere that is <em>not </em>that vault; Zon-Kuthon must put the greater parts of Himself within it, or else be vastly diminished.</p>
              <p>That Zon-Kuthon will scatter smaller-sized fragments of His will and power beyond the vault, yet linked to His greater whole, is inevitable; it is not easy to really,&nbsp;<em>really</em> kill a god, if they have not made themselves vulnerable by collecting themselves too much into one place.</p>

              <p>Asmodia was in her bedroom and got swarmed by shadows, after which some summoned monster or another gnawed off all of her legs below her mid-thighs; after Asmodia's body got retrieved, it was dumped in one corner of the library, for use in later Resurrection or Raise Dead + Regenerate.&nbsp; A dead Security wizard's body has been dropped beside her.</p>
              <p>Ione is unconscious, and would ordinarily have been evacced, but, library oracle; if she's got to be in some library that's not a triage center, it might as well be this library?&nbsp; Ione's body is occupying the largest, best-padded chair in the library, arranged with some detectable amount of respect, hands folded in her lap like a noblewoman.&nbsp; Things could have gone <em>much</em> worse without that brief warning to put up buffs and ready items. &nbsp;If Nidal had been able to lock down communications before they could call for reinforcements, or get assassins past the wards without triggering them, it could have been <em>much much</em> worse.</p>
              <p>The other girls are - reading, some of them; Paxti is talking too fast to somebody who's tolerating that; one of them is examining a spiky dagger with a gem-studded hilt, not in the manner of somebody who expects to keep it, but somebody who wants to take a good look at it before Security takes it away.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham is tempted at this point to poop out all this shit and tap himself with the Owl's Wisdom and to hell with personality integrity, shit just got visibly really serious instead of quietly really serious.&nbsp; He doesn't consider the thought for very long; the time to tap himself with Owl's Wisdom, if he hadn't been an idiot, was either the moment when the crisis started, or sometime before then.&nbsp; If it's not an emergency you don't take mind-altering performance drugs in the kind of state that Keltham is in right now.</p>
              <p>Were the two Auguries meant to indicate that this particular Augury was really important - that's plausibly - that's plausibly it, if he'd cast the second Augury then, and got a result of massive disaster from heading outside the Forbiddance, that would've - maybe that was what was meant to happen but how was Keltham supposed to <em>know</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>he'd thought it was one spell to figure out what the spell&nbsp;<em>was</em> and then the second one when he'd had time to think of a question -</p>
              <p>Not his fault, plausibly, in a way that makes sense to blame himself for; there's no obvious actually-general heuristic to update, here, that isn't just "use both Auguries on the first question to enter your mind".&nbsp; Keltham's god might not have been able to exactly predict -</p>
              <p>"I got two Auguries.&nbsp; I thought the first one was to find out what the spell was and the second one was for when I'd had time to think of the right question.&nbsp; If my god thought that three-quarters the first Augury wouldn't fail, but if it did fail, I would use the second one - or if people just always get two Auguries for redundancy - then maybe we weren't supposed to go outside, we were supposed to get a result showing disaster if we went outside and <em>that</em> would have tipped us off&nbsp;<em>without us going outside.</em>&nbsp; If that's true then my god is not a perfect predictor, they're not looking into the future, they're working off a fallible model.&nbsp; In that case they wouldn't have been able to do exact timing, and that attack was set to go off <em>the moment I went outside,</em> not because my god predicted the timing that precisely."</p>
              <p>"Similarly, when it comes to Zon-Kuthon, our two obvious hypotheses are, one, attack was building since yesterday, god warned us of it yesterday.&nbsp; Two, that spell was a warning of something else, I misinterpreted it as Zon-Kuthon, and somehow <em>that</em> triggered the attack by Zon-Kuthon, like by my thinking of him loudly enough that he heard it like a prayer, which does not seem particularly plausible to me but I'm saying it out loud anyways because Golarion."</p>
              <p>Or, of course, somebody in Governance heard him say it, and thought it would be a great thing to fake without the slightest use of subtlety.&nbsp; The light shows overhead - could have been locally faked to look global.&nbsp; Maybe Ione can grab a <em>newspaper</em> from Ostenso library and see if it mentions -</p>
              <p>Well, that might work if Ione is still Ione.</p>
              <p>"So.&nbsp; How did they know the moment I went outside."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>" - I don't know. Security cast - really cast, I'd have noticed if he did something weird - a bunch of standard detection spells, at the edge of the Forbiddance. There wasn't a scry up on the other side, or an alarm spell set to trip, or any magic at all, or anyone hidden and waiting - could've been someone's bonded familiar, a ways off, with vision enhanced to see through invisibility. Or could be Security was compromised, or Pilar, or me. Or you, I guess, if we're being thorough, though even then, they'd have had to have activated a magic item or something to alert people, and the others ought to have&nbsp;<em>noticed.&nbsp;</em></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><em>....</em>why was Pilar there. She isn't usually - when you test your spells - she wasn't when we did Detect Anxieties or Detect Desires -" Pilar had been checked and had totally satisfactory Anxieties and Desires but the plan had been not to have her mostly because there wasn't a good excuse&nbsp;<em>to&nbsp;</em>have her and not the other girls. Oh and now that Carissa thinks about it the reason Pilar was there was obviously 'some weird thing to do with her oracle powers' and she should not have completed that sentence aloud, though probably Keltham would himself have noticed the discrepancy, at some point...</p>

I don‚Äôt know how badly the villa is damaged, but I think it‚Äôll be in repairs for at least the next couple of weeks, and they might decide to relocate us to the Imperial palace - which is the only other place in Cheliax with a Forbiddance up, and which has security adequate for an invasion from anywhere I‚Äôve heard of.

            <div class='post-content'><p>Dath ilani - shouldn't be weak enough to need two weeks of recovery time after their first experience with somebody trying to kill them, should they?&nbsp; Though they certainly have a very, very different attitude towards violence than Cheliax.&nbsp; You learn the potential for defense in reality so that aggression stays confined to counterfactuals.&nbsp; Cheliax has public executions.</p>
              <p>Dath ilan has executions too, in a certain sense; if you intentionally cause someone else's True Death, you don't get kicked to the Last Resort, you get forcibly and preemptively cryosuspended.&nbsp; Not as a deterrent, obviously, because ideal agents ignore those, and Civilization doesn't build structures that would stop working if people became more ideal.&nbsp; Because anybody that dangerous is more danger than Civilization wants to inflict on the non-true-murderers in the Last Resort.&nbsp; Civilization has a motive to preemptively suspend people that dangerous irrespective of its effect on incentives; it's not a <em>threat</em>.</p>
              <p>Obviously if a Chronicler or a family member asked to be present at the preemptive suspension, and the murderer didn't veto it, Governance would hardly block them.&nbsp; You could probably do it as an ordinary concerned citizen and it's hard to see Governance stopping them without an overwhelmingly strong reason.&nbsp; Governance, which has way too much power to say 'no' to things, has to be very circumspect about what it actually says 'no' to, if it doesn't want the Annual Oops It's Time To Overthrow The Government Festival to suddenly turn real.</p>
              <p>Keltham has a suspicion that Cheliax's 'public executions' are not 'public' in the sense of 'open to sufficiently concerned citizens wanting to make sure everything has been done correctly'.&nbsp; It rhymes with Carissa's earlier claim that the thing to do with rats is feed them to other rats in a frenzy of cannibalistic death and sell tickets.&nbsp; Public executions, Keltham suspects, have tickets; though it's the sort of thing he should check later, maybe by asking Carissa what the equilibrium price of the tickets are rather than if the tickets exist at all, if he's feeling paranoid that minute.</p>
              <p>It's not like it's not consistent.&nbsp; It would pass muster as fiction.&nbsp; Low-tech society with poorer coordination, sustained by economicmagic, with healing, resurrections, and afterlives.&nbsp; Losing a finger isn't permanent until the distant Future can restore it; there are clerics.&nbsp; Not-true-death means you come back - well, you come back if you had enough money to buy insurance.&nbsp; Life in Golarion must be a pretty different experience for its relatively wealthy people and relatively poor ones!&nbsp; Like, <em>qualitatively&nbsp;</em>different, two worlds with different tech levels.&nbsp; But everyone gets the afterlife, it sounds like.&nbsp; Unless they betray an oath.&nbsp; Or Nethys touches them.&nbsp; Or how common is that statue business, he should check with somebody else, Carissa doesn't seem like the type to fret about Statistically Improbable Awful Fates.</p>
              <p>And, sure, you can imagine a society like that, where they don't give a shit about violence because the injuries aren't permanent.&nbsp; Where they don't give a shit about death because resurrection and afterlives.&nbsp; A society where people getting near the end of their natural healthspan, when they're starting to feel sick enough and stupid enough that they're not having fun, would have violent fights to the death with one another like that's a sporting event - actually maybe public executions <em>wouldn't</em> sell tickets, those are probably much more boring compared to suicide sports.&nbsp; So why <em>are </em>executions public?&nbsp; He'll try to remember to ask later.</p>
              <p>You could tell a consistent story where a dath ilani boy would be a fragile little flower by comparison to all that, and he'd take a long time to recover from somebody <em>almost</em> sticking him with a sword and instead sticking that sword into a girl he met two days ago.</p>
              <p>Keltham doesn't like this story, and he's trying to decide if that's his real self talking, or just his gendertrope.&nbsp; Well, his gendertrope <em>is</em> him to no trivial degree, he's at 10.2 out of 12 on the gendertrope identification scale.&nbsp; And it's not like zero optimization ever went into making the masculine gendertrope be a useful target for males to try to live up to.&nbsp; But still.</p>
              <p>But it's more that - Keltham has a sense that - there's something false about Cheliax's rejection of the idea that violence could be harmful.&nbsp; That it rhymes with Permanent Cheerfulness and Acting Like Sex Still Works Normally.&nbsp; The pain is still real, the suffering is still real, even if the injury and death are temporary and discarnation isn't the end.&nbsp; This is like - the sort of weird equilibria exhibited as stuff that might happen, if not for Civilization and not for mental training, hence why people have to go on playing strange games with children to let them be not that.&nbsp; A proving-things-to-people equilibrium like a duke's crazy son being challenged to prove his courage by racing a rhinoceros.&nbsp; Where people try to show off really hard how much injury and death don't matter to them, and end up dumping Asmodia's body in a corner without any respect shown to it while her soul's not in it.</p>
              <p>If dath ilan had healing and resurrections, it would not be like that.&nbsp; He doesn't think the Kelthamverse would be like it either.</p>
              <p>Or maybe he's wrong.&nbsp; He hasn't lived in the Kelthamverse plus healing, resurrection, and afterlives.</p>
              <p>But the fact that Chelish people still end up in shock for two weeks after their first fight with demons - suggests that their forcing their minds to be disdainful of violence's impact - doesn't quite work.&nbsp; Is possibly making things worse for them.</p>
              <p><br>"I want to&nbsp;<em>be</em> safe, not&nbsp;<em>feel</em> safer," is what Keltham says to Carissa when she gets back.&nbsp; "I don't think the foreseeable difference in the psychological impact of a semifamiliar place where an attack happened, versus a completely unfamiliar place somewhere else, is great enough to count against a 0.1% difference in actual securability.&nbsp; And - maybe this doesn't apply in this case, but - in dath ilan, if a mental shock isn't mostly better in the morning, and hasn't reached a new equilibrium after three days if it's not better in the morning, that would be the point at which you'd talk to somebody smarter or better-disciplined about mental errors you might be making that would cause internal conflicts to get stuck and not resolve.&nbsp; I won't push myself if it turns out I can't recover that fast, won't try to act outwardly normal if that's not true, but - it's the recovery timescale I would've guessed if you hadn't mentioned anything."</p>
              <p>"Oh, and I register with my amateur Security posturing that it seems to me that bringing Pilar back or contacting her early in the afterlife - to see if <em>she&nbsp;</em>has any idea how or <em>why</em> she was put there - is a Security issue higher than her ordinary resurrection priority."</p>

What a convenient preference from Keltham. "It'd be great if you're all right in a couple of days, some people are, and you can definitely talk to a priest about it if you want - and some of the ways people aren't all right might be irrelevant to you, like, people get flinchy in similar situations and that's a big liability if you have to hang out on the same wall fighting demons but much less of one if you never have to encounter a Kuthonite again."</p>
