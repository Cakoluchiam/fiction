That's great, because Carissa has decided the entire harem needs to read a bunch of Taldane romance novels so that if they can't stop themselves from thinking in romance novels they'll at least be whatever kind the King in <em>Taldor</em> has commissioned to develop appropriate attributes in Taldane young women.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>.... it turns out romance novels in Taldor are not commissioned by an Imperial office at all, which is itself the kind of useful thing you only learn by pretending to be Taldor.</p>

"<em>You</em> grew up after Hell took Cheliax to straighten us out and<em> you </em>got to read normal modern romance novels in which girls <em>win</em> the boy. Though none of the ones in which the girl wins the boy by cleverly getting all her romantic rivals' eyes gouged out, or in which the girl wins the boy by leaving him under the impression she's an important noble considering executing him unless he wins her over, and not <em>The Damnation of Sir Nicholau.&nbsp;</em>...actually I don't know what romance tropes the slightly gentler Cheliax we're going for has. ...maybe there's a version of The Damnation of Sir Nicholau where she's trying to teach him to enjoy himself, instead of having perfunctory sex he doesn't really like, and he goes to Hell once he realizes that he wants things for himself instead of only wanting whatever's best for other people, and in every disguise she's happy and fine because she, unlike him, has been raised competent to understand what she wants and to go get it."</p>

              <p>"Which, again, was basically the plotline of <em>Perverting Adan -</em>"</p>
              <p>"It's the plotline of <em>any</em> young adult novel with a female protagonist, who will, at some point, have to learn the darkness of her own desires," Ione snaps at Paxti.&nbsp; "As you'd know if you read more than one book a year -"</p>
              <p>"We can work with this, though," Paxti says.&nbsp; "Give me and Ione twenty minutes, and we'll come up with new plots for everyone's favorite romance books, with storylines that fit the new Cheliax."</p>
              <p>"I'll slit her throat before we get two minutes in," says Ione.&nbsp; Ione also sees a much bigger problem with that idea, but she's curious whether Sevar will spot it on her own.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>They're not going to have all that much time for it.&nbsp; Keltham may not be very trained to handle potential lies and gaslighting, but he was planning to be a Mad Investor, and hails from a vastly more financially sophisticated Civilization.&nbsp; He's not going to negotiate and compromise with Marta, and then sit down in front of an actual authorized negotiator who takes their final compromise as Keltham's starting point and negotiates a new set of moves in Cheliax's favor.</p>
              <p>This wouldn't usually happen in dath ilan - firstly because dath ilan would just seat both real negotiators directly, and second because the principles behind bargaining positions are better understood, such that they'd try to have bargaining outcomes be invariant to the order in which considerations are introduced.&nbsp; But dath ilan does have the concept of hiding an unusually high willingness-to-pay so that sellers can't price-discriminate against you, and sending in a 'negotiator' who doesn't actually have the power to make commitments is a standard known-failure-mode-to-avoid.</p>
              <p>Keltham will, of course say all this to Marta directly; none of that meta-information has any obvious rationale for keeping it secret.</p>
              <p>After that, he'll ask Marta more detailed questions about terms and conditions on Cheliax's starting offer, and more questions about the current size of Cheliax's economy, and what kind of measurement difficulties they expect to run into, and Governance's likely willingness-to-pay for various goods.&nbsp; But he won't <em>negotiate;</em> except insofar as offering his own starting remark that the offered percentages of generated value seem acceptable, if there's no gotchas in how profits or expenses are measured, and sufficient for quick agreement from there; but he wants to understand the terms and conditions before he says for sure that the starting offer is generous.</p>
              <p>At some point, Keltham thinks, he needs to give Cheliax a lecture on fairly dividing gains from trade <em>anyways.</em>&nbsp; If he can run through it quickly, he might as well do it today and see if that saves some time on negotiating.&nbsp; If they know that dath ilani approach fairness in a very structured way, maybe he can just tap himself with his own Truthspell and the Fair Division of Gains from Trade spell, say what the fair price would be, and have them accept that.</p>
              <p>Keltham wraps up with Marta - having hardly exhausted his unending sequence of Additional Questions, of course, but that's just what life is like for your first few weeks in another dimension - and heads over to the library.</p>

              <p>"Never mind.&nbsp; For a start, today, I'm going to try to quickly review the way that dath ilani learn about negotiation -"</p>
              <p>"Or actually no, before that, there's a test I realized yesterday I should run.&nbsp; Before things go much... further." &nbsp;Keltham is a little worried about where exactly he is inside reality, right now.&nbsp; It's probably just a silly worry.&nbsp; But yesterday with Carissa, he thought of an obvious possible way to check on it quickly, if everyone here is honest. &nbsp;It might not work, but then, it might.<br><br></p>
              <p>Keltham grabs a couple of the improvised markers from yesterday, and goes to the section of wall that was being used as an improvised whiteboard (with erasure via Prestidigitation).</p>
              <p>Keltham first shows how to use Unanchored Scales, an experimental elicitation tool for when you just want somebody's intuitive strength of feeling about something, without them worrying exactly about what any numbers mean.&nbsp; Draw a line with two endpoints representing 'not at all' and 'all the way', and then you draw a slash through the line at the point that corresponds to your intuitive strength of feeling.&nbsp; You could use it to ask 'How warm is this room?' without people bugging you about how warm a '3' was supposed to represent.&nbsp; It's not perfect, obviously, but the point is that the elicitation method acknowledges that imperfection up front.</p>
              <p>Keltham then asks everybody in the classroom, including Carissa, to answer two questions, separately, anonymously, on bits of paper to fold up and mix before he looks at them.&nbsp; Obviously, they shouldn't consult with each other at all before answering.&nbsp; Obviously, Keltham promises to make no effort to figure out who wrote down what.&nbsp; He really does want them to write down an honest answer, though, if they write down anything at all; they can draw an X-cross on the paper if they want to openly refuse to answer.</p>
              <p><br>The two questions Keltham writes on the whiteboard are:</p>
              <p>"How much do you have an unusual interestingly-complicated backstory or current problem, that I'd find out about if I got into a relationship with you?"</p>
              <p>"What do you expect will be the average answer of everyone here to the previous question?"</p>

              <p>Well, 'Keltham' would be the paying player of the original LARP, so...&nbsp; "I think what we're looking for is the expected degree to which I, a dath ilani, would say something like, 'Wait what?' after I found out.&nbsp; So the fact that you spent years at the Worldwound would be, like, a third of the way across, because it's surprising to me and matters to me, while you being secretly a dragon shapechanged into a human, if you knew I'd find that out later in the relationship, would be more like two-thirds across.&nbsp; Maybe let's say it's only past the halfway point if you'd expect <em>other</em> people here to be surprised."</p>

              <p>Meritxell would like to be a shapedchanged dragon! Or have a fascinating tragic backstory or something! Those feel like the way to be the best at this and she'd like to be the best at this. She's pretty sure if she'd had, like, a month's warning she could have had the best sexual fetishes, too, but that's hard to do from a cold start. She reluctantly marks down that she's not very interesting, which is incredibly painful to do, and that the average person is probably slightly more interesting than that, which is agonizing.</p>

              <p>Hopefully they'll get a good distribution of claims of interestingness so that any given girl can pretend later to have assigned a different one than she in fact did, but they can't coordinate, and it's hard to guess what other people will say.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"My shirt is a one-of-a-kind relic from another plane; it has no standard market price.&nbsp; In real life, I plan to never sell it, ever, though I might sell the ability to do science to it.&nbsp; Suppose however that, relative to how wealthy I expect to someday be, my shirt, one of my only memories of dath ilan, is worth one million gold pieces to me.&nbsp; In the sense that, if some insidious force was otherwise going to steal my shirt from me, I wouldn't pay any more than a million to protect it."</p>
              <p>"Now suppose somebody else has a very weird magical spell that can take any relic of dath ilan, and immediately convert it into ten million gold pieces, no questions asked."</p>
              <p>"Any price greater than a million gold and less than ten million gold is a&nbsp;<em>mutually beneficial</em> trade, in the sense that both of us are better off making the trade at that price, than not trading with each other at all.&nbsp; But if my shirt sells for only a million and a thousand gold, I'm only a thousand gold better off, and the other person is around nine million gold better off.&nbsp; If my shirt sells for ten million minus a thousand, the other guy has profited by a thousand and I've profited by a bit less than nine million."</p>
              <p>"Trading at all, at any price in the range, is mutually beneficial; we're both better off.&nbsp; But on top of that event, there's another event, a question of the exact price, in which my being one gold piece better off makes the other person one gold piece worse off."</p>
              <p>"How do we set that price, then?&nbsp; Aren't we locked into an adversarial game where it's my interest to say, 'I'll only sell at ten million minus one', and it's their interest to say, 'I'll only buy at one million plus one'?&nbsp; Why would we say anything else, when saying anything else just makes the other person better off at our own expense?&nbsp; But if we both think like that, the trade doesn't occur at all."</p>
              <p>"What price is fair?&nbsp; Or to put it another way, how can two people like that agree on a trade at all?&nbsp; How does Golarion, how does Cheliax, think about that?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>It hasn't come up in their books about Taldor yet but Carissa's met Taldane adventurers and in fact tried to trade them things and the answer is the same there as in Cheliax. "You barter. You say 'why, I don't see why I should give up this shirt for a coin less than twenty million gold, which communicates 'I'm open to negotiating a trade but would need to be persuaded it's the best trade I can get', and the other person says 'twenty million! I have a hard time believing even such a sentimental item is worth more to you than an entire week of Nefreti Clepati's time during which she could make a dozen duplicates of the shirt and make you a personal demiplane besides, and that would only be <em>eight&nbsp;</em>million gold. And really it seems to me like this trade is worth your time even for one duplicate of the shirt and the personal demiplane, and that would be only eight hundred thousand gold, which is what I'm offering. Which communicates 'I'm open to negotiating a trade but would need to be persuaded it's the best trade <em>I&nbsp;</em>can get'.</p>
              <p>And you say 'my, imagine what Nefreti Clepati would say if you tried to lowball her prices like that! I'm not sure this conversation is worth my time, if my shirt is worth so little to you.' Which communicates - and you might be bluffing, you're allowed to bluff when you're doing this - that the quoted price is well outside the range that's worth it to you, and they'd better indicate that they think there's overlap between their willingness to pay and your willingness to sell.</p>
              <p>And you iterate on this and then end up settling somewhere, the exact place depending on how competent at bartering you are and on the range of trades you both like."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Consider - as a dath ilani might consider it - the problem of a dath ilani cast into a strange new universe, who must trade with the aliens found there.</p>
              <p>(It is in fact quite a common trope, in dath ilani science fiction.&nbsp; But it wouldn't particularly occur to Keltham to classify this situation as that trope. &nbsp;Cheliax is <em>way </em>too legible. &nbsp;They have a currency of 'gold pieces' that they cheerfully translated for him into unskilled-labor-years. &nbsp;Golarion would need to be a <em>lot </em>weirder before it was good Trade With Aliens science fiction.)</p>
              <p>The aliens, one may suppose, have a biological-evolutionary setup similar enough to dath ilan's that they have epidemics, caused by viruses and bacteria and parasites.&nbsp; Suppose the aliens don't know about viruses and bacteria and parasites; or vaccines or antibiotics or filtering masks or possibly even sterilization.&nbsp; Nor about how one should use experiments to determine whether a disease is airborne or waterborne or touch-transmitted or transmitted through wastewater contamination or is carried by smaller or larger animals.</p>
              <p>The dath ilani, then, knows something which this alien Civilization might find of great value.&nbsp; The alien Civilization can perhaps pay for this knowledge, with some alien means of payment.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the alien Civilization, being nonhuman (or just non-dath-ilani) tries to be stingy about it; to lowball the dath ilani; to buy their knowledge at a cost of, say, a pile of shiny metal, or title to one island in the ocean.&nbsp; Depending on the exact backstory of how the aliens came to try this, and whether it was in some sense the fault of that whole civilization or just a part of it, even a non-Keltham dath ilani might well say, "Screw you, pay me."</p>
              <p>That, too, the dath ilani are taught; in Golarion terms, the difference between Lawful Good and Lawful Stupid.</p>
              <p>But then how high does the price need to be, exactly, for the dath ilani to agree to the trade?&nbsp; By what system do you determine an answer to that?</p>

              <p>In turn, the notion of 'fair trade' relies on understanding the notion of trade in the first place.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>'Jellychips', a staple of dath ilani lessons to young children, are small lumps of edible flavored gel.&nbsp; Jellychips come in distinct appearances, colors, shapes, and flavors; almost always, everything with exactly the same appearance has exactly the same flavor.&nbsp; Ten jellychips might mass as much as one peanut; they're meant to implement a burst of tasty flavor that's just enough to be present and pleasant.&nbsp; They're tiny so that children don't get end up getting all of their calories from economics lessons.</p>
              <p>To teach the notion of trade, you begin by passing out jellychips to children, and let them experiment a bit to find out which of their favorite flavors have which external appearance.&nbsp; Then ask the children to write down which flavors they like more or less than others.&nbsp; Compare the lists; observe to the children that they tend to like different flavors more or best.&nbsp; (There is in fact a jellychip selection algorithm, based on previously observed food preferences among the kids, which makes sure that this happens.)&nbsp; Observe to them that, by trading jellychips with each other, they could all end up with more of the kind of jellychips they want.</p>
              <p>Let them trade, a bit, as they desire.&nbsp; So long as they <em>haven't</em> been introduced to any formal concepts of 'fairness' to complain about, this part usually does not go too poorly, among dath ilani children.&nbsp; They'll find jellychips that they have, and don't want; and look for somebody else who wants those, and has some they want; and trade 1-for-1.&nbsp; If you let them play longer they'll start to notice triangular trades that no two children can complete, and do those too, but still usually 1-for-1.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>When the first rush of trading has died down, introduce to the children the concept of a multi-agent optimal arrangement: an arrangement such that it's not possible to redistribute the jellychips in any way that leaves all of the children better off simultaneously.&nbsp; Ask them if they think their current arrangement got there.</p>
              <p>Now the kids have a concept of a <em>social</em> goal to aim for, a way in which they can be&nbsp;<em>collectively</em> winning at trade or performing subpar; and the arguments will become a bit more heated.</p>
              <p>(Especially if you've sorted all the kids to have a certain sort of personality, and usually therefore all be boys; because sometimes different children learn different things, and some of those things are best learned by similar children all together.)</p>
              <p>It usually doesn't take long for one boy to start telling another that they <em>need</em> to make a trade, in order to get the classroom* into what they've figured as the optimal arrangement.</p>
              <p>Of course the older kids immediately step in at this point, and remind everyone that, by the definition of multi-agent-optimality, you should never need to <em>force</em> somebody to trade in order to get to a jellychip arrangement that's <em>better for everyone;</em> the target state should be better for the person who's making the trade too.</p>
              <p><br>(*) &nbsp;Not actually a 'room' in the sense of being indoors; children need to be exposed to outdoor light levels in childhood in order to not grow up nearsighted. &nbsp;The surface area required for children to spend enough of their day outdoors is currently the limiting factor on the urban density of the Great City (called also Central City and Default). &nbsp;This is one of the places where public will and private incentives are in conflict, since there's a pressure towards ever-greater urban density in the center; but if this were permitted, soon it would be mostly childless people who could afford to live in Civilization's dense center.&nbsp; For that and other reasons, it's been decided that it's better to limit the Great City's density and keep Civilization more spread out. &nbsp;To find a solid expanse of skyscrapers, you'd need to visit a major city with few or no children per capita, like Big Quiet, or Erotown.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>After this enlightenment, an adult Watcher comes forth, and argues to the younger children that the whole point of trading things is that different people put different values on the same goods: if you-1 like black jellychips and have blue jellychips, and you-2 have black jellychips and like blue jellychips, then you can both do better by trading jellychips with each other.</p>
              <p>This, the Watcher argues&nbsp;solemnly, is the point of trade, and the whole reason why people trade with each other: because they get different enjoyments from owning the same things, so that they can both become better off by passing the same fixed goods back and forth between themselves.</p>
              <p>The younger children are asked if they first-order believe that.</p>
              <p>None will say 'yes', at that point.&nbsp; The most overeager ones will say 'No!' but then be unable to explain why not.&nbsp; Most kids will give the brief Baseline comeback that colloquially translates to 'I probably would have believed it, if I wasn't pretty sure you were trolling me, though I haven't seen anything that I suspect is the real argument against it'.</p>
              <p>(A dath ilani childhood tends to make one grow up suspicious of things that grownups say with great solemnity.&nbsp; Civilization considers this a desirable outcome, which is good, because it sure is the outcome they're getting.)</p>
              <p>Regardless of their answers, the children are then <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6KzFwcDy7hsCkzJKY/the-point-of-trade">asked whether people who all got the same enjoyments from the same goods would never trade with each other</a>.&nbsp; And so that pathway of learning continues.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>On a separate track through the lattice of knowledge, a new idea may now be introduced on those foundations, the notion of a <em>fair trade</em> between black jellychips and blue jellychips.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It begins by showing the children a way to rearrange their understanding of jellychip preferences, as a quantitative relation and not just an ordering, through the concept of <em>indifferences</em>, which state equalities of preference.&nbsp; Not just, "I like purple jellychips more than black jellychips, and black jellychips more than blue jellychips" but "I am <em>indifferent</em> between having 5 purple jellychips, or 6 black jellychips, or 8 blue jellychips."</p>
              <p>But then, of course, you might be able to execute multi-agent-beneficial trades that&nbsp;<em>aren't 1-to-1.</em>&nbsp; If someone is indifferent between having 6 black jellychips and 8 blue jellychips, then trading <em>7</em> blue jellychips for 6 black jellychips will leave them better off than before.&nbsp; Right?</p>
              <p>A lot of children will say 'No!' at this point, and try to find some reason why that couldn't possibly be valid, because they know how economics lessons work, by this point in their lives.&nbsp; They expect that somebody's about to lead them down a pathway that takes them down to 6 black jellychips and then 5 purple jellychips and so on until they only have one jellychip left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>But you can, with a bit more work, convince them that it's totally valid to&nbsp;<em>want</em> 6 black jellychips more than 7 blue jellychips, and valid to trade things according to your wants, and tell them that in fact this does <em>not </em>necessarily always expose them to a set of clever trades that take them down to 1 jellychip which, it will then be proven to them, they must want to trade for nothing.&nbsp; That's not actually going to happen!&nbsp; You're thinking it's going to be the point of the economics lesson, but it's not!&nbsp; Adults actually trade 7 hours of labor for 6 fancy shirts all the time, without ending up with 0 shirts, and this is isomorphic.</p>
              <p>The children are then asked if they think they can get to a more multi-agent-optimal state by trading&nbsp;<em>uneven numbers of jellychips</em> amongst themselves.</p>
              <p>The children approach this warily; or with a burst of initial enthusiasm that fades, after many children prove rather suspicious of attempts to get them to trade more jellychips for less jellychips.</p>
              <p>Dath ilan having an average Intelligence of 16 or 17, it doesn't take long for somebody to point out that, even if one person likes some jellychips more than others, that's no reason for them to end up with <em>less jellychips.</em>&nbsp; Other kids also like some jellychips more than others.&nbsp; Why shouldn't&nbsp;<em>they</em> be the one to end up with less jellychips, and I, be the one who ends up with more, if that's how we're going to play it?</p>
              <p>Why yes, Keltham <em>was </em>the first one to say it in those terms, in his own class, when he was very young.</p>

              <p>Then for Keltham to trade his 12 blue jellychips, for 10 black jellychips from Limyar, would leave them both better off.</p>

              <p>And for Keltham to trade his 12 blue jellychips for Limyar's 12 black jellychips would leave them both better off.</p>

              <p>If you're the sort who agrees to just&nbsp;<em>any</em> trade that's mutually beneficial - like Limyar, in this classroom, had been earlier arguing people ought to do - then you know what Keltham is going to do to you?</p>
              <p>That's right.&nbsp; Keltham is going to offer 9 blue jellychips for your 12 black jellychips, you're going to accept, Keltham is going to carry out the trade, and then Keltham is going to angrily throw another 3 blue jellychips at you and yell that you're being stupid.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>If you step out and look at that problem from a wider angle, it's pretty much the same issue that holds between the dath ilani and the alien civilization, considering the price of medical knowledge.</p>
              <p>If the alien civilization offers some tiny lowball offer - like, say, a supply of food and water - in exchange for every last scrap of your knowledge, and there's no other civilization around to trade with, you and they will both be better off if you accept, compared to if you don't.</p>
              <p>But if you accept offers like that one, food and water is the most you can expect to be offered, if the aliens are less Lawful Neutral than Keltham.</p>
              <p>(Even if there's two alien factions around to trade with, you can't quite rely on them bidding against each other.&nbsp; What if they coordinate with each other instead?&nbsp; There's a noticeable amount for both of them to gain, if they both agree to offer you only food and water, instead of a higher price.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Another game is now introduced to the children, played with a single flavor of jellychip.&nbsp; It is not, in dath ilan, called the 'Ultimatum Game', but the actual name they have for it is the 'Final Trade Offer Game', which isn't all that different.</p>
              <p>One child gets a dial, with settings from 0 to 12.&nbsp; Another child gets a button.&nbsp; The first child picks a setting on the dial and locks it in.&nbsp; The second child then chooses whether to press the button.&nbsp; If the second child presses the button, the first child gets as many jellychips as the dial indicates; the second child gets jellychips equal to 12 minus the number on the dial.&nbsp; If the second child doesn't press the button, they both get nothing.</p>
              <p>Which is to say: the first child proposes a division of a gain of 12 jellychips, where they get some part, and the other child gets the rest.&nbsp; The second child can approve the division, or refuse it; and if they refuse, both get nothing.</p>
              <p>If you run this lesson on dath ilani children, virtually everyone offers a 6:6 jellychip split and everyone accepts it.</p>
              <p>At least, that's what they do on round zero, the initial round where they try things the simple way to verify their starting assumptions.&nbsp; Then they start experimenting.&nbsp; It's not so much that they're being selfish, and trying to figure out what they can get away with; it's that they're figuring there must be <em>some</em> clever point to this game, and you're not going to find it if you just offer 6:6 every time.</p>
              <p>Some kids try out accepting splits of 7:5.&nbsp; Other kids are like, ok then, and offer them 7:5 splits, which usually get rejected if, like, people are going to make a <em>thing</em> out of that, right.&nbsp; Some try offering compacts to trade 7:5 splits for 5:7 splits, but there's no guarantee that any two kids will be matched up again in the future.</p>
              <p>At this point the older kids step in and say that the point of the game is drifting away from the reality it's intended to model, and everybody nods and waits for the next part.&nbsp; (Of course there's a next part.&nbsp; There's been a weird game and no stunning insight about it has been presented yet.&nbsp; They've ever been to a lesson before.&nbsp; Older people aren't going to make you execute a weird pointless procedure and then <em>not</em> have some stunning insight to offer you as payment; kids would stop going to lessons, if that bargain was often violated.)</p>
              <p>Before the next part, though, the older child teaching asks what the kids think is probably the <em>ideal</em> or&nbsp;<em>correct</em> thing you're supposed to do if somebody offers you a 7:5 split, not as a game, but in real life.</p>
              <p>Keltham, of course, said to reject the offer.&nbsp; Some other kids agreed the offer should be rejected.&nbsp; Some claimed that you should accept it, but everyone should be angry at the person and whoever went next with them should offer them 7:5.&nbsp; Limyar claimed that you should always accept it, even if the other person offers 11:1, because <em>everyone </em>would end up with fewer jellychips if you rejected than if you accepted, so rejecting the offer couldn't be multi-agent-optimal.&nbsp; Keltham asked Limyar if he actually believed that.&nbsp; Limyar said no but he was going to go on saying it anyways to annoy Keltham.</p>
              <p>The kids argue about it for a while, and then the demonstration moves on.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>The next stage involves a complicated dynamic-puzzle with two stations, that requires two players working simultaneously to solve.&nbsp; After it's been solved, one player locks in a number on a 0-12 dial, the other player may press a button, and the puzzle station spits out jellychips thus divided.</p>
              <p>The gotcha is, the 2-player puzzle-game isn't always of equal difficulty for both players.&nbsp; Sometimes, one of them needs to work a lot harder than the other.</p>
              <p>Now things start to heat up.&nbsp; There's an obvious notion that if one player worked harder than the other, they should get more jellychips.&nbsp; But how much more?&nbsp; Can you quantify how hard the players are working, and split the jellychips in proportion to that?&nbsp; The game obviously seems to be pointing in the direction of quantifying how hard the players are working, relative to each other, but there's no obvious way to do that.</p>
              <p>Somebody proposes that each player say, on a scale of 0 to 12, how hard they felt like they worked, and then the jellychips should be divided in whatever ratio is nearest to that ratio.</p>
              <p>The solution relies on people being honest.&nbsp; This is, perhaps, less of a looming unsolvable problem for dath ilani children than for adults in Golarion.</p>
              <p>Once this solution is produced and tried once, the older children congratulate the kids on having solved the first layer.&nbsp; On to the second layer!</p>
              <p>In the second layer, some children get handed sealed cards before each game, telling them whether to be honest about it, or to try to grab a little more for themselves.&nbsp; (Though remember, say the older children, that this is all only a game; we are trying to ask how Civilization can be robust to bad people, not teach you to be bad people yourselves; the thing is, you see, that on scales much larger than this class, there really <em>will</em> be some bad people.)</p>
              <p>And that means the child who sets the dial, or the child who presses the button, can't trust the other to be honest.&nbsp; Even if the other child's sealed card didn't say to be dishonest, the first child has no way of knowing that.</p>
              <p>(Dishonest people really do complicate things, don't they?&nbsp; Just the fact that they exist makes things harder on everyone else, because they don't know who the dishonest people are.&nbsp; But that's part of the difficulty of constructing an adult Civilization, one that has to scale to numbers beyond two dozen or sixteen gross.)</p>

              <p>Keltham plays through with as much cold and steely determination as a seven-year-old can muster, offering exactly what he thinks is fair, rejecting anything he thinks is less than fair; feeling awful when the other kid yells at him that he <em>was</em> being honest, but not swerving from his course.&nbsp; He can trust himself; he cannot trust the other.&nbsp; When his card tells him to be dishonest, Keltham gives ridiculously huge estimates for his own labor, and hopes the other child is wise enough to know that Keltham is, must be, lying.&nbsp; Sometimes he's told to be dishonest and he has to pick the split himself, and then he gives a huge estimate and pretends he believed the other kid's huge estimate.&nbsp; Sometimes the other kid doesn't catch on in time, and then Keltham has to offer an unfair split or tap out of the game and metagame entirely, which feels like failing even more.&nbsp; Sometimes the unfair split gets rejected, and sometimes it gets accepted, which is worse.&nbsp; Keltham sets aside all his unearned chips to redistribute after the lesson ends.&nbsp; It's a good thing this is only a game, because living life like this would be awful.</p>
              <p>Lessons end for the day.&nbsp; It is sometimes good to let children dwell for a time on problems that don't have known solutions yet, or realize how awful life can become when not everyone has deduced the governing Law.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>When the children return the next day, the older children tell them the correct solution to the original Ultimatum Game.</p>
              <p>It goes like this:</p>
              <p>When somebody offers you a 7:5 split, instead of the 6:6 split that would be fair, you should accept their offer with slightly less than 6/7 probability.&nbsp; Their expected value from offering you 7:5, in this case, is 7 * slightly less than 6/7, or slightly less than 6.&nbsp; This ensures they can't do any better by offering you an unfair split; but neither do you try to destroy all their expected value in retaliation.&nbsp; It could be an honest mistake, especially if the real situation is any more complicated than the original Ultimatum Game.</p>
              <p>If they offer you 8:4, accept with probability slightly-more-less than 6/8, so they do even worse in their own expectation by offering you 8:4 than 7:5.</p>
              <p>It's not about retaliating harder, the harder they hit you with an unfair price - that point gets hammered in pretty hard to the kids, a Watcher steps in to repeat it.&nbsp; This setup isn't about retaliation, it's about what both sides have to do, to turn the problem of dividing the gains, into a matter of <em>fairness;</em> to create the incentive setup whereby both sides don't expect to do any better by distorting their own estimate of what is 'fair'.</p>
              <p>They play the 2-station video games again.&nbsp; There's less anger and shouting this time.&nbsp; Sometimes, somebody rolls a continuous-die and then rejects somebody's offer, but whoever gets rejected knows that they're not being&nbsp;<em>punished.</em>&nbsp; Everybody is just following the Algorithm.&nbsp; Your notion of fairness didn't match their notion of fairness, and they did what the Algorithm says to do in that case, but they know you didn't mean anything by it, because they know you know they're following the Algorithm, so they know you know you don't have any incentive to distort your own estimate of what's fair, so they know you weren't trying to get away with anything, and you know they know that, and you know they're not trying to punish you.&nbsp; You can already foresee the part where you're going to be asked to play this game for longer, until fewer offers get rejected, as people learn to converge on a shared idea of what is fair.</p>
              <p>Sometimes you offer the other kid an extra jellychip, when you're not sure yourself, to make sure they don't reject you.&nbsp; Sometimes they accept your offer and then toss a jellychip back to you, because they think you offered more than was fair.&nbsp; It's not how the game would be played between dath ilan and true aliens, but it's often how the game is played in real life.&nbsp; In dath ilan, that is.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>After that came the part where Keltham's learning-group was introduced to their first <em>sophisticated </em>trading-game, with tokens that produced varying quantities of jellychips, but only when held in proximity to other tokens, and large enough groups of tokens could produce more tokens.</p>
              <p>Despite their best efforts and the lesson they'd just learned - and, since they were still young boys, after a lot of shouting, beyond a certain point - the nascent market had soon shut down almost entirely over refused trades, caused by disagreements about what was 'fair'.</p>
              <p>During the game's post-mortem, it was eventually figured out (with some nudging and hinting from the supervising older-children) that children with rarer tokens had tended to think that the weight of a token's value for its even division ought to be determined by that token's scarcity; children with tokens that produced lots of jellychips (even if they required some other tokens to be nearby to work) tended to think that direct jellychip production was the obvious starting anchor for weighing economic value; children with tokens that produced other tokens argued themselves to have the only goods that mattered in the long run, and that you'd need a lot of lesser tokens to trade fairly for one of those.</p>
              <p>This begins the pathway of learning that leads to market prices, the other way of setting prices; in which larger Civilization has a collective interest in seller prices ending up close to the marginal cost of production, so that as many trades as possible occur.</p>
              <p>Children who master the complications here have officially passed Financial Literacy Layer 2, and can have their own investment accounts*, which was the main reason Keltham was going through this whole lesson-sequence at age seven instead of age eight.</p>
              <p><br>(*)&nbsp; Having an investment account in dath ilan is the equivalent of having a 'bank account' in other places, rather than a mark of greater financial maturity than that.&nbsp; Dath ilan doesn't particularly use, as a store of value, currency-denominated packaged bank debt with fixed returns. &nbsp;Value is stored mostly in equities.&nbsp; When you write a check against your investment account, divisible fractions of equity are automatically sold out of it in some medium of exchange, and automatically reinvested in the receiver's account, according to the (simple) autoselling and autobuying algorithms on both sides.&nbsp; If you want to pay for less volatility in your assets, you buy insurance on the equity, so that somebody agrees to buy the asset from you if it drops below 80% of its original-purchase price; and the price of insurance like that is a risk signal.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>When it comes to selling knowledge to aliens, to be clear, Financial Literacy Layer 2 is not going to get you there.&nbsp; If the answer across every plausible premise was trivial and similar, that trope wouldn't be such a staple of dath ilani economic fiction.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, Golarion is not nearly weird enough for Cheliax to be composed of aliens in the relevant sense; the Chelish have money and will tell you how many unskilled-labor-hours it corresponds to.&nbsp; The most you have to worry about is that somebody gave them a dishonesty card - which does mean you have to do your own calculations about what's fair, and not just ask them.</p>
              <p>When you are not dealing with&nbsp;<em>alien</em> aliens, when setting prices with those aliens is not <em>the point of the story,</em> a normal dath ilani would consider the solution obvious.&nbsp; There comes a saturation point beyond which individuals cannot realistically use any more money to become happier themselves, for usual reasons of just-noticeable-differences being a mostly-constant fraction of how much you already have, which implies utility roughly logarithmic in wealth.&nbsp; If the aliens offer to pay you that much, asking them to cough up more would mean that a number of poorer aliens would all have to give up chunks of utility that loom larger for them, so that you could get much smaller amounts of utility; and even if that's fair, it isn't Good.&nbsp; If the aliens offer an ultimatum for <em>less,</em> turn them down with very high probability; they're trying to give you far less than you're worth.&nbsp; Would Civilization offer less than a billion labor-hours to an alien bearing knowledge of how to eliminate whole swathes of diseases hitting large sections of the population?&nbsp; (No.)</p>
              <p>Of course, in a normal dath ilani economic-fiction isekai story, <em>the entire world you end up in is not insane in every part; </em>there may be&nbsp;<em>one</em> insane point of departure with some insane consequences lawfully extrapolated, but the author is not going to throw an <em>entire</em> insane world at you; it wouldn't be credible.</p>
              <p>A normal dath ilani, thrown into another world, does not come in expecting to need enough money to make lots and lots of important investments that the natives haven't made because the natives are insane.&nbsp; They're expecting to find an <em>alien</em> efficiency of no simple ways to make everyone collectively much wealthier, not the <em>howling absence</em>&nbsp;of that efficiency.</p>
              <p>Keltham wasn't expecting Golarion either.</p>
              <p>He did, however, catch on in short order to what he currently thinks is the magnitude of the problem.</p>
              <p>It is possible he will need a lot of money to solve it.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>If you've actually got to negotiate with very humanlike aliens, you need Financial Literacy Layer 5; or at least, Keltham hopes that's what he needs, because that's what he has.&nbsp; This gives him access to a spotlighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value">permutation-based method</a> for determining the fair contribution of one actor to a multiagent process.&nbsp; It's not spotlighted nearly as hard as, say, the Probability axioms, or Validity; but it's pretty much the only spotlighted method for that kind of fairness, and Civilization is somewhat hopeful that aliens will use it too.</p>
              <p>The permutation-based method says to consider how much marginal added value an agent produces, by being added to a collection of other agents, when considering every possible order in which to add all agents into the evaluation.&nbsp; If, for example, two people are both needed to complete a task worth 10 jellychips, and it can't be completed at all without both of them, then there's two possible permutations:</p>
              <p>Permutation 1:<br>&nbsp; Alis:&nbsp; Alis alone receives 0 jellychips; her marginal value, added to the empty set, is 0.<br>&nbsp; Alis+Bohob:&nbsp; After adding Bohob, the payoff is 10 jellychips; Bohob's marginal product, added to Alis is 10.<br><br>Permutation 2:<br>&nbsp; Bohob:&nbsp; 0 jellychips.<br>&nbsp; Bohob+Alis:&nbsp; 10 jellychips.</p>
              <p>Averaging the marginal products together across all permutations, the method says that Alis and Bohob both receive 5 jellychips.</p>
              <p>Yes, this is a very simple answer to be produced by all that logic, but the point is that it generalizes.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Applied directly to the situation with Cheliax, the method says, roughly, that Keltham should receive an amount proportional to how much marginal product he adds, on average, to all possible (ordered) subsets of Cheliax.&nbsp; If Cheliax had only half its current people, for example, Keltham might only add around half as much value.&nbsp; For even smaller subsets of Cheliax, product might fall superlinearly; Keltham couldn't necessarily accomplish 1/20,000,000th as much with a single Chelaxian.</p>
              <p>It adds up to 'somewhat less than half of his marginal product when added to all of Cheliax, probably'.&nbsp; Yes, this is a very simple answer to be produced by all that logic; but the point is that Keltham knows <em>why</em> that is&nbsp;<em>the fair</em> answer and what he ought to do if he gets offered less.</p>
              <p><br>Keltham doesn't spell out this part explicitly, or say that he was willing to accept Cheliax's opening offer taken at face value, and indeed would have compromised on substantially less had it been necessary.&nbsp; Cheliax mentioned difficulties in accurately measuring the gains to the country, and may intend to offer a measuring methodology expected to be an underestimate of the real value; or it could be that Cheliax is thinking the split is about direct profits from project sales, where Chelish consumers are capturing much more value than the sale price of the products, the consumer surplus.</p>
              <p>Also Keltham might find there's weird terms or conditions in there, in which case he wants to get the highest initial offer on hand so he can burn percentage points as bargaining power, to iron out the terms and conditions.&nbsp; He can always hand back any excessively generous jellychips that are still left at the end of that.</p>

              <p>Earth's economists have concluded that it is 'irrational' to refuse a $9:$1 split, since it leaves you $1 worse off.&nbsp; They note that human subjects seem to be 'irrational' by occasionally refusing offers below $5 with increasingly great probability as the offer drops.&nbsp; Perhaps it is meta-rational to develop a <em>reputation </em>for acting 'irrationally', since it causes people to make you bigger offers, if they know you'll irrationally refuse smaller ones?&nbsp; (For some reason they don't continue on to ask why not develop an 'irrational' reputation for refusing all offers below $9, instead of $5.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Sometime even later, Thellim is going to conclude that maybe it's&nbsp;<em>not</em> the moon.&nbsp; She will then wonder if there's <em>any way</em> to explain to Earth economists how the absolute basics of negotiation work in coherent decision systems (eg those consistent under reflection in the presence of correlated agents and/or models of agents).&nbsp; Or even, minimally, get them interested in what sort of 'irrational' behavior rational agents want to have 'reputations' for having, and if there's any <em>systematic structure</em> in there that might possibly be&nbsp;<em>interesting.</em></p>
              <p>It turns out that Earth economists are locked into powerful incentive structures of status and shame, which prevent them from discussing the economic work of anybody who doesn't get their paper into a journal.&nbsp; The journals are locked into very powerful incentive structures that prevent them from accepting papers unless they're written in a very weird Earth way that Thellim can't manage to imitate, and also, Thellim hasn't gotten tenure at a prestigious university which means they'll probably reject the paper anyways.&nbsp; Thellim asks if she can just <em>rent</em> temporary tenure and <em>buy</em> somebody else's work to write the paper, and gets approximately the same reaction as if she asked for roasted children recipes.</p>
              <p>The system expects knowledge to be contributed to it only by people who have undergone painful trials to prove themselves worthy.&nbsp; If you haven't proven yourself worthy in that way, the system doesn't want your knowledge even for free, because, if the system acknowledged your contribution, it cannot manage <em>not</em> to give you status, even if you offer to sign a form relinquishing it, and it would be bad and unfair for anyone to get that status without undergoing the pains and trials that others had to pay to get it.</p>
              <p>She went and talked about logical decision theory online before she'd realized the full depth of this problem, and now nobody else can benefit from writing it up, because it would be her idea and she would get the status for it and she's not allowed to have that status.&nbsp; Furthermore, nobody else would put in the huge effort to push forward the idea if she'll capture their pay in status.&nbsp; It does have to be a huge effort; the system is set up to provide resistance to ideas, and <em>dis</em>incentivize people who quietly agreed with those ideas from advocating them, until that resistance is overcome.&nbsp; This ensures that pushing any major idea takes a huge effort that the idea-owner has to put in themselves, so that nobody will be rewarded with status unless they have dedicated several years to pushing an idea through a required initial ordeal before anyone with existing status is allowed to help, thereby proving themselves admirable enough and dedicated enough to have as much status as would come from contributing a major idea.</p>
              <p>To suggest that the system should work in any different way is an obvious plot to steal status that is only deserved by virtuous people who work hard, play by the proper rules, and don't try to cheat by doing anything with less effort than it's supposed to take.</p>
              <p>Thellim could maybe solve this problem if she put around five years of her life into taking the knowledge, and putting it into a form where the system thinks it's allowed to ever look at it or talk about it without that being shameful.&nbsp; But Earth has problems that are plausibly more important than their entire field of economics being firmly convinced that a particular set of crazy behaviors are 'rational' and that healthy, prosocial, equilibrium-solvable behaviors are 'irrational'.</p>
              <p>She ends up writing a handful of blog posts about it, tossing mentions of it into a couple of stories she writes on the side, and otherwise leaving Earth to its fate there; Earth has rather a lot of awful fates going on simultaneously, and that one is not <em>literally </em><em>their most important problem</em>.<br><br></p>
              <p>This, however, is not her story.</p>

It - wouldn't even be hard, with magic, you wouldn't need coordinated distractions but <em>no one would do it,&nbsp;</em>even if you'd made a very bad mistake at school and were going to be disciplined -" they did check, Taldor beats students for misbehavior too. "You don't have to..... be so nice to children they wouldn't ever occasionally wish their school was on fire, you just have to teach them enough discipline that even when they wish it was they&nbsp;<em>don't do it."</em></p>

              <p>"I suspect there's some weird sticking point here that - look, sufficiently young kids <em>do</em> get slaps on the wrist.&nbsp; Civilization doesn't like it,&nbsp;<em>I</em> don't like it, but even dath ilan never figured out how to produce healthy adults while never doing that at any point.&nbsp; There are elements of morality and personhood that humans just weren't designed to learn without experiencing small amounts of pain in childhood.&nbsp; But every time you set up a situation where a kid gets told that they need to do something or else get slapped on the wrist, you also add some value to an investment account the kid gets access to when they're older, such that even if the kid <em>was</em> secretly an adult in a kid's body, they would still be calculating a net benefit on being present for the whole transaction.&nbsp; To make sure the <em>total&nbsp;</em>interaction is still&nbsp;<em>mutually beneficial,</em> which means,&nbsp;<em>beneficial to them too,</em> so that&nbsp;<em>ideal</em> kids wouldn't have an <em>ideal </em>incentive to escape their parents or destroy the whole system.&nbsp; Civilization goes on optimizing its heritage and the kids keep getting smarter and more Law-comprehending, which means that you always check all the interactions with children to make sure that the system wouldn't fall apart if the kids started being more ideal intelligences than expected one year.&nbsp; And having to pay that amount to set up a potential wrist-slap situation reminds adults to check, every time, whether they really needed a wrist-slap there."</p>
              <p>"I realize you can't afford any of that, but it&nbsp;<em>is</em> how Civilization thinks.&nbsp; We don't want to build into the system a load-bearing assumption that our kids are stupid and weak, even if they&nbsp;<em>are.</em>"</p>

              <p>The most obvious, thinks Meritxell, is that you don't actually want adults who believe themselves entitled to blow up any system that isn't serving them, because then you end up like Taldor having a civil war every few years.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The most obvious, thinks Tonia, is that kids can in fact run away and get eaten by wild beasts if they want, and none of them do, so they obviously think being around their parents is better than not that, which they're right about.&nbsp;</p>

It doesn't&nbsp;<em>matter,&nbsp;</em>it's all&nbsp;<em>nothing&nbsp;</em>next to the magnitude of the gift they've already been given, the only reason they're even able to parse it instead of rounding it off to the zero it is is because their minds are broken and they're very small and stupid. If a god were somehow born into a human child's body they wouldn't care if they got hit in class or not; human weakness isn't any particular nature of the bribes but the fact they're required at all, and planning for more perfect agents would mean planning for agents whose thoughts were too big and vast to give this question a second's contemplation.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham shall now observe to them that, if Meritxell has 12 green and prefers two blue to three green, and Gregoria has 12 blue and prefers two green to three blue, then all of the trades "5 green for 7 blue", "6 green for 6 blue", and "7 green for 5 blue", are&nbsp;<em>mutually beneficial,</em> but differently divide up&nbsp;<em>the gains from trade.</em></p>
              <p>There's a lot of different ways for jellychips to be arranged such that they can't be moved around without making at least one player worse off.&nbsp; For example, Meritxell could have all the chips, and nobody else could have any.&nbsp; Then any other way of arranging the chips will make Meritxell worse off!&nbsp; So that's one of the many possible global optima.</p>
              <p>Different paths through the mutually beneficial trades will take you to different global optima.&nbsp; So long as all the trades&nbsp;are mutually beneficial, you won't end up&nbsp;<em>worse off than if you never traded,</em> at the end; but you might end up much worse off than if you'd <em>traded more carefully.</em></p>
              <p>Keltham is a bit surprised that they didn't more quickly see the way in which this game resembled real life, since they seem pretty good at mathematical comprehension of the sort of structure that this game has in common with real life.&nbsp; But that will come with having more than one day's practice with parsing up games and real life into the pure abstract structures and simple mathematical properties they have in common - with parsing up real life as a shadow of Law, that is then recognized at once when incarnated in some much simpler game.</p>

              <p>"The market price of shoes should settle somewhere not too far from the costs of making leather and going to cobbler lessons, not settle at nearly the absolute maximum price that anybody around would pay to be allowed to ever wear shoes again.&nbsp; So people are <em>noticeably</em> better off because of shoemakers existing at all, rather than being <em>only a tiny bit better off</em> because the selling price of shoes is so astronomical that it cancels out almost but not quite all of the real benefit that people get from shoes."</p>

              <p>"Though in this situation, if it's the&nbsp;<em>last round,</em> there's not much of a loss from carrying out your part?&nbsp; If you both witness the randomness generation and it says you get the lower side of the split, failing to follow through at that point just causes nobody, including you, to be the winner.&nbsp; The game instructions don't say that you do any worse by scoring lower than average - you either win or don't win.&nbsp; It's a bargain where you don't actually lose anything from following through, even if you lost, which is part of the reason I'd expect it to work even in a lower-trust situation."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham describes the sad situation which eventuates when you do hand out dishonesty cards to kids.&nbsp; They work hard, propose splits that they guess are fair, not being able to trust the other person, and then sometimes those splits get rejected.&nbsp; The kids get angry!&nbsp; There is shouting!&nbsp; They get sent home for the day without having a solution shown to them, because it's good for them to sometimes dwell with problems that don't get solved immediately.</p>
              <p>(He doesn't tell them about younger-Keltham's emotional difficulties with being asked to act out a dishonesty card; he has a sense that Chelaxians would have trouble relating, for some reason.&nbsp; Maybe they'd say that even at age seven you should be able to understand that the game isn't real and just do what the card says?)</p>
              <p>If Keltham has understood correctly, Cheliax considers the obvious game solution to be even splits of jellychips, irrespective of work difficulty; which is repeatedly randomly unfair, and hence asymptotically fair.&nbsp; Going into any one game, you are equally likely to get faced with a harder or an easier task for your fixed payment, and if you repeat that often enough, the expected unfairness as a fraction of all payments will drop as the square root of the number of repetitions.&nbsp; It's not actually too bad, as solutions go.</p>
              <p>Still, if Cheliax already has a better solution to the dath ilani game, or to the real-world situation that it stands for, Keltham stands ready to hear it?</p>

              <p>"The initial notion of a fair price has to come from somewhere - from the part of yourself that initially suggested 6:6 in the Ultimatum game, which reflects a bit of Law I'll describe later - but once you get that notion of fairness from somewhere, and put a system like this around it, no seller has an incentive to claim an unfairly high fair price, and no buyer has an incentive to claim an unfairly low fair price.&nbsp; And if they happen to honestly disagree about that anyways, in some ambiguous situation, they'll still complete the transaction with very high probability so long as they only disagree a little."</p>
              <p>"That, roughly, is how bargaining works in dath ilan over one-time trades:&nbsp; If somebody offers a price the other side thinks unreasonable, the other side says, 'That strikes us as an unfair division of gains, even if mutually beneficial as such; but if you made that your final offer, we'd generate a visible random number and accept with 10% probability'.&nbsp; And then the price-setting side can potentially offer further arguments about why the trade is more valuable than it looks, or make a better offer, or accept that low probability."</p>
              <p>"The bargaining process Carissa described earlier, for selling my shirt, sounded like - people were probably trying to sort of flail at that underlying structure, by acting like they might be very unlikely to take an offer, or be moderately likely to take an offer, as they got closer to an agreeable price?&nbsp; But with a lot more... weirdness, acting, in Baseline we'd say 'LARPing'.&nbsp; Maybe because they think they have to pretend a lowball offer isn't mutually beneficial at all, in order to justify rejecting it; and also with some incentives to be misleading, because the underlying signals aren't as precise and legible as saying '10%'... and there's an incentive to exaggerate, but then the other side knows you're probably exaggerating, so you exaggerate even more, and you get people saying these exaggerated statements that both sides know aren't true, but there's uncertainty about how <em>much</em> the speaking side thinks they're really exaggerated, and modulating that uncertainty ends up being the medium of communication?&nbsp; At least, that was my attempt to decode what Carissa described."</p>

              <p>No more anger and shouting!&nbsp; Yes, sometimes somebody says your offer isn't fair, and you say it is fair, and they generate a random number, and the random number says that neither of you get anything, and that is a little sad.</p>
              <p>But you know that they didn't claim that unfairness in order to try and profit at your expense; you know the incentives weren't like that, for them.</p>
              <p>And they know you didn't state your offer in order to try and profit at their expense; they know the incentives aren't like that, for you.</p>
              <p>You know they know you don't have the incentive to cheat, so you know that when they state a higher price than you think is fair, and end up rejecting your offer, they weren't trying to punish you for trying to cheat with a lower price.</p>
              <p>You can see how, if you kept on playing this game for a bit, pretty soon both sides would learn to converge on a similar concept of fairness, and fewer offers would get rejected.</p>

              <p>"The first answer is that outputs aren't always legible, and then you have to appropriately incentivize people's fairness on valuing the outputs.&nbsp; In the version of the training game that the kids got, how much&nbsp;<em>effort</em> they had to put in wasn't fully legible, but the&nbsp;<em>outcome</em> of the game being won was visible and unmistakeable.&nbsp; But suppose somebody is making a shoe; how good of a shoe is it exactly?&nbsp; Maybe you could pay a trained third-party shoe-evaluator to come in and say exactly what they thought it would be worth, but measuring your output objectively like that is <em>expensive</em>.&nbsp; What we have instead is the partially legible output of a shoe, where the quality of shoeparts or the evenness of the make or whatever it is that people value in Golarion shoes, might not be clear and objective to the point where the shoemaker and shoebuyer couldn't possibly disagree on it.&nbsp; So then they need to both reason in a way that incentivizes fairness from the other, without everything shattering with probability 1 in the presence of a small disagreement."</p>

              <p>Civilization emphasizes really hard to kids at this point that, when you reject a 7:5 split with probability &lt;6/7, you're not trying to <em>spitefully punish</em> the person, just make sure that their incentive curve slopes slightly downward as it moves away from what you think is fair. &nbsp;If you were trying to spite them in accordance with base instinct, you'd reject with probability a bit greater than 5/7, so that they lost almost as much as they tried to gain at your expense (even spiteful entities, obviously, will still subtract epsilon from their spiteful punishments to avoid the possibility of infinite resonating spitefights that even they don't want).</p>
              <p>Keltham has no particular reason to think Chelaxians are likely to make that particular error, but dath ilan emphasizes it hard to children, so it's probably important or a plausible error that somebody might otherwise make.</p>

If you're not Good and unwilling to do anything that's punishment, if you think you have some duty to keep people in the game when in reality they were born into the game and the only way out of it is their utter destruction. The whole point of pain - possibly not the whole point of pain, but a lot of it - is that it's a deterrent that can be delivered without destroying any value at all.

              <p>"Yes indeed; sometimes you can take an ideal-agent calculation whose naked specification is too large for even gods to compute, and either simplify it to an exact answer, or get a good and fast approximation of it."</p>
              <p>Keltham whiteboards a sum over every possible permutation of 12 tokens, pausing to explain dath ilani math symbols like 'all permutations' and 'initial string up to first appearance of this symbol'.&nbsp; For every possible order in which the tokens could be arranged, consider the marginal production that token adds, on the step it's added.&nbsp; (0-10 produces 0, 11-12 produces 12.)&nbsp; Then, divide that sum by the number of permutations.</p>
              <p>"This sum has 479 million, 1 thousand, 6 hundred terms," Keltham says.&nbsp; "I've already finished adding them up.&nbsp; How are you doing on that?"</p>

              <p>In which case they couldn't have studied a lot of combinatorics?? &nbsp;Keltham would really have guessed that 'this bit of spell with 12 elements has 479,001,600 possible conformations' would be an important chunk of spellcraft, unless things only work at all when there's only 1 possible conformation.</p>
              <p>Maybe you don't get to that part at second circle.</p>
              <p>Or maybe - this is a weird thought, but Keltham is starting to feel suspicious of a trend - Cheliax teaches combinatorics in some incredibly narrow way where they've <em>only </em>learned combinatorics for spells and not <em>combinatorics for everyday life??</em></p>
              <p>This probably isn't the most important thing right now, file it with the other 'Why are they so inconsistently X??'</p>
              <p>"Correct, but I'm not sure everyone was following along with that, so let's try a smaller scale version.&nbsp; Suppose I took four of you, lined you up in a randomized order - you can imagine it being visibly randomized, if you like - and gave 8 jellychips to whoever was standing second in line.&nbsp; On average, how many jellychips should you expect to receive if I run this procedure on you?"</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Yeah, the thing I was trying to force you to do with the four students in twenty-four possible orders was sum over the 6 possible ways you could be standing second in line, to make the point about how the sum is&nbsp;<em>defined</em> as being over every permutation.&nbsp; In retrospect, clearly, I should've started with the case of tokens labeled 2, 3, and 5, but I'm sort of making this up as I go along because it's been a few years and I don't remember some of the exercises let alone their ordering.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; Anyways -"</p>
              <p>"When you're trying to see if there's a way to do what ideal agents would do - or gods, if you think gods are powerful enough to be ideal about that particular case - you want to distinguish the Law that <em>defines</em> what the solution&nbsp;<em>is,</em> and any clever ways you come up with to&nbsp;<em>compute</em> the Lawful solution faster."</p>
              <p>"When you've got 12 identical tokens, such that any group of 11 or 12 of them will produce 12 jellychips, there's a symmetry argument which says that each token must get one jellychip.&nbsp; If you thought there ought to be a&nbsp;<em>coherence constraint</em> on the Law of fairness saying that holders of identical tokens should end up with identical payouts, you could use that to compute the answer even if you had no idea what the actual Law was.&nbsp; Often when you&nbsp;<em>do</em> see how the Law works, you can go back over a lot of your intuitions, and say, 'Oh, yes, that intuition I had previously was shadowing this coherence of the Law, even though I didn't know how the whole Law worked' and that's a kind of sanity check on whether you're reasoning correctly at all."</p>
              <p>"But the Law of fairness that <em>defines </em>the target answer for the '11 tokens of 12' problem is <em>in principle</em> a sum over 479,001,600 marginal productions, of which all but 39,916,800 are zero, and 39,916,800 of which are 12, divided at the end by 479,001,600.&nbsp; Which means that we can say there's a <em>single&nbsp;</em>ideal fairness formula that governs both the '11 of 12' game, and the '2, 3, 5' game, even if <em>shortcuts</em> or&nbsp;<em>approximations</em> for the particular cases of the formula can be different, in cases where a shortcut exists."</p>

              <p><br>Carissa wanted to know whether Asmodia was being impressive on purpose because an Asmodia who is trying to get Keltham's attention, or an Asmodia who is trying to be hard for Cheliax to replace - an Asmodia who has started playing for her survival against the project's interests, more than everyone in Cheliax is doing all the time - is a different problem than an Asmodia who is doing her best but bitter because she had been consoling herself that Cheliax was lying about Good and they turned out not to be. She thinks a disillusioned angry-at-Good Asmodia is probably usable. She is open to learning from someone with more experience with this, though.</p>

              <p>Carissa tries to think what Maillol will think if she tells him that she wants to try to talk Asmodia around. It would be nice if she could predict what Maillol thought about things so she could stop bothering the real one so often, but he still surprises her as often as not, and she isn't sure if he'll think this is Carissa being inexperienced at having a real command and accordingly stupid, or Carissa having weirdly good instincts&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">because Asmodeus dropped Keltham near her for a reason</span>.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>...she should focus on the lesson or she's going to get behind. And then Keltham will think she's kind of stupid, which ....might be good, if it means he thinks she's not a ringleader, but would interfere with attachment to her, she's pretty sure. Lesson it is.</p>

              <p>"Would you say those four properties sound like properties that any fair formula for a game like this one ought to have?&nbsp; Again, that's identical agents being treated identically, distributing all of the gains, the reward for playing two games is the sum of the reward for playing the games separately, and agents who contribute nothing receive nothing."</p>

              <p>"This is a mission for big girls," he informs her.&nbsp; "You are not adequately prepared for it.&nbsp; You were intended as a welcoming gift for Keltham.&nbsp; Somehow you've ended up with a great deal more responsibility than that.&nbsp; This will require rapid retraining."</p>
              <p>"Pilar is now an oracle of Cayden Cailean.&nbsp; That's the Chaotic Good god of drunkenness, if you're too loyal to know.&nbsp; It happened moments before Pilar could sign her soul contract.&nbsp; Mindreading shows that Pilar didn't want that at all, and that her request to be Maledicted if she needs to be executed was completely sincere.&nbsp; This matches up with earlier records of Pilar's thoughts being read, and is not currently thought to be an oracular power for evading having her mind read.&nbsp; Orders are to consider her an Asmodean in good standing, <em>for now.</em>"</p>
              <p>"Her giving cake to Sevar was a manifestation of her oracular curse, as was her distribution of sweets."</p>
              <p>"You failed to report the former event for the entire length of the morning.&nbsp; Had Security <em>not</em> known about this matter already, and had the Security officer present also failed to take explicit note of the anomaly <em>as every one of you did</em>, your failure to note Pilar's unusual behavior and report it to anyone, would have meant ignoring signs of a <em>catastrophic</em> underlying problem."</p>
              <p>"You can have that toe healed at the end of the day, or earlier if Keltham suddenly wants to sleep with you for some reason.&nbsp; Meanwhile, it is expected to provide you with a recurring reminder of the new level of Security awareness that is now required from you."</p>
              <p>"Broom is here by direct authorization of the Grand High Priestess and belongs to a Lawful Neutral god whose work conduces to Asmodeus's purposes.&nbsp; He is not authorized to give you orders and you should show him neither deference nor disrespect."</p>
              <p>"Highpriest Maillol has decided that Sevar seems to have the best current understanding of Keltham of anyone present, including himself.&nbsp; In the unlikely event that you prove to understand Keltham even better, Maillol might put you in charge instead.&nbsp; Try sabotaging Sevar to make yourself look better by comparison and Maillol will hurt you enough to mildly improve your soul before sending it onward to Hell."</p>
              <p>"Asmodia earned a punishment the previous evening but is not currently considered by Security to be an ongoing problem."</p>
              <p>"You're done here.&nbsp; Put your shoe back on."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa would not even <em>consider</em> making comments about that. Fate is clearly already incredibly tempted around here, despite having as far as anyone knows been extinguished a century ago.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>'</p>
              <p>She puts her headband back on. It's nice how she's not going to have to take it off this time.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There's no arguing that the girls are all in over their heads. She's not...actually sure that Security and Maillol are less in over their heads. Contessa Lrilatha didn't seem in over her head and the Queen didn't seem in over her head and Aspexia Rugatonn didn't seem in over her head but everyone who isn't on that level ...might, in fact, be in over their heads.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Well, she always wanted to be that good.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It's pretty obvious with a headband on that having a headband on isn't anywhere sufficient to achieve that. She's not sure a +6 headband would be, and while Wisdom might be more useful than Cunning it doesn't solve the problem either. The fundamental thing is that they're trying to do something very hard with little margin for error and at least one god actively opposed to their efforts, and while obviously being smart is necessary for handling that.....</p>
              <p>...Nefreti Clepati isn't dath ilani. Being smart doesn't even mean automatically deriving all the&nbsp;<em>Law&nbsp;</em>and becoming one with it, within the range that humans are capable of making themselves smart. What she knows now is what dath ilan taught seven year olds in a couple days of classes, and while she can feel that it has not only cleared up her confusion about what bargaining is, that it has lit a torch that casts some light on a dozen surrounding things, she can mostly only see everything she doesn't yet know.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>But Keltham likes her. And if he gets bored in a week then the other girls will be a week more prepared for Keltham to like <em>them</em>. And while she tries to maintain realistic expectations about how long he's likely to take to get bored, her actual honest guess, now that she's smarter, now that it's a bit easier to split out which predictions are defensive-predictions so she won't be sad about whatever happens - what a <em>flaw&nbsp;</em>to have in your brain -</p>
              <p>- her actual honest guess is that he won't get bored in a week. That he'll pick up additional girls at some point, because variety is highly motivating, but that she's already not interchangeable, to him.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>For some reason this feeling makes her wish that she'd fixed the Queen's bag so it could hurt her again. However, not flirting with the Queen was the smartest call she made this morning and she's going to persist in it even if it would be really nice to be in a lot of pain. And she's not quite on terms with Keltham where she could run up to him and say 'for reasons I can't tell you, I want you to break all my knuckles with a hammer' - he's not even there yet, he wouldn't enjoy it -</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She gives herself five minutes to spend staring out the window and daydreaming about things to tell Keltham to seduce him to Evil, and then tries to steer her mind back on to business. ...it's probably too late to pull Asmodia aside in a not-maximally-threatening way but she'll see if she happens to be able to catch her.</p>

"Keltham didn't, or this would be a very different conversation, and perhaps you will get it together by the time he's competent to read us at all, but I noticed. And, you know, I'm not worried about whether your incentives are pointed in the right direction. You're not an idiot - you're very clever, actually, or this would <em>also </em>be a very different conversation - and we're the most carefully-corrected batch of wizards in all of Cheliax at present. But. We are working in adversarial conditions, here, Abadar is&nbsp;<em>mad at us,&nbsp;</em>and to succeed under those conditions our success needs to be assured from more than one direction. Cheliax is doing its Chelish best to teach you how to handle yourself here.</p>
              <p>And dath ilan, if we were dath ilani students, would try to bribe you. On the utterly stupid assumption, if Keltham's telling it straight, that punishment doesn't work; or on the slightly less stupid assumption, if we figure the smart people in charge of dath ilan lie to their people as much as our smart people lie to us - and I don't think Keltham'd be very surprised, to learn that - that sometimes you hit a different corner of the motivational system, when you dangle a bribe in front of someone."

            <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodia puts on the headband.&nbsp; She's ever tapped herself with a Fox's Cunning, but there's said to be a subtle difference from the headband.&nbsp; That with spellsilver to anchor a more carefully refined enchantment than a hung spell, it can be smoother, more supportive, befitting something meant to be worn forever after.</p>
              <p>...she can't really tell the difference, in the first rush of clarity, it feels half as intense as Fox's Cunning but otherwise mostly the same.</p>
              <p>Mostly her newfound clarity is agreeing with her prior impression that, yes, her life is a complete loss in which nothing good has happened to her, nothing good is ever going to happen to her, and all of her goals now consist of being tortured less and staying out of Hell for slightly longer.</p>
              <p>It's definitely possible that having any prospect of anything good ever happening to her would hit a different corner of her motivational system.&nbsp; Dath ilan could be on to something there.&nbsp; Asmodia chooses not to say this out loud, where it would be a pathetic plea for help; if Sevar is running Detect Thoughts, which would be sensible of her, then she's welcome to the inward thought that isn't a plea for anything.</p>
              <p>"Or, alternatively, we only got the lectures for seven-year-olds so far and dath ilan's reasoning will seem much more understandable after a full week of lectures," Asmodia chooses to say instead.&nbsp; "Irresistibly compelling, even, which I assume is why they had us sell our souls first."&nbsp; Why not Sevar, though, that makes no sense.&nbsp; "And Abadar's mad at us?&nbsp; That sounds important."</p>

              <p>Then again - the other form of the thing she wants - isn't something that a lot of people want.&nbsp; Maybe it's genuinely easier to figure out what the Starstone does to the people it eats, than to figure out immortality.&nbsp; Though you'd think, if it was easy to solve, that Galt would use that instead of their famous soul-trapping executioner's blade, which Asmodia isn't interested in because the Hellknights will get to it sooner or later.</p>

"I suppose I don't need to tell you this, Asmodia, but most&nbsp; people run into five kinds of heresy the first time they try having an original thought, and we presently have a problem that we can't solve without a fair bit of original thought. I'm not, of course, an exception, but I suspect that the five kinds of heresy I end up at are entirely different from yours.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I want you to think anyway. You can end all your thoughts in 'and this is why I want my soul expended for magical power by the darkest of sorcerers', if you want, I don't care, though do mind that your only route to that is to impress me. I want you to try to understand the math underlying Law well enough that if we end up sticking more headbands on you you can derive things dath ilan didn't get around to teaching Keltham. I want you to do well enough at that Keltham notices, ideally, but I actually think I care more about the math than the Keltham noticing, and if you hate the idea of him noticing you in particular you can feed all your clever mathematical insights to Meritxell."

              <p><br>And along the way, while she's still wearing the intelligence headband, Asmodia asks herself what she understands about dath ilani <em>thinking.</em>&nbsp; There's obvious notions like, they've developed some inner thing like arcane sight that pierces through the Prime Material like a realm of shadows and sees Mathematics underneath it, but Keltham already knows that and isn't being shy about teaching it to them.&nbsp; Figuring out what they lied to Keltham about, filling in the holes of his knowledge - there's some parts that are obvious if you were raised Evil, what a perfected Lawful Good society carefully hides from children and citizens of questionable loyalty: sadism, the possibility that you can hit people to get them to do what you want, that you can force people to go on playing games they aren't being bribed to play.&nbsp; If Asmodia has an advantage in figuring out something like that, it will be the <em>math</em> that they censored from him.</p>
              <p>Is there any part of this that she has an elemental affinity for?&nbsp; The first day - wasn't an unhappy one, was as happy as any day in Cheliax ever gets, between the moments of anxiety and being sure that Keltham was fucking with them.&nbsp; They found out that it's possible to glance at a country of half men and half women, and pierce through the obscuring veil of matter to the Law behind.</p>
              <p>And the thought occurs to Asmodia, then - if she is, for some reason, allowed to think about dath ilani <em>thinking -</em> that there's something about Keltham's dath ilani attitude in the face of difficult problems that's - indomitable?&nbsp; Wrong word, and maybe Taldane doesn't have a right one.&nbsp; Something that isn't expecting that students only get problems that they've been trained to solve.&nbsp; Keltham does ask if Golarion has already tried and failed to solve problems, but only to know how difficult they'd be for him to solve, not to consider whether they might be impossible.&nbsp; You never get the impression for a fraction of a second that dath ilan itself would respect all of Golarion's past hard work as meaning anything.&nbsp; Why should they, when Golarion could stare at a country of half men and half women for millennia, bargain over shoes for millennia, and never see the towering structure of Law barely a step out of vision, that dath ilani seven-year-olds learn about from older boys?</p>
              <p>A lot of people in Golarion have tried to get immortality -</p>
              <p><small>(or get out of soul contracts)</small></p>
              <p>- but they weren't dath ilani.</p>
              <p>If nothing else, destroying a soul - if Abaddon, or the Starstone, can do that at all - or just putting a statue somewhere it will never, ever be reachable again even by the Hellknights or Hell - really <em>doesn't</em> seem like the sort of thing that a class of dath ilani children would give up on, if a teacher gave it to them as a puzzle they didn't know how to solve.</p>

It was changing shape all along, it was just less notable because there was still some available spell-building space. You can get better at scaffolding so you have space for more (and more powerful) spells. You can get another spellbook and build another scaffold, which will come out identical to the one you've currently got because the interactions that are shaping it are part of<em> you</em> not part of the spellbook.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa has absolutely no context with which to interpret any of the sounds coming out of this person's mouth at this point. Is she being reassured because she's ....thought to be an unhelpful amount of scared? But telling her the Queen might come for her wouldn't seem to help with that! Is she being mocked? Probably; she's out of place here, in her Worldwound uniform, and well aware that nobles tend to think that kind of thing is funny. Is there a deeper, secret message? Why would it matter what Carissa thinks about what the Queen thinks of her? Is she being told that if she's a shape that the Queen will think of as flirting-back like it or not she should actually just flirt back? But it's too late! The woman acknowledged it was too late! Is it a test of whether she internalized Maillol's lesson about it not mattering what she wants? But even before that lesson she was very clear on the fact that if the Queen wants something you say yes, no matter what it is and no matter how you feel about it. What's this person's <em>angle?</em></p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>A countess's heir apparently would have a lot of clothes, more than are really feasible to own or wear or get from place to place; a countess's heir, of course, would have servants which would help on the feasibility front.</p>
              <p>Carissa is not sure how much agency she is supposed to exert about the clothes-acquisition process but she figures more countesses' heirs err on the 'spoiled' side than on the 'meek' side so she tries to make demands, which go over fine; she wants fabrics that look like they'd be incredibly hard to do by machine, because they're labor-intensive and sufficiently non-repeating, since dath ilan will probably find those more impressive; a lot of laces are satisfactory on that front. She thinks that Keltham will be unamused by anything that takes an hour to lace up, so those are out.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She wants a dragonhide purse, because dath ilan won't have <em>that,&nbsp;</em>and she's tempted by necklaces that have tiny humanoid fae trapped inside them, pounding frantically at the crystal, but probably Keltham would get worried about them and ask if they want to be let out.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>....this is just occurring to her: do countesses' heirs who have a sadistic boyfriend have - she's not even sure what she's imagining - imaginative sex clothes of some kind. The obvious version would be, like, shirtsleeves that can lace together so as to bind your hands behind your back rather than lacing separately, or... maybe there's a particularly spiky kind of lingerie? Fabric is so expensive that Carissa thinks of this as a fairly ridiculous indulgence but now that she's thought of it it seems like someone would've, probably.&nbsp;</p>

Their opinion of her does not matter, and if she were just like this as a person then her life would be more convenient, and maybe she is just like this as a person, with the right handling which she just hasn't sought out.

            <div class='post-content'><p>Perversion 15:&nbsp; Ballroom clothing suitable for a Baroness, not quite at the Countess level; elaborate, but nothing that would overly impede a dagger-fight if you had to do that instead of dance.&nbsp; Cunning pleats and overlaps in the clothing would enable a lover to reach right through it for pleasure or punishment, in any number of various places and angles, without any need of removing it.</p>
              <p>Perversion 17:&nbsp; Loose slave garments and not-cripplingly-expensive-to-lose harem jewelry that would be suitable for a noble surrendering herself to a higher noble for sexual punishment after being defeated in a contest of wills and powers; according to a not-particularly-legible etiquette code that absolutely does distinguish this case from the case of a noble who got physically captured by another noble and forcibly redocorated by them, in which case, obviously, you'd be shopping at one of the other stores instead, because this store is only for noble submissives who are doing their own shopping.&nbsp; It's not considered gauche or mockery to wear this clothing even if you're not really surrendering yourself to a higher noble, and is instead a pleasing roleplay or flattery, which makes it much more popular than the primary use-case would suggest.</p>
              <details>
                <summary>Higher perversion levels spoilered</summary>
                <p>Perversion 18:&nbsp; A simply enchanted cursed belt which prevents you or anything you're wearing or holding from touching your own genitals, used for preventing self-stimulation.&nbsp; It won't stop a Mage Hand, but it's at least a little difficult to get yourself off with a Mage Hand.&nbsp; It won't stand up to a Dispel Magic and it doesn't have any indicators that would show a Dispel Magic had been used on it; that's more the sort of heavy-duty cursed equipment that a dominant would buy to use on a submissive.</p>
                <p>Perversion 18 (also):&nbsp; A whole-body outfit of leather straps, concealing nothing of importance, studded with solid metal rings any of which can be locked to any other.&nbsp; You'll need to also buy either these simple open-or-shut connectors, which you could just as easily manipulate to free yourself if your fingers weren't otherwise restrained, or these more time-consuming simple locks sharing a common key.&nbsp; You could be restrained and re-restrained in a very wide variety of positions using this, especially if you also buy these simply-enchanted adjustable-length metal bars with rings on either end.&nbsp; Uncaring use of this on you may require a cleric's attention afterwards, not that there's anything wrong with that.</p>
                <p>Perversion 20:&nbsp; An Asmodean fighter's leather armor, but interlaced through with subtle bands that can be tightened to reduce flexibility and resist motions, handicapping the wearer.&nbsp; If you were wearing this you could lose a hand-to-hand combat to a substantially less skilled fighter without it looking too unnatural.&nbsp; The groin protection can be detached without that affecting the restraining power of the rest of the armor.</p>
                <p>It's not that large a store floor, and even if Carissa keeps her focus relatively narrow, she's liable to notice, for example, a Perversion 24 enchanted metal bra whose breast cups go searingly hot any time you make a sound, a much more expensive Perversion 33 bra that sears you any time you disobey any order you hear, decorated aesthetic versions of many common torture implements that don't require overly expensive (for a noble) clerical attention afterwards, slave rags which sure look like ordinary slave rags except for somehow being four hundred times as expensive - oh, they're enchanted to automatically clean themselves without requiring some random laundry wizard to use Prestidigitation for two minutes, that's why they're four hundred times as expensive - and of course cuffs, whips, branding irons, acid droppers, and blindfolds with extraneous gold detailing and in some cases tiny rubies.</p>
              </details>
              <p>In many cases, one can tell on a close examination that this is definitely subwear that noble Asmodean submissives buy for themselves, rather than subwear for Asmodean dominants to buy for their subs; because the subwear is visibly designed in some way to allow or require the submissive to put herself into it, rather than for her to be restrained while somebody else puts subwear on her.&nbsp; (Obviously this is a matter of fashion signals rather than practice; it's not like you couldn't threaten somebody into putting this stuff on.)</p>
              <p>The male-focused section of the store floor is smaller, maybe a quarter of the size, but very much existent (for the benefit of that very very rare Asmodean who wanders into a store like this one and starts pondering anything to do with gender disparities).</p>

              </a>
            </div>
            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa has never really given a lot of thought to how the nobility lives, beyond deciding a decade ago she didn't want to be a court wizard because the mortality rate was appalling. Her plan was to start a magic shop, figure out who was the most important person to bribe, make them something beautiful every year for a present, and assume that sufficient to keep her out of everything else.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Her feeling now, looking at all of this, is - faintly infuriated? It seems very - fake - like they're playing the game of having sex, instead of just having sex like normal people. Carissa is not actually sure she is very interested in the game of having sex. She tends to have sex for advantage, which means that when she's having sex it's with people who have power over her, rather than people she has power over, but that's not a game, that's just how everyone's incentives are shaped. This is a game. The consequences are real but the thing itself doesn't seem any less fake, for that.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She understands, maybe, what Maillol was trying to tell her, that it wasn't all right for Keltham to have her because she said it was. That comes from the same world as this, a world where everything is a game, where someone might decide to put on these clothes and seduce someone just because it's fun, playing with the inevitable natural order of the universe but only that, playing.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa is pretty sure that her actual sexuality, which she unfortunately needs to keep track of because there's no time in her schedule at present to learn to fake it, doesn't resemble this. It is about belonging to someone with the power to do whatever they like with you, yes, but - it's not about belonging to them&nbsp;<em>because you're into that.&nbsp;</em>It's not about the fact power is sexy, it's just about power. It feels like a real distinction, at least inside her head. Insofar as it features clothes like this at all they were definitely picked for her by someone who likes her in them, not picked out herself.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Okay setting aside her actual sexuality, which being the product of a human mind is going to be stupid and incoherent, what does she want? Some of the fancy outfits that look like they definitely couldn't have been manufactured overnight as part of an elaborate effort to convince Keltham that masochism is a real thing, some things that look like they'd obviously only work with the cooperation of the wearer, some things for farther in project corrupt Keltham which don't as obviously only work with the cooperation of the wearer&nbsp; - she tries to model Keltham's reactions about magic chastity belts and Keltham in her head is making a face but not a 'no' face so she'll grab that -</p>
              <p>- she has a unhappy feeling that somehow looking at the more-dangerous stuff at all counts as flirting with Her Infernal Magistrix. Because everything counts as flirting with Her Infernal Magistrix, or at least everything done in the slightest awareness it might have effects on Her Infernal Magistrix. Anyway pushing Keltham too far too fast might make him decide to think too hard about the whole situation, so she won't get any of that. Yet.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"I think this is enough for now," she says, once she's picked out an outfit for ballroom dancing, which she does not do, while sexually accessible, which pants <em>work fine for,</em> and the magic chastity belt, "unless you're apprised of the whole situation enough to have opinions and advise otherwise."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>It's hard to figure out which possible responses to that potentially get her hand burned off in a way that non-government-employees don't get free healing for.&nbsp; She's <em>obviously</em> not apprised of the whole situation, which suggests that she definitely shouldn't say anything, but that's too obvious to be the meaning.</p>
              <p>"I have no experience or training in honeypot operations targeting unsuspecting Lawful Good targets.&nbsp; Government-approved literature has seemed to suggest that presenting yourself to a Lawful Good man in obviously self-applied bondage," gesturing at the outfit of leather straps, "will tempt him to do things to your helpless form, without that seeming to hurry him along the path to inflicting pain; and that tickling is useful as an intermediate step towards getting him to hurt you," gesturing at a shelf of tickling implements and lubricants labeled Perversion 3, "but I don't know if any of that's meant to be useful advice or a fictional conceit."</p>
              <p>Realistically shouldn't this be asked of a honeypot operator with experience targeting the boy's home country?&nbsp; But there's presumably some reason they aren't doing that and instead asking her and also aren't giving her any more information??&nbsp; Citing only government-approved advice is the only tactic she can think of for possibly getting out of this with mostly inexpensive injuries.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham asked questions about farming and other aspects of Chelish economics.&nbsp; Meritxell and Tonia mostly answered them, in a way that fits the hypothetical new Cheliax so far as Security could tell.</p>
              <p>Ione passed a note to Security offering to warn Keltham to maybe not trust everything Meritxell says about economics, because she might be overrunning her real knowledge - in a very enthusiastic and well-intentioned way, but still.&nbsp; Security is deferring that decision to Sevar.</p>
              <p>Ione oracled in one Ostenso library book about farmers - Security does still have the ability to redirect Keltham's thoughts away from text, and farming seemed innocuous.&nbsp; It didn't contain nearly as much direct detail on farming operations as Keltham had hoped; no illustrations of plows or mentions of how much a plow costs or who makes plows, and soon Keltham gave up and stopped reading.&nbsp; Keltham suggested establishing communications with somebody at the Ostenso library who could check through books first given a request for content, and leave a found book in a designated place for Ione to borrow.&nbsp; One Sending is an improvement over two teleports, or this potentially warrants a paired mirror.&nbsp; Security told him that Requisitions said she'd think about it; Requisitions in this case really means Sevar, they can get the mirrors if Sevar says yes.</p>
              <p>Asmodia has been keeping to her bedroom and rereading her math textbooks, which is overtly good behavior.&nbsp; She wasn't tightly monitored but spot-checking of thoughts suggests that she's anxiously locking down a lot of disloyal thoughts, nothing unusual for someone in her position though of course Asmodia isn't being told that, but certainly more anxiety and thought-suppression than would have been characteristic of her three days ago.&nbsp; Overt thoughts indicate willingness to work with Sevar on her mysterious project for dath ilani thinking, confusion about what the real purpose of that is, painful hope that maybe she can avoid Hell after all.</p>
              <p>Pilar was almost but not quite killed when a Security wizard got a message announcing one of his wives had successfully birthed a child, and Pilar shouted "Congratulations!" from directly behind him.&nbsp; Nobody including Pilar understands how Pilar got into the temple room where the wizard was receiving the message, and Pilar can't quite remember what she was doing just before that.&nbsp; Pilar thinks she could possibly learn to not do it to on-duty Security, so long as she can still do it sometimes to somebody, but on this occasion the impulse took her by surprise.&nbsp; Pilar is significantly shaken up about this, because if she'd died like that she wouldn't have been Maledicted first.&nbsp; Also, Pilar needs to throw somebody a larger party, preferably a surprise party; single pieces of cake being handed out on special occasions aren't going to cut it for her indefinitely.&nbsp; This is mostly Maillol's problem but is being copied to Sevar in case it somehow interacts with project matters, or for that matter in case she wants to advise Maillol that having a Chaotic Good oracle to exhibit to Keltham isn't worth that much.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Cayden Cailean is like the kind of god Carissa would have made up if she were a propagandist trying to convince Chelish people that Good is stunningly worthless and stupid. Probably it's fine if Pilar throws some parties, how expensive can that even be, though the only acceptable targets for surprise parties are the other girls and maybe whoever's on staff doing laundry or whatever. Coordination with the library in Ostenso seems straightforwardly good for the cause of passing Keltham only desired books, worth a mirror. If Tonia and Meritxell are the chattiest girls they should both get some training/screening for how to handle it if Keltham wants to fuck them.</p>

              <p>But there was a purpose of oracles of old.&nbsp; They cannot receive arbitrary messages from gods.&nbsp; They can receive presentiments, under negotiated conditions meant to ensure that those presentiments help to bring about Prophecy rather than avert it.</p>
              <p>Prophecy is shattered now, which is to say, depending on how you look at it -</p>
              <p>- Nethys now knows more than anyone else about how the future is otherwise destined to go, so, if anybody was supposed to still go around sending presentiments to oracles, it would be His job, wouldn't it?</p>
              <p>Nethys does have any options for conveying information to humans.&nbsp; They're just difficult and expensive and not the sort of thing that parts of Nethys can do on a whim, there has to be more power and unity behind it than Nethys usually tries to muster.&nbsp; Difficult, expensive, painful.&nbsp; It's rare for that much of Nethys to agree on anything.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Fuck you, I'll do what you don't want.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There's more to it than that, of course, Zon-Kuthon is not that easy to manipulate. &nbsp;Zon-Kuthon was somewhat on the fence about Nethys's strange request and stranger warning - He doesn't do what other gods want of Him, usually, but Nethys went more legible than was usual for Nethys and seemed to show knowledge about how the mortal, who admittedly looks rather strange, was likely to oppose Zon-Kuthon's own purposes and have the power to do that for some reason? &nbsp;That the mortal is in Cheliax is also not a good sign; Asmodeus is foremost among the gods who would actually choose to annihilate Zon-Kuthon and not just dislike Him. &nbsp;Zon-Kuthon ordered a strike team assembled, targeted, held ready, but has not given them the go sign.</p>
              <p>Zon-Kuthon is likewise aware that Otolmens is as wary of Him as of any god save Nethys. &nbsp;Dou-Bral once fought to seal Rovagug. &nbsp;Even if the expected balance of pain and pleasure and things that Zon-Kuthon now cares about, changed when Dou-Bral Himself changed to Zon-Kuthon and changed His expected effects on the world, one would expect Zon-Kuthon to be a lot closer to unleashing Rovagug than most other gods.</p>
              <p>The latest attempt at Otolmens telling Zon-Kuthon what not to do is sufficient to swing His decision, especially given that Zon-Kuthon does not expect to be caught.</p>
              <p>He orders the recipient of His vision to tell the team to attack immediately, and then to kill himself, without mentioning to anyone else that this was a fresh divine intervention rather than a previously given order.&nbsp; There's a closing opportunity window here, since if the strike team arrives fast enough, the belief of other gods should be that it was already in motion when the edict was laid.&nbsp; It's very unlikely anyone will see Him about it; any god trying to pay that much attention to all of Nidal would fragment themselves and drive themselves irrevocably mad.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Gorum, Chaotic Neutral god of battle, god of strength and weapons and soldiers, receives a message from a certain Someone who He is rather fonder of, than She is of Gorum.&nbsp; This is only to be expected, given that Her workings often conduce to His purposes; His workings, to Hers, not so much.<br><br></p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; She offers Him information, under the condition that She wishes it not revealed to other gods that She was the source of that information.<br><br></p>
              <p>Gorum accepts.&nbsp; He does not expect to be harmed by the mere reception of information however suspicious, He could always choose to ignore it and do nothing with it.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Zon-Kuthon is about to violate Otolmens's order in Pharasma's Name.&nbsp; If you look exactly here, you should be able to catch Him at it.</em></p>
              <p><br>Interesting.&nbsp; Yes, there it is.&nbsp;<em> What of it?&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon is not as opposed to My purpose as to those of others.</em></p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Zon-Kuthon has not much margin in His tolerance of the expected future state of Golarion.&nbsp; If nothing else is done about it, He is likely to attempt to release Rovagug during an upcoming major disruption to the world.</em></p>
              <p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; As much as You might have wished to use Zon-Kuthon as a counterbalance to Asmodeus, and have been among the foremost proponents of that, events have now been set in motion such that it is no longer safe to try to use Zon-Kuthon for that purpose.&nbsp; He cannot be allowed to remain as He is now.</em></p>
              <p><br>Part of the goddess speaking to Him goes legible; She is being truthful, though it is also clear that She is withholding much, for She does not likewise make legible that She is sharing all relevant information.</p>
              <p>Some of the shape of the connivance is becoming clear to Him.&nbsp; <em>Would this upcoming major disruption be any of Your own work, perhaps?</em></p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Perhaps.&nbsp; If it were, I would wish to conceal My hand and show it to few other gods, with this exception made to reduce the probability of a foreseeable outcome where the world ends up destroyed.</em></p>
              <p><br>Gorum knows He's being used, of course, but it does not offend Him as it might offend other gods; a soldier is a soldier whether they die for another's profit or their own.&nbsp; There is only one question He asks.&nbsp; <em>Will there be battle and bloodshed?</em></p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Deaths shall come faster than Golarion has seen in an age.</em></p>
              <p><br>Gorum will go along with this, then.</p>

              <p>Fights among high-level casters, in Golarion, don't last long. Most spells are deadly, and if one side or the other has reason not to use deadly force, there are plenty of decisive ways to end a fight with the other person living but, say, transformed into a hamster, or Plane Shifted, or turned to stone. An outnumbered wizard might have time to get a single spell off, or to empty the contents of their Bag of Holding onto the battlefield, or if they're well-trained to empty the contents of their Bag of Holding onto the battlefield while getting a single spell off, and then it's pretty much over, if they didn't pick that spell well.</p>

              <p>You'd think that dropping out of the sky on someone would hurt you as badly as them, which is not a good tradeoff when you're outnumbered, but 1) it's possible for even a random civilian to survive a fall from 60 feet if they let their legs break the fall, whereas it's less possible to survive the same force landing on your skull and 2) she has a healing spell almost finished as she lands, which means she's back on her feet faster, which means shortly after that it doesn't matter if the original injuries would've been fatal or not because Carissa can pull the sword out of Pilar's chest and stab him until they definitely are.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Cheliax has reinforcements teleporting in, by now, outside the Forbiddance. There are enough spells flying that all you can see are streaks of light and all you can hear are explosions and occasional screams.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Does this dead guy have, like, a dagger, in addition to the ridiculous ornamental sword, Carissa super does not have the strength to wield the sword effectively.</p>

              <p>He lands on top of the Kuthites about to attack Keltham without that significantly slowing his massive clawed feet from striking the ground.&nbsp; "Stay near me," he speaks in low rumbling Baseline, words that Carissa can probably recognize by now as dath ilani in intonation, even if she doesn't know the meaning.&nbsp; Then Gorthoklek begins speaking spellwords, and from him spring scorching rays, quickened fireballs, a meteor swarm.</p>

              <p><em>That said, this same record of previous divine intervention, and the timing, suggests that Zon-Kuthon probably already had His warriors on the way when Otolmens issued Pharasma's Edict and stands not in direct violation of it.&nbsp; I doubt He had an army already assembled and waiting, to be directed straight into Otolmens's interdicted region almost the moment she issued the Edict.</em></p>

              <p>If such a thing is to be done, and it does appear it might be necessary, it should be done at once and unanimously, because a day of war Golarion can withstand, but a fight that would last any longer than that will flood the crops in the fields and destroy the people and, down the line, the kingdoms relying on them.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Iomedae has considered, long ago, how this could be done. At the time it did not seem wise, and She has been apprised little of whatever prompted so many gods to change their calculations, but here is how it would be done, if sufficient resources are committed to the doing.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And if it is to be done She should hold the key, obviously, as a Lawful god opposed to Asmodeus (let's be honest,&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>Lawful god opposed to Asmodeus), and one who can be predicted to release Him under conditions satisfactory to everyone else save Asmodeus, whose awful conduct is of course the reason they've even been pressed to this dilemma.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p><br>...there is <em>clearly </em>plotting going on here, gods are not stupid, Gorum did not come across this information by coincidence.</p>
              <p>That Nethys <em>could </em>have given it to Gorum is almost too obvious to need thinking; but you can't go around blaming Nethys for everything, that's a way to miss all the other possibilities that aren't "Nethys did it".&nbsp; Also, contributing information leading to the downfall of another god, even Zon-Kuthon, would be pretty daring for Nethys; other gods are <em>aware</em> that Nethys could do more than the usual damage if Nethys started acting deliberately against other gods, and while Nethys might be able to get away with moving against Zon-Kuthon, out of all the gods,&nbsp;<em>once,</em> He'd be walking very thin ice after that, if He were ever found out.</p>
              <p>A plot between Gorum and Asmodeus??&nbsp; Some weird accommodation between them???</p>
              <p>Gods' minds are large enough to explicitly consider many possible hypotheses.&nbsp; They will consider the possibility that it was Somebody Else who made an accommodation with Asmodeus, and then successfully persuaded Gorum to turn against Zon-Kuthon using this information.&nbsp; They will consider the possibility that Zon-Kuthon was lured into doing this and that is why Gorum knew where to look to collect the evidence.</p>
              <p>It doesn't change the fact that Zon-Kuthon did in fact deliberately violate a Pharasma's-Name edict from Otolmens.&nbsp; This is kind of a big deal for any god, let alone Zon-Kuthon, who maliciously withdrew His powers from the Star Towers that Dou-Bral used to impale and weaken Rovagug within Its prison.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodeus is confused, and dislikes it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Those are inadequate words for the experience of being Asmodeus; words are generally inadequate for it, but those ones especially so. All of Caina grows colder, as Asmodeus withdraws His power from Hell in order to think; few ever enter or leave Nessus, and there is no word of what is happening there.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It obviously serves Him, for Zon Kuthon to be warred with, and locked away; it's why He bothered to vaguely insinuate this might be warranted. And it does seem like Zon Kuthon might be more willing to war with Asmodeus - not even for any clear reason! - than previously imagined, which makes the case for being rid of Him stronger.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>But this was orchestrated, unambiguously, maybe by Nethys, maybe by several gods collaborating (Iomedae and Irori? Sarenrae and Abadar and Cayden Cailean, who has been <em>intervening in Cheliax&nbsp;</em>for some not-known reason? A minor god, gambling everything?) and it is hard to imagine that the end towards which it was orchestrated was simply the removal of Zon Kuthon.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There's lots of minor things that could be attained in the short term by distracting Asmodeus with a war with Zon Kuthon. Cheliax will be drawn into a war with Nidal. Ground might be lost at the Worldwound. Perhaps a difficult province in Cheliax could break free.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It seems unlikely that a god made a move with these stakes for that practically trivial prize.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Asmodeus is confused, and dislikes it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And yet, when confused, it's better to have more resources than fewer, and it's better for Zon Kuthon to be gone.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>He indicates willingness to back imprisonment of Zon Kuthon, with more resources if the key goes to Gorum. And He'd like Iomedae to note that absolutely none of the recent nonsense is his fault; he's intervened only when fully paid by other gods, to direct his people in not harming mortals They got suddenly attached to.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>There is debate, but quickly; somebody might tip off Zon-Kuthon and then it all becomes harder.</p>
              <p>Most gods, not all, combine their powers; the rest agree at least not to interfere.</p>
              <p>The forging of a vault begins, with a key that Iomedae alone can turn.</p>
              <p>Sarenrae temporarily focuses nearly all Her will on the vault where Rovagug is imprisoned, she could not protect that vault from a full assault by Zon-Kuthon from every direction, but with Zon-Kuthon otherwise distracted she will be able to fend off any lesser attempts at that, if it does not come as a surprise.&nbsp; There also does Otolmens stand guard.</p>
              <p>And most of the other gods of Golarion assault Zon-Kuthon, everywhere that is <em>not </em>that vault; Zon-Kuthon must put the greater parts of Himself within it, or else be vastly diminished.</p>
              <p>That Zon-Kuthon will scatter smaller-sized fragments of His will and power beyond the vault, yet linked to His greater whole, is inevitable; it is not easy to really,&nbsp;<em>really</em> kill a god, if they have not made themselves vulnerable by collecting themselves too much into one place.</p>

              <p>Asmodia was in her bedroom and got swarmed by shadows, after which some summoned monster or another gnawed off all of her legs below her mid-thighs; after Asmodia's body got retrieved, it was dumped in one corner of the library, for use in later Resurrection or Raise Dead + Regenerate.&nbsp; A dead Security wizard's body has been dropped beside her.</p>
              <p>Ione is unconscious, and would ordinarily have been evacced, but, library oracle; if she's got to be in some library that's not a triage center, it might as well be this library?&nbsp; Ione's body is occupying the largest, best-padded chair in the library, arranged with some detectable amount of respect, hands folded in her lap like a noblewoman.&nbsp; Things could have gone <em>much</em> worse without that brief warning to put up buffs and ready items. &nbsp;If Nidal had been able to lock down communications before they could call for reinforcements, or get assassins past the wards without triggering them, it could have been <em>much much</em> worse.</p>
              <p>The other girls are - reading, some of them; Paxti is talking too fast to somebody who's tolerating that; one of them is examining a spiky dagger with a gem-studded hilt, not in the manner of somebody who expects to keep it, but somebody who wants to take a good look at it before Security takes it away.</p>

              <p>Were the two Auguries meant to indicate that this particular Augury was really important - that's plausibly - that's plausibly it, if he'd cast the second Augury then, and got a result of massive disaster from heading outside the Forbiddance, that would've - maybe that was what was meant to happen but how was Keltham supposed to <em>know</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>he'd thought it was one spell to figure out what the spell&nbsp;<em>was</em> and then the second one when he'd had time to think of a question -</p>
              <p>Not his fault, plausibly, in a way that makes sense to blame himself for; there's no obvious actually-general heuristic to update, here, that isn't just "use both Auguries on the first question to enter your mind".&nbsp; Keltham's god might not have been able to exactly predict -</p>
              <p>"I got two Auguries.&nbsp; I thought the first one was to find out what the spell was and the second one was for when I'd had time to think of the right question.&nbsp; If my god thought that three-quarters the first Augury wouldn't fail, but if it did fail, I would use the second one - or if people just always get two Auguries for redundancy - then maybe we weren't supposed to go outside, we were supposed to get a result showing disaster if we went outside and <em>that</em> would have tipped us off&nbsp;<em>without us going outside.</em>&nbsp; If that's true then my god is not a perfect predictor, they're not looking into the future, they're working off a fallible model.&nbsp; In that case they wouldn't have been able to do exact timing, and that attack was set to go off <em>the moment I went outside,</em> not because my god predicted the timing that precisely."</p>
              <p>"Similarly, when it comes to Zon-Kuthon, our two obvious hypotheses are, one, attack was building since yesterday, god warned us of it yesterday.&nbsp; Two, that spell was a warning of something else, I misinterpreted it as Zon-Kuthon, and somehow <em>that</em> triggered the attack by Zon-Kuthon, like by my thinking of him loudly enough that he heard it like a prayer, which does not seem particularly plausible to me but I'm saying it out loud anyways because Golarion."</p>
              <p>Or, of course, somebody in Governance heard him say it, and thought it would be a great thing to fake without the slightest use of subtlety.&nbsp; The light shows overhead - could have been locally faked to look global.&nbsp; Maybe Ione can grab a <em>newspaper</em> from Ostenso library and see if it mentions -</p>
              <p>Well, that might work if Ione is still Ione.</p>
              <p>"So.&nbsp; How did they know the moment I went outside."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>" - I don't know. Security cast - really cast, I'd have noticed if he did something weird - a bunch of standard detection spells, at the edge of the Forbiddance. There wasn't a scry up on the other side, or an alarm spell set to trip, or any magic at all, or anyone hidden and waiting - could've been someone's bonded familiar, a ways off, with vision enhanced to see through invisibility. Or could be Security was compromised, or Pilar, or me. Or you, I guess, if we're being thorough, though even then, they'd have had to have activated a magic item or something to alert people, and the others ought to have&nbsp;<em>noticed.&nbsp;</em></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><em>....</em>why was Pilar there. She isn't usually - when you test your spells - she wasn't when we did Detect Anxieties or Detect Desires -" Pilar had been checked and had totally satisfactory Anxieties and Desires but the plan had been not to have her mostly because there wasn't a good excuse&nbsp;<em>to&nbsp;</em>have her and not the other girls. Oh and now that Carissa thinks about it the reason Pilar was there was obviously 'some weird thing to do with her oracle powers' and she should not have completed that sentence aloud, though probably Keltham would himself have noticed the discrepancy, at some point...</p>

I don‚Äôt know how badly the villa is damaged, but I think it‚Äôll be in repairs for at least the next couple of weeks, and they might decide to relocate us to the Imperial palace - which is the only other place in Cheliax with a Forbiddance up, and which has security adequate for an invasion from anywhere I‚Äôve heard of.

            <div class='post-content'><p>Dath ilani - shouldn't be weak enough to need two weeks of recovery time after their first experience with somebody trying to kill them, should they?&nbsp; Though they certainly have a very, very different attitude towards violence than Cheliax.&nbsp; You learn the potential for defense in reality so that aggression stays confined to counterfactuals.&nbsp; Cheliax has public executions.</p>
              <p>Dath ilan has executions too, in a certain sense; if you intentionally cause someone else's True Death, you don't get kicked to the Last Resort, you get forcibly and preemptively cryosuspended.&nbsp; Not as a deterrent, obviously, because ideal agents ignore those, and Civilization doesn't build structures that would stop working if people became more ideal.&nbsp; Because anybody that dangerous is more danger than Civilization wants to inflict on the non-true-murderers in the Last Resort.&nbsp; Civilization has a motive to preemptively suspend people that dangerous irrespective of its effect on incentives; it's not a <em>threat</em>.</p>
              <p>Obviously if a Chronicler or a family member asked to be present at the preemptive suspension, and the murderer didn't veto it, Governance would hardly block them.&nbsp; You could probably do it as an ordinary concerned citizen and it's hard to see Governance stopping them without an overwhelmingly strong reason.&nbsp; Governance, which has way too much power to say 'no' to things, has to be very circumspect about what it actually says 'no' to, if it doesn't want the Annual Oops It's Time To Overthrow The Government Festival to suddenly turn real.</p>
              <p>Keltham has a suspicion that Cheliax's 'public executions' are not 'public' in the sense of 'open to sufficiently concerned citizens wanting to make sure everything has been done correctly'.&nbsp; It rhymes with Carissa's earlier claim that the thing to do with rats is feed them to other rats in a frenzy of cannibalistic death and sell tickets.&nbsp; Public executions, Keltham suspects, have tickets; though it's the sort of thing he should check later, maybe by asking Carissa what the equilibrium price of the tickets are rather than if the tickets exist at all, if he's feeling paranoid that minute.</p>
              <p>It's not like it's not consistent.&nbsp; It would pass muster as fiction.&nbsp; Low-tech society with poorer coordination, sustained by economicmagic, with healing, resurrections, and afterlives.&nbsp; Losing a finger isn't permanent until the distant Future can restore it; there are clerics.&nbsp; Not-true-death means you come back - well, you come back if you had enough money to buy insurance.&nbsp; Life in Golarion must be a pretty different experience for its relatively wealthy people and relatively poor ones!&nbsp; Like, <em>qualitatively&nbsp;</em>different, two worlds with different tech levels.&nbsp; But everyone gets the afterlife, it sounds like.&nbsp; Unless they betray an oath.&nbsp; Or Nethys touches them.&nbsp; Or how common is that statue business, he should check with somebody else, Carissa doesn't seem like the type to fret about Statistically Improbable Awful Fates.</p>
              <p>And, sure, you can imagine a society like that, where they don't give a shit about violence because the injuries aren't permanent.&nbsp; Where they don't give a shit about death because resurrection and afterlives.&nbsp; A society where people getting near the end of their natural healthspan, when they're starting to feel sick enough and stupid enough that they're not having fun, would have violent fights to the death with one another like that's a sporting event - actually maybe public executions <em>wouldn't</em> sell tickets, those are probably much more boring compared to suicide sports.&nbsp; So why <em>are </em>executions public?&nbsp; He'll try to remember to ask later.</p>
              <p>You could tell a consistent story where a dath ilani boy would be a fragile little flower by comparison to all that, and he'd take a long time to recover from somebody <em>almost</em> sticking him with a sword and instead sticking that sword into a girl he met two days ago.</p>
              <p>Keltham doesn't like this story, and he's trying to decide if that's his real self talking, or just his gendertrope.&nbsp; Well, his gendertrope <em>is</em> him to no trivial degree, he's at 10.2 out of 12 on the gendertrope identification scale.&nbsp; And it's not like zero optimization ever went into making the masculine gendertrope be a useful target for males to try to live up to.&nbsp; But still.</p>
              <p>But it's more that - Keltham has a sense that - there's something false about Cheliax's rejection of the idea that violence could be harmful.&nbsp; That it rhymes with Permanent Cheerfulness and Acting Like Sex Still Works Normally.&nbsp; The pain is still real, the suffering is still real, even if the injury and death are temporary and discarnation isn't the end.&nbsp; This is like - the sort of weird equilibria exhibited as stuff that might happen, if not for Civilization and not for mental training, hence why people have to go on playing strange games with children to let them be not that.&nbsp; A proving-things-to-people equilibrium like a duke's crazy son being challenged to prove his courage by racing a rhinoceros.&nbsp; Where people try to show off really hard how much injury and death don't matter to them, and end up dumping Asmodia's body in a corner without any respect shown to it while her soul's not in it.</p>
              <p>If dath ilan had healing and resurrections, it would not be like that.&nbsp; He doesn't think the Kelthamverse would be like it either.</p>
              <p>Or maybe he's wrong.&nbsp; He hasn't lived in the Kelthamverse plus healing, resurrection, and afterlives.</p>
              <p>But the fact that Chelish people still end up in shock for two weeks after their first fight with demons - suggests that their forcing their minds to be disdainful of violence's impact - doesn't quite work.&nbsp; Is possibly making things worse for them.</p>
              <p><br>"I want to&nbsp;<em>be</em> safe, not&nbsp;<em>feel</em> safer," is what Keltham says to Carissa when she gets back.&nbsp; "I don't think the foreseeable difference in the psychological impact of a semifamiliar place where an attack happened, versus a completely unfamiliar place somewhere else, is great enough to count against a 0.1% difference in actual securability.&nbsp; And - maybe this doesn't apply in this case, but - in dath ilan, if a mental shock isn't mostly better in the morning, and hasn't reached a new equilibrium after three days if it's not better in the morning, that would be the point at which you'd talk to somebody smarter or better-disciplined about mental errors you might be making that would cause internal conflicts to get stuck and not resolve.&nbsp; I won't push myself if it turns out I can't recover that fast, won't try to act outwardly normal if that's not true, but - it's the recovery timescale I would've guessed if you hadn't mentioned anything."</p>
              <p>"Oh, and I register with my amateur Security posturing that it seems to me that bringing Pilar back or contacting her early in the afterlife - to see if <em>she&nbsp;</em>has any idea how or <em>why</em> she was put there - is a Security issue higher than her ordinary resurrection priority."</p>

What a convenient preference from Keltham. "It'd be great if you're all right in a couple of days, some people are, and you can definitely talk to a priest about it if you want - and some of the ways people aren't all right might be irrelevant to you, like, people get flinchy in similar situations and that's a big liability if you have to hang out on the same wall fighting demons but much less of one if you never have to encounter a Kuthonite again."</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- well, exquisitely designed to some unapologetically Evil aesthetics. It has thick red velvet curtains around an enormous iron bed which has actual chains and shackles built into the headboard, and a thick red carpet, and an enormous fireplace against one wall.</p>
              <p>Next to the fireplace is a rack of fire-stoking equipment which a person who knows a lot about fire-stoking, which Keltham hopefully does not, might identify as not even all that useful for that.</p>
              <p>There's a cozy reading nook with an armchair and a tall bookshelves full of leather-bound books, and a little kneeling pillow next to the armchair.</p>
              <p>There's an Asmodean shrine with incense and a stone ritual-seat that you obviously let blood into.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There are beautiful tapestries on the walls, depicting well-dressed people dancing, and there's a window opening on a courtyard full of blooming roses.</p>

I imagine that's very different in dath ilan but wanting power except 'I want to study so much magic that lots of people come to my wizard tower to buy magic from me' is....you're almost definitely, if you actually pull it off, going to have - assassinated some people, ordered some children drowned so they won't be competition for your throne..." those are examples from a Taldane history she read this morning.&nbsp; "And I guess you could do that while still intending Good but the sorting doesn't just pay attention to your - self-serving narrative - and if you're killing lots of people to amass power it's almost definitely going to call you Evil.

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Sure. Imagine a small village on a river somewhere, far north with poor farmland, maybe claimed by a distant King but he neither collects taxes nor enforces law so he doesn't feature in this story. In practice, the village is led by a priest of, I dunno, Pharasma, who is the only person in the village with magic; when villagers accuse each other of crimes, he hears them out and fines or punishes the one at fault. He collects a tax from them, for the church, of ten percent of their fields. Then someone's wayward son who went off to be an adventurer comes back, third-circle, capable of impressive things, rich with goods from out of town, and he is welcomed back by his family, until he drunkenly hits someone else in a quarrel over a girl, and kills them because he's an adventurer now and hits harder. And this is brought up before the old priest, and the priest says the adventurer must pay a fine and serve the family of the man he killed at harvest and planting time for ten years, in the place of the laborer he took from them, and the adventurer spits in his face, and then kills him too, and then says 'hey, from now on, I'm the one who will hear out accusations of crime in this village'."</p>

              <p>"I agree that, assuming the villagers let the adventurer get away with that and don't just leave for the afterlife, if one is a fourth-circle cleric, one could perhaps come in and kill the adventurer and get a little sad bit of power.&nbsp; It doesn't - seem like something that <em>scales</em>.&nbsp; The reason it works is that it's isomorphic to a two-player game where one player has all power, and the other player has none but goes along with an unfair division of gains instead of leaving for the afterlife."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>So.</p>
              <p>Their world has people who are more smart or less smart, just like his world.</p>
              <p>Lots of smarter people, however, are out to exploit less smarted people using adversarially selected arguments.</p>
              <p>So the less smarted people have to freeze in place and only believe what they were told by - their parents, Keltham guesses, because even if somebody wandering into the village&nbsp;<em>looks</em> as dumb as you, they could be a smart person faking that.</p>
              <p>Nobody has any Law-inspired concept of validity, or which arguments are admissible or inadmissible, or how to go about constructing a narrower class of arguments that could still contain important stuff while being harder for smarter adversaries to exploit.&nbsp; Their books are endless strings of non-sequiturs and impossible leaps and emotion-invocations, and when your contest of ideas is on that level, there is nothing you can do to stop a clever adversary from doing a search that Goodharts through any flaws or loopholes in the resistance of a dumber argument-considerer.</p>
              <p>...or maybe dath ilan would also be like this, Law or no Law, if not for the Keepers and the fact that the Keepers are, so far as Keltham knows, Good.&nbsp; Just given what's publicly known about talk-control, most dath ilani can little more resist a high-ranked Keeper going all-out on exploiting their own flaws, than a villager of this world could resist the arguments of a wizard, if the villager was foolish enough to hear out a stranger.</p>
              <p>But - what is he supposed to&nbsp;<em>do</em> about that, if that's the case?&nbsp; Even if he can mass-manufacture intelligence headbands they won't change the&nbsp;<em>relative intelligence...</em> well, no, because currently the smartest people&nbsp;<em>get intelligence headbands</em> and the less smart people&nbsp;<em>don't</em> so at the very minimum fixing&nbsp;<em>that</em> would have to shift the equilibrium relative to what it is now...</p>
              <p>"Thanks for my evening update on how awful Golarion is," Keltham says out loud, and not without a certain irony.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Likewise mortal but longer-lived things, a hair closer to ideal agency though still far from it, now battle.</p>
              <p>Their objective: to bring enough pressure to bear on 'Zon-Kuthon outside the vault' that He must choose between being inside that vault and significantly ceasing to be.&nbsp; Maybe not ceasing entirely, but becoming perhaps a fallen being, a mere demigod.&nbsp; He must choose between going into the vault, and that.</p>
              <p>The assembled gods cannot reasonably endeavor to kill all of Zon-Kuthon, if He chooses the latter path.&nbsp; Gods encrypt their energies, arrange their potentials in lattices and arrays to which only they have keys.&nbsp; Like a box full of bouncing classical gas atoms that can be made to all end up on the box's left side, in apparent defiance of thermodynamics and ready to yield up their heat as a pressure, <em>if</em> you know the secret for how those atoms were originally set in motion to be able to end up like that with the right tweak.&nbsp; Anybody who doesn't know the secret just sees a box full of a useless uniform gas.</p>
              <p>In likewise way, a being under such assault as Zon-Kuthon may scatter little shards of Himself here and there, too small and subtle for now to be noticed, but destined to collide and gather up at some future time - a time when His adversaries are paying less attention, no longer spending all Their own power and watchfulness to launch a coordinated assault on Him blanketing Golarion and the other planes where He extends.</p>
              <p>Among the greatest of adventurers who yet do not quite understand, it is whispered that only by killing a great Power within Their own home plane is it possible to destroy that Power permanently; and also that a Power within its home plane is nearly invincible.</p>
              <p>These whispers are not quite accurate.&nbsp; The key concept rather - and from mortals it is hidden - is that gods face a tradeoff between <em>weakness </em>and <em>vulnerability.&nbsp; </em>They can gather themselves up and become stronger, but only at the risk of their own true destruction.&nbsp; Any problem which requires you to become unified and powerful and <em>localized</em>, and therefore <em>vulnerable</em> to any still greater force, is a challenge you should face on your own home ground if you possibly can.&nbsp; On the very rare occasions when Powers are truly slain, therefore, they tend to fall within their home planes, after ascending to terrifying heights within it.</p>
              <p>The assembled gods, then, know that they can only force so much of Zon-Kuthon into the vault prepared for Him.&nbsp; As He could survive as a demigod outside it, He can also go mostly into the vault but leave a demigod's worth of Himself outside.&nbsp; That demigod's worth of power will not be able to free Rovagug, though; and that is all the assembled gods are aiming for.</p>
              <p>Most of them, that is.</p>

              <p>Nethys sees <em>every </em>part of Zon-Kuthon. &nbsp;Nethys knows where <em>every </em>part of Zon-Kuthon is trying to hide.</p>
              <p>Nethys provides those coordinates to Someone Else.</p>
              <p>That's the sort of divine backstab that, if found out, would get every large or obvious remaining piece of Nethys assaulted by more Golarion gods than are currently assaulting Zon-Kuthon.</p>
              <p>The only reason the gods are not <em>currently</em> that scared of Nethys is because it has not, up until now, seemed like Nethys is particularly <em>likely </em>to do that sort of thing - to tattle on gods' secrets to one another, to start wars between Them in which Nethys will pick sides and provide aid, weakening Them until all the gods that Nethys doesn't like, or maybe all the other gods period, have been killed.</p>
              <p>It would not be in Nethys's seeming interests to start down that path, because you can't conceal that sort of thing forever.</p>
              <p>But that logic is not unassailable, and other gods will be watching for early signs.</p>
              <p>Nethys is doing this part anyways.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa finds it hard to think around Keltham.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Not in a stupid romantic way, she doesn't think, though she's aware it's the obvious interpretation. She thinks it's more that - all of her mind has to be pointed at him. She has to be paying attention to the surroundings, the conversation, the connected distant-implications, the opportunities for flirtation, she has to be directing most of her mind at the deception surrounding Keltham and also impress him with the quality of conversation she can generate with the part of her mind that's on him.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>As a result, the sober Carissa diagnosis of what she's like around Keltham is that she's fundamentally reactive. She follows trains of thought of his, she answers his questions. She teases him. She ventures a bit of promising theology, occasionally, if she's feeling bold. But she cannot construct an overarching plan. Which is fine, not that debilitating, it just means she needs one in advance, but tonight has been kind of eventful and the plan she had before they went to practice Keltham's cleric spells is a bit outdated.&nbsp;<br><br>Kissing Keltham leaves more space to think than talking to him does, so she persists in it even once she would ordinarily declare that quite enough kissing.</p>
              <p><br>She wants to convince him to fuck her. She's pretty sure that this is an important step in building intimacy. It involves him trusting her with something, and her demonstrating that trust warranted, and in her not-really-very-professional-judgment it's the best sex act for his kinks, it's about power without obliging him to do a lot of deliberate and constructed&nbsp;<em>making&nbsp;</em>it about power which he's still learning how to do.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She wants to gently introduce, in a testing the waters kind of way, the ideas that 1) some girls are into out-there stuff, Carissa's about&nbsp;<em>average&nbsp;</em>and that means half of girls are kinkier than her, see where that line of thought takes him, 2) power is more interesting when it's not a game nobles play for fun, isn't it and 3) the thing that makes this right is that Keltham wants it and can get it.</p>
              <p>The third one seems hard. She spent a fair share of her beauty appointment playing it in her head with imaginary Keltham.&nbsp;<br><br>"You want it and can get it. <em>That'</em>s what matters, that's why it's all right, it's all right for you to have things, assuming you can get them without breaking the Law."<br><br>Imaginary Keltham: "Right, but the reason the Law doesn't prohibit this is that you also want it. Otherwise it would. If you try to propose a Law that says it doesn't matter what you want then all the people where the Law agrees it doesn't matter what they want would simply overthrow the Law and replace it with a Law who didn't say that, and even if they wouldn't, they could in principle, so the Law can't say that."</p>
              <p>"You want it and can get it. Does it - does it feel like there's something important there? Something that dath ilan would - be missing, if they treated that as sort of a sideshow that gets to rise to relevance only if every other feature of the situation has lined up just right?"<br><br>Imaginary Keltham: Well, it's relevant no matter what, it's just that sometimes the way in which it's relevant is that society should try to have fewer people like me in it, or that it needs to put more emphasis on people not doing things just because they want to.&nbsp;<br><br>"You want it and can get it. That's -&nbsp;<em>itself&nbsp;</em>appealing about you. Maybe that's a very circuitous fetish but it feels very fundamental, to me. The trait that matters in the world is being able to get things you want, and the most romantic situation is being wanted. And that means there's inherently nothing sexier than someone who wants you and can get what he wants."</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>That one feels promising but like it achieves its promisingness by running askew and probably being heresy, again. She still thinks it's a line of argument worth attempting. Maybe you can get someone to 'being willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want is sexy' and then from there to 'being willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want is okay'.&nbsp; She still tries to imagine objections imaginary Keltham might have, but Imaginary Keltham mostly says things like 'math you've never heard of proves that doesn't work', which is a sign she needs to take this problem to Actual Keltham.</p>
              <p>Once she has a plan. Which she doesn't, yet, so. More kissing.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>She likes Keltham. Her thoughts are probably lingering on this because of how she's presently kissing him but it's true, and no doubt there's been at least one agonized meeting over it though somehow no one has reprimanded her, maybe because they know that she really really really does not want to be a statue and even if all the other pillars of her motivational structure grew Keltham-rot inside them - and they haven't - she will still not betray them. She's heard it said - dismissively - that the characteristic female fantasy is that there is a powerful man who could hurt you, but he doesn't. Maybe that's all that it is. But right now, the way that it is is that she likes Keltham, and when he has her in his arms, all her plans maintain only the most tenuous of connections to her, bobbing up and down in the periphery of her mind like a sailor overboard on the high seas, visible for a long time despite being almost immediately beyond rescue.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>....and maybe she should troubleshoot that.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>What are her objectives. First, to get Keltham to feel attached to her. Second, to comprehend him fully in order to build the Evil version of dath ilani thought. Third, stretch goal, seduce him to Evil.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The third one seems tricky right now. That's okay. Carissa's going to be forgiving of herself about that. Other people, too, agree that it seems hard. Keltham is still grappling with ideas like that smarter people might take advantage of less smart ones; this part of the operation is in exploratory mode, right now, and that's all right.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The second one...also seems tricky right now, though more necessary than ever.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Whenever Carissa's around Keltham she gets confused about the nature of Evil. It's because the version she gave him just - fits better into a pathetic human mind? In hindsight it's obvious that trying to destroy the world might seem Good, that Rovagug cultists certainly would be, principled believers that the world should be devoured at their own expense. And the observable fact about the world that almost everyone ends up Evil makes more sense if Evil is about selfishness or lack of altruism than it does with the understanding that Evil is - well, Abrogail Thrune. Carissa is pretty sure this thought will end up in a transcript for Abrogail Thrune tomorrow so hi, Abrogail Thrune, please don't turn me into a statue, Abrogail Thrune, I am suffering in your service very diligently, Abrogail Thrune, but most people are not Abrogail Thrune. Most people are not even weak pale shadows of Abrogail Throne. Tyranny, slavery, pride, contracts - most people kind of just bumble along being weak and pathetic and Carissa is confused about 1) how any of them make Law and 2) how any of them make Evil. She's not worried about herself, personally. She's definitely making progress on Law and she thinks she's made some progress on being genuinely Evil the last two days. She's taking to authority nicely and has lit people on fire when they deserved it and offering to destroy Asmodia's soul in a dark sorcerous rite, if it's not heretical to contemplate, was kind of fun, though also Carissa wants everyone to go to Hell and not get destroyed in sorcerous rites.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(Is that Good? If she wants it in a way that's not about what Asmodeus wants, that's about the sheer horror of their annihilation - it's at the very least the product of a broken mind misunderstanding doctrine. And yet.)</p>
              <p>It hadn't occurred to Asmodia what they had to be trying to do here. But they are going to have to do it, or the mountains of spellsilver will go to everyone and Cheliax won't be uniquely advantaged - might be disadvantaged, even, if their current systems for promoting enough Law and Evil to get their children clear of Abaddon and into Hell stop working on a smarter generation of children - reformulate that to be less pathetic and broken, even if it means it fits less well into her present mind, she doesn't wish to err when she's trying to do strategic planning even if the errors are convenient otherwise, even if she suspects Asmodeus chose her partially for her heresies - Cheliax's current systems get souls to Asmodeus, who wants them; Asmodeus has extended this project resources on the assumption it can get him more souls, or more useful ones, and that's why it ought to do that.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Asmodia is presumably being tortured right now and Carissa hopes she's not useless when she gets back. Maybe it'll be good for her motivation.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The first goal, on the other hand, is going great. Maillol says the things she'd done shouldn't have worked, but they did, and Keltham likes her, and if she only had to accomplish the first goal she'd practically have accomplished it already and she could just keep him interested and roll around on a giant mountain of spellsilver.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Maybe.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Keltham hasn't really hurt Carissa. In a sense, no one has ever really hurt Carissa; she talks a good game but she was careful, in her old life, about which powerful adventurers who could kill her if they were so inclined she climbed up into a Rope Trick with; she mostly went for girls, because whatever Maillol says they are less inclined to hurt you on average though obviously Abrogail Thrune, hi Abrogail Thrune, is entitled to do exactly as she pleases with Carissa including turning her into a statue though Carissa really really hopes that she won't do that because Carissa wants to go to Hell and will make herself very useful to Abrogail Thrune there. If she gets there. Subordinate devils are worth having! Much more useful than statues!</p>
              <p>...anyway Keltham can bite her, and claw at her, but he hasn't for example even looked at the pokers in the fireplace, and he hasn't even asked for tips on the most efficient ways to hurt people without causing damage, and unless you count the cursed Bag of Holding as a sexual experience and plausibly Carissa should she hasn't, actually, been tortured in a sex way, and shouldn't have high confidence in how gracefully she'll handle it except within the bounds of how well she handles it in other contexts. It seems possible she'll like Keltham less once she's taught him how and why to really hurt her. It's possible that whatever switch will flip in her head and he'll be terrifying instead of intriguing, and then everything will just suck.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Which would be good practice for Hell, if so.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>....Carissa thinks that somehow all this thinking is actually making her worse at her job and she should abandon it and go back to not thinking, which was working fine, kind of.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>"It can be different for a woman pestering a man for sex, but only to the extent she has extremely reliable information - which basically means, information directly from him - that he's highly conformant to the masculine 'gendertrope' and that sub-'gendertrope' in particular.&nbsp; I would have provided you with that information just now, when I told you that I was enjoying being asked and saying no."</p>
              <p>(Keltham is just using Baseline 'gendertrope' as a loanword into Taldane, at this point, since the corresponding concept in Taldane simply doesn't exist.)</p>
              <p>"Civilization is all very - structures to make sure that people end up having the power to protect themselves in their sexual relationships, and the realistic ability to decide for themselves without that taking a lot of mental work, and common knowledge that everyone has in fact been trained to protect themselves that way and passed some tests about it, all so that people can be given full <em>responsibility </em>to decide for themselves."</p>
              <p>"So long as you're following those rules, in a world where you know everybody else follows those rules, it means you don't have to worry about them on their behalf, or try to protect them <em>more </em>than they protect themselves, or doubt them when they say yes."</p>
              <p>"The typical dath ilani man - has a great horror of accidentally harming somebody, like that, and the rules are there so they can be less scared after somebody says yes to them."</p>

All right, maybe those women do fine, although in <em>our </em>world that tendency tends to go along with liking pain, because it's not very realistic if he grabs you and is then very gentle and concerned with your pleasure, and it's better if it's realistic. - reportedly, this isn't actually a fetish of mine. I won't object if you jump me without notice sometime but that's because I like you and am a good sport rather than because the possibility of being jumped without notice is specifically thrilling."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham considers explaining the concept of an ero-LARP, much more famous novels deconstructing those ero-LARPs, and ero-LARPs based on novels deconstructing ero-LARPs.</p>
              <p>He considers trying to explain how quantum mechanics is known from experiment and how it in turn implies the many worlds, and what the nature of amplitudes led Civilization to realize about realityfluid, and how all those many worlds must be embedded into a still larger Reality in which the quantum multiverse itself is multiply instantiated.&nbsp; And how, having survived an airplane crash, there is a single obvious wild thought about what must have happened to him, that ending in almost all places he continued on within a remaining and improbable one.&nbsp; If he was a Keeper, probably, Keltham would already know it; for it seems like the sort of thing that must be deducible from first principles if it is true at all, and also, an obvious massive infohazard in ways that Keltham may not have begun to conceive.&nbsp; He's not sure exactly <em>why </em>it will be massively infohazardous <em>but it obviously will be.</em></p>
              <p>And now the place where he finds himself, has people who aren't any plausible equilibrium of selection pressures, but happen to exactly fit the complementary shape of his own unsatisfied and unsatisfiable sexuality; and there's a research group full of girls roughly his age, with himself the sole male among them, and an explicit rationalization for why they all want his seed; and they all have economicmagic and 3-5 of them have fascinating backstories that even Golarion would find surprising; while Nidal invades Cheliax targeting him personally and the godtreaties break down, thereby forcing him to relocate to a new bedroom decorated in doompunk with chains attached to the bed.</p>
              <p>What happens if you perform an evidential update from that, and then predict the future?</p>
              <p>He considers explaining this to somebody who is not going to know, at least until tomorrow, maybe not even for two whole more days, what an evidential update is.</p>
              <p>"Carissa," he says, truly apologetically, "you have not, in fact, ever heard me try to explain any topic that Civilization would consider at all complicated; and this, is a little complicated.&nbsp; I know which concept I'd explain first in the sequence of the explanation, and I was going to do that concept tomorrow, but that sequence goes on for a while."</p>

"Nothing like that. There's a place in Garund where there's a wasteland for hundreds of miles because two ninth-circle wizards fought there, but it isn't actually dangerous to travel through, it's just that magic behaves weirdly and plants mostly don't grow. There's opening something like the Worldwound but Nidal and Cheliax are both Lawful and committed to not doing that, and anyway it's very very difficult and still doesn't just straightforwardly scale up.</p>

              <p>- I would know, I think, if there were something that a reasonable number of people knew about or that had ever in history been used, because people at the Worldwound pay a lot of attention to our options however speculative for closing it.

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham takes a deep breath.</p>
              <p>"So, you've now ever been partially exposed to snippets from the basics of the basics of childhood training for dath ilani, you don't have zero idea of how we see reality.&nbsp; We're used to knowing things <em>legibly.</em>&nbsp; Including places where Golarion might have the idea that it's important for people to obscure things, because you've built a weird not-quite-Lawful thing which requires illegibility to work."</p>
              <p>"Like - bargaining, the way you first described how somebody would do that for my shirt.&nbsp; You can imagine a non-dath-ilani with a shirt thinking 'oh no, I must conceal that the true value of my shirt to me is just a million gold pieces, if they think it's really five million I can get a higher price, if they know it's one million they can just give me an ultimatum to take one million one hundred thousand take it or leave it.&nbsp; A dath ilani wouldn't be scared of things becoming legible, because they have more Lawful approaches that don't disadvantage them in the presence of that legibility; they know the right thing to do is refuse unfair but mutually beneficial trades with very high probability.&nbsp; The real value they put on their shirt isn't a secret for them the way it's a secret for somebody bargaining the usual way for Golarion."</p>
              <p>"I mean, if they were playing by Golarion's rules, they might still try to make the other person think it was five million if that was the game.&nbsp; If it wasn't anything serious like negotiations with Cheliax, I could see myself playing the bargaining game the illegible way if that saved me time explaining things, I'd try to have fun with it even, though I doubt I'd be very good at it on the first try. &nbsp;But I'd have a legible game to fall back on if the illegible game blows up or isn't going my way."</p>
              <p>"If you're used to that being the way things are, trying to play an illegible game with no known legible Law underlying it feels like walking on wet ice... you don't have a lot of ice.&nbsp; Feels unstable, like you're about to put your foot down wrong and fall over, any second.&nbsp; As kids they train us to keep going anyways and parse the universe as we run through it, but that doesn't make illegibility feel safe."</p>
              <p>"There's places even so where Civilization would - give somebody a hug and tell them it was okay to not be totally legible right away.&nbsp; A mother who just gave birth to a child doesn't need to immediately put a value in unskilled-labor-hours on her baby's life, how much she'd pay to avert a 0.1% chance of various bad things happening, any of that.&nbsp; Anybody who burst in and started quizzing her about that would be ejected from the maternity hospital and probably from most of the cities in Civilization."</p>
              <p>"But when Civilization gives someone a hug and tells them it's okay not to make up numbers today, what that relies on,&nbsp;<em>very crucially,</em> is the expectation that the numbers the mom isn't making up and doesn't know to herself <em>are roughly correct numbers</em> in the sense of leading to <em>roughly the same decisions </em>as <em>better numbers would</em>.&nbsp; The reason we give a hug of it's-okay-not-to-be-legible-today to the mom who just gave birth is that, if she did make up numbers about the value of her baby's life to her, they'd be more like four million labor-hours than <em>four </em>labor hours.&nbsp; She's not going to frantically drop her baby in order to save a water-glass from falling and breaking.&nbsp; If you expected her to get decisions like that&nbsp;<em>wrong</em> you'd tell her to make up legible numbers&nbsp;<em>immediately</em> and run them past somebody else."</p>
              <p>"Someone tells me that she's given herself to me, to do with as I want, and if I'd grown up in Golarion we'd probably both be fine from there.&nbsp; But in reality, I'm pretty sure there would be&nbsp;<em>some</em> things I could do that were&nbsp;<em>really not what you had in mind,</em> like, like taking that sharp thing... +3 vicious nasty bigsword, and killing you with it, and then after you're brought back I just kill you again and tell Cheliax not to bring you back that time.&nbsp; That is probably <em>really not what you had in mind,</em> and just to be very clear, it is not what I had in mind either.&nbsp; And you can't spell out things like that for me, my model predicts you replying, because then it's you telling me what I can't do, and contrary to the nature of this thing the way it needs to be.&nbsp; In this case there's no problem, right, because it so happens that I don't want to do that to you, my brain is generating the correct answer despite it being illegal to tell me an underlying Law.&nbsp; But that also means I'm playing an illegible game that has no known legible game behind it, and I feel like I'm walking around on wet ice every time I try to think about moving forward with it, because I did not grow up in Golarion, and I am not confident that the numbers I'm not making up are roughly correct ones."</p>
              <p>"Done."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa finds herself noticing that she shouldn't lie about how her sexuality works because she has no idea what the Second Law of inferring peoples' sexualities does. She assumed Keltham noticed she was faking earlier through training she could learn to subvert but if he's using the Second Law, then the only way out is truth, not necessarily her truth but real truth, the only thing that will have the right truth-properties on the Shadow Plane Of - what did he call them - tropes.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"....part of Chelish dignity is definitely that you only offer deals if you genuinely mean them, that you're not relying on any - altruism or mercy of the other person that was not specified up front. In practice, if you like the sort of things I like, that - kind of means you have to be awfully invincible? Or - mostly I slept with people at the Worldwound where the treaty proscribed them killing or permanently disabling or kidnapping me, and that was enough.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I don't think the core thing that is important to me is being invincible. I think the core thing that is important to me is - not being foolish, and if I assumed there was some safety where there wasn't, then that was foolish,&nbsp;<em>especially&nbsp;</em>across a&nbsp;<em>species gap,&nbsp;</em>so I had to assume there might be none, and it's very satisfying, to be able to assume that.... and another part of it is that something very important to me is being safe. I think part of why I like being hit is that - one way of being safe, right, is to never have bad things happen to you, but another is to never have bad things be bad for you, to transmute them all through arousal and the admiration of others and sheer determination into something that you're good at, and prized for. I feel safer when someone is hitting me than I ever feel otherwise, because I know I can handle something I didn't previously know I could. You could drive a sword through me, no one would stop you, but I'm safe even if you do, so I'm not scared....I don't know if I'm making sense." She's not lying, though.</p>

              <p>His last memories say that somebody hit him with a Suffocation spell, a caster powerful enough that Maillol went unconscious almost immediately, and unconscious is not a good place to be in the middle of a Nidal assault even if the spell doesn't just kill you.&nbsp; Maillol didn't particularly expect to survive, to be clear, and burned all his negative channelings almost immediately; he wasn't expecting combat that day and hadn't requested spells accordingly.</p>
              <p>Maillol lives and pulls himself together, fast enough you might not notice it, and requests a situation update.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Our Lord is at war with Zon-Kuthon," the briefing begins, "and Cheliax is at war with Nidal. Keltham is alive. Sevar is alive and has project command, though she delegated most project decisions to you anticipating your immediate return. Otolmens' oracle is alive. Keltham, Sevar, and Otolmens' oracle have been relocated to the palace on Her Majesty's orders; Sevar is presently chained up in Keltham's bed, having had a conversation with him in which she told him that what he desires is a romantic relationship in which she belongs to him, he worried she did not mean he could murder her, she insisted she did mean that, and he decided to trust her and try doing whatever he wants, which seems to be cuddling. Project casualties are in your briefing notes, they're in line for resurrection; we're seeing high casualties on the border, so those resurrections may be slow at their present prioritization.</p>
              <p>Pilar, the oracle of Cayden Cailean, somehow accompanied Keltham to his spell testing and out of the villa for the summons, and then took a sword for him; she's higher priority for resurrection because we're both worried we might lose her - she's in Elysium - and because we need to ask her what the fuck happened. Asmodia is also dead, confirmed in Hell, lower priority; Ione is not conscious and may not, given the vision was likely from Nethys, recover consciousness. The villa has just been determined clear of hostiles and traps and not yet evaluated for Kuthite magic items for divination or espionage. Keltham is suspicious about the destruction of his notes, which happened when the Kuthites swarmed the villa, and about the fact that the invasion was obviously timed to his stepping outside the villa and yet the invaders didn't seem to immediately know where he was. We have no explanation for this. He's requested we ensure there are no secret Kuthites on staff; we're pretty damn sure, obviously, but if there's anyone who could plausibly have evaded recent evaluation, haul them in. He's also suspicious that Security didn't teleport him out; we determined that staff member used his Teleports earlier in the day fetching requisitions from a supply depot in Corentyn, and that despite this he was selected to accompany Keltham out of the villa because he passed muster to Detect Anxieties and Detect Desires when most didn't, but if anything about that seems odd to you, we can raise his priority for resurrection as well, or if he refuses it contact his owner in Hell."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>In the depths of the center of the Palace in Egorian, there is a chamber that sees unfortunately frequent use.&nbsp; The queen sits on a stepped dais high enough that her own head will not be below that of the crouching form of Gorthoklek the pit fiend, which, even with Gorthoklek crouching, requires quite the high dais.&nbsp; Across from Gorthoklek also stands Contessa Lrilatha in full and deadly panoply.</p>
              <p>Before the dais stands one other.</p>
              <p>The most important purpose of this chamber is to, when it becomes necessary, hold an intervention.</p>
              <p>"You," Abrogail Thrune declares coldy, imperiously, a voice like a twisting dagger, "are a greater disappointment to me than perhaps any other being or happening in my life."</p>
              <p>"The feeling is mutual," says one of the three entities in Cheliax who would dare say such a thing.</p>
              <p>"I can remember as though it were yesterday, my excitement when I learned that Asmodeus had sent me my own personal erinyes to tempt me and corrupt me.&nbsp; What poisonous words does she now whisper in my ears?&nbsp; Restrain my cruelty.&nbsp; Restrain my lust.&nbsp; I must control my desires and not let my desires control me.&nbsp; I have been assigned my own personal black-winged monk of Irori."</p>
              <p>"Irori is Lawful Neutral," observes the same entity who spoke before, Contessa Lrilatha.&nbsp; "Asmodeus is Lawful Evil.&nbsp; Need I spell out in greater detail what the two have in common?&nbsp; Imagine my own disappointment when, hoping I had been assigned an eager pupil to corrupt further, I found myself instead tasked to restrain an incipient drow queen."</p>
              <p>"Drow queen.&nbsp; What a tempting thought.&nbsp; They, one hears, are allowed to have fun."</p>
              <p>Aspexia Rugatonn speaks then, weary, dry, from where she stands before the dais, facing down the Queen with the other two sensible beings in Cheliax.&nbsp; "You are allowed to have fun.&nbsp; You are allowed to have other fun.&nbsp; Find different fun."</p>
              <p>"I don't want different fun.&nbsp; I want to turn Sevar into a statue.&nbsp; I really, really want to turn Sevar into a statue."</p>
              <p>"I really, really want to dissolve you in acid but you don't hear me being a whinecomplainbitch* about it."&nbsp; (This word of Infernal now appears as a loanword in the Chelish dialect of Taldane.)</p>
              <p>"I want to petrify her slowly, so that she can feel it happening, and scream with all of her heart and all of her soul while it's happening, and release all of that terror, and tension, and everything inside her, and I want to kiss her gently while she's turning to stone and screaming. &nbsp;She's just so <em>scared</em>, and I so rarely meet anyone who's that scared... well, anyone interesting to me who's that scared of me personally doing something that it would interest me to do to them."</p>
              <p>Even hunched over, with its wings folded, the black figure is taller than a man standing on another man's shoulders. &nbsp;"I expect that our Lord would be most extremely displeased," rumbles Gorthoklek.</p>
              <p>"I would, of course, unpetrify her immediately afterwards; and swear then never to do that to her in truth, unless she had betrayed the House of Thrune knowingly, deliberately, and unambiguously."</p>
              <p>Gorthoklek and Contessa Lrilatha both pass their Bluff checks against the queen; Aspexia Rugatonn, who is not specialized in Splendour in quite the same way, does not.&nbsp; The brief break in the room's atmosphere is therefore, however finely, noticeable.</p>
              <p>"What," says Abrogail.&nbsp; "Did you actually believe that I would actually bury her?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; <em>Really?</em>&nbsp; After having known me this long, you still think I would do that?"</p>
              <p>"Yes," say three of the four most powerful beings in Cheliax in unison.</p>
              <p>"Perhaps I would if Asmodeus had not singled her out and if she were not performing vital work for Cheliax.&nbsp; But, that being so, do you truly believe I would affront Asmodeus's purpose and interests so, when I could have most of the fun I wanted without the cost to Hell?&nbsp; You should know, given the consequences to me, and how those have not yet been invoked, that I have never once betrayed Asmodeus in the depths of my own heart."</p>
              <p>"The trouble is what the depths of your own heart seem to define as a betrayal of Asmodeus," rumbles Gorthoklek.&nbsp; "The depths of your own heart seem astonishingly permissive about it."</p>
              <p>"Oh?&nbsp; How misfortunate.&nbsp; The devil negotiating my pact on behalf of Asmodeus should have defined that term more carefully."</p>
              <p>Mortal humans being what they are, one would have expected this clause of the contract to come into force within days of the pact being signed and possibly the first minute.&nbsp; No matter how lax or unspoken the definition, no matter how the mortal drove themselves half-mad trying to avoid that, it should have triggered <em>anyways.</em>&nbsp; The resulting penalty clauses do not nullify the compact, but produce a less stringent interpretation of Hell's side and a more stringent interpretation of Abrogail Thrune's.</p>
              <p>Given that it hasn't triggered, the devil who negotiated that compact is not having a good century.&nbsp; It isn't that Asmodeus hasn't benefited from the pact, or that Asmodeus isn't receiving enough of a share of the gains, or even that He is displeased with the results, <em>it's the principle of the thing.</em></p>
              <p>Abrogail Thrune has never once spoken aloud what it meant to her when she signed her compact, to not betray Asmodeus in the depths of her own heart, lest anyone use that knowledge against her. &nbsp;It is simply this: she gets to have her fun, and Asmodeus gets to have His.</p>
              <p>"You know as well as I do that it would be good for her," says Abrogail Thrune. "It would be so, <em>so</em> good for her."</p>
              <p>"We are not <em>here </em>to do what is good for Sevar," says Aspexia Rugatonn.&nbsp; "We were explicitly instructed <em>not to be proactive about her correction.</em>"</p>
              <p>"You were.&nbsp; I was not.&nbsp; Asmodeus cannot have failed to predict that she would catch my interest."</p>
              <p>"He most certainly <em>can </em>have failed to predict it. &nbsp;He can have failed to predict that Hell's exact wording would leave you a loophole, and a rather arguable loophole at that. &nbsp;Our Lord has other things on His mind and cannot devote all of His attention to Cheliax.&nbsp; Complications like these, which require more of His attention, are <em>already </em>injuries and expenses to Him.&nbsp; And <em>now,</em> of all times, He is gravely distracted, and may not see what is happening here at all."</p>
              <p>For all her Splendour bonuses, Abrogail can't compete with Aspexia for sternness, but neither is she that easily swayed from her desires. &nbsp;"You may recall that when I was negotiating with your Lord's agent to take this throne in the first place, there is a specific clause I added to the effect that His high priests would not tell me to never have any fun.&nbsp; Keep to your Lord's bargain, Aspexia."</p>
              <p>"Operative word <em>never</em>," Aspexia says sharply. &nbsp;"I've accepted you turning good Asmodeans into statues and burying them, because most souls are of little importance to our Lord, because there could be a discipline problem otherwise among those who truly look forward to Hell. &nbsp;You may continue to have that fun in the future. &nbsp;<em>This </em>soul is of importance to our Lord <em>and </em>to your country of Cheliax <em>and </em>to our Lord's longer purposes in Golarion.&nbsp; <em>Otolmens has appointed an oracle.&nbsp; The gods are at war.</em>&nbsp; You need to <em>stop introducing complications</em>."</p>
              <p>"Unfortunately, as I do now admit, I did not realize, on first meeting Sevar, the effect my threat would have on her; and that, I do worry, may be a complication.&nbsp; The transcripts of her thoughts show that, despite my attempted reassurance, she continues to be distracted by thoughts of me doing terrifying things to her.&nbsp; So now I have to actually do them to her.&nbsp; Slowly.&nbsp; It's the only way to undo my own past folly."</p>
              <p>"Hardly the only way," observes the most actually intelligent entity in the room, in a low grumbling growl, though this level of Intelligence is not required to see the obvious. "You could swear to Sevar the same oath, without first pretending to turn her into a statue."</p>
              <p>"<em>But then I would never get to slowly petrify her!</em>"</p>
              <p>"Why have our existences become this?" wonders Contessa Lrilatha on a more private channel.&nbsp; "How did we offend our Lord?&nbsp; Will we ever be allowed to return to Hell?"</p>
              <p>Gorthoklek replies with a brief proverb in Infernal.&nbsp; It carries with it the sense of 'Hell is other people', of 'This is Hell nor are we out of it', of 'Hell is not a place but a philosophy', but the literal Infernal is simply 'Hell is the destruction of hope.'</p>

              <p>Pilar Pineda has been in Elysium longer than Hell thinks.&nbsp; Not nearly long enough to get the full tour, but enough to be shown around a little, appropriately attired and appropriately treated, to see massive crystal-waterfalls in which glasslike material flows slowly down from what look like leagues and leagues up, to sleep briefly but refreshingly in a warm cavern lit by glowing edible moss, to meet interesting people and be mistreated by them in interesting ways.</p>
              <p>Long enough to be told what Elysium believes about what Hell really is, how Hell really works, and have it sworn to her in the name of Good and Chaos that they're telling the truth to the best of their own knowledge.&nbsp; They're not Lawful, yes, but it doesn't mean they're all liars, all the time.&nbsp; There are beings with spell-like abilities here to rival great wizards, and one shows Pilar a glimpse of Hell as it really is.</p>
              <p>To be clear, Pilar hasn't been here <em>that</em> long; this tour is being done in something of a rush.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham wakes, to light just beginning to filter in through the bedroom window.&nbsp; He is not used to sleeping through any more light than that, and, what with all the distractions, didn't even close the curtains before falling asleep cuddling a chained-up Carissa.</p>
              <p>Oh.</p>
              <p>He&nbsp;<em>can</em> sleep on the same surface, and even in the same poorly designed bed, as someone else.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; He can do that with Carissa; he doesn't particularly like the thought of doing it with anyone else that he currently knows.</p>
              <p>It's raining outside, moderately windy.&nbsp; It's not possible to see, underneath the clouds, if the sky is doing anything weird.</p>
              <p>Keltham starts to get the - key, how is&nbsp;<em>that</em> a key, he didn't want to interrupt sexytimes to ask Carissa this, last night, but <em>you can literally just look at it and see how it must fit into the lock.</em>&nbsp; Why couldn't you just look at the shape and remember it, and then make another key like that, if you'd trained yourself a bit on fast memorization?&nbsp; Golarion really doesn't make much sense... well, maybe only sexy keys for bed chains are like this, because the person is chained up and it doesn't matter if they can remember the key's shape.</p>
              <p>He's carefully unlocking the keys before it occurs to him to wonder whether he actually wants to Carissa let out; after a few moments, he concludes that he doesn't want to do more - well, maybe he would, if he thought of things to do - but if he wasn't pushing himself into things -</p>
              <p>Keltham realizes he's being dumb; he knows how to think better than this, in familiar domains, knows that the Way there is not to question your ordinary wants so much except on rare special occasions of deliberate meta.&nbsp; He felt like letting Carissa out of the chains, so he's going to do that and not trip over questioning the impulse.&nbsp; If he made the wrong decision somehow by acting on that impulse, he'll find out and his brain will update its impulses.&nbsp; Besides, if he wants Carissa back in the chains, he can always put her back in them later.</p>
              <p>(A strange wash of warmth at that final thought, unfamiliar, but becoming quickly less so.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Thank you," Keltham says in Taldane, and tries running through some words in his mind.&nbsp; It's harder to read the faint connotations than it was yesterday; Share Language doesn't want to override knowledge that you already have.&nbsp; Keltham has to focus hard on the internal probes and use some dath ilani techniques for hunting down subtle connotations that words and concepts have to you.</p>
              <p>'Lawful' is obsessing over your city's regulations and fretting over whether you're conforming enough to all of them, 'Chaos' is insanity, 'Good' is something put firmly underneath a sense of superiority that's alien to dath ilan, 'Evil' is being mean to people and not in a sexually sadistic way either.</p>
              <p>Keltham makes a note not to trust this particular person with anything if he can avoid it.&nbsp; Actually, he should check -</p>
              <p>'Asmodeus' doesn't return anything, nor 'Zon-Kuthon'.&nbsp; Somehow the spell knows that these are individual things rather than general concepts, no matter how much a dath ilani would say that no such qualitative difference exists, and isn't transferring them over as Shared Language.</p>
              <p>Keltham supposes that would have been an overly easy way of identifying traitors, at least those at or above second-circle wizardry... no, that's trope-based thinking, and it is very far from certain that mode of thinking binds to reality here at all; so he needs to at least firmly <em>label</em> every use of it in an inference step, and then compute everything the other way too.&nbsp; If this technique is not forbidden to work by tropes, Keltham should be creative about making this method work, or just literally continue at all to think about how to make it work.</p>
              <p>'Pain'?&nbsp; Keltham can't get a read on it, he has a Baseline concept that the Taldane word maps onto almost exactly; Keltham already knows what this word means.&nbsp; This sort of outcome is presumably the reason why Golarion folks don't think of this as a standard probe to use on each other.</p>
              <p>Dath ilani however do not have a single commonly-used concept that corresponds exactly to the connotations and meanings of the Taldane word 'torture'*, and Keltham can get something of a read on that; 'torture' sounds awfulscary rather than desirable.</p>
              <p>Okay, probably not a Kuthite traitor then, to the extent this method works at all.<br><br></p>
              <p>(*) &nbsp;The Baseline compound phrase that refers-by-convention to 'deliberately inflicting extreme amounts of pain' carries primarily the connotation of overly large negative payoffs in decision matrices and edgelord thought experiments devised by teenage males, not the idea that you can obtain information or obedience that way.<br><br></p>
              <p>(From the perspective of anybody watching, Keltham just said 'Thank you', closed the door, and then shut his eyes and stood motionless for about a minute.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Abadar is (a) busy (b) very confused about how His attempts to help the strange squirrel via spell choice have been playing out so far and (c) feeling somewhat more relaxed about His initial attempt to open trade with the squirrel in a way nonharmful to the squirrel's own interests, now that the consequences will include the downfall of Zon-Kuthon.&nbsp; If the squirrel is Good, which it might possibly be to some degree, it'll probably feel sad about how this whole business ended up helping Cheliax; but having also helped cause the downfall of Zon-Kuthon should make up for a lot, relative to what a Good squirrel's interests probably are.&nbsp; And if the squirrel isn't Good at all, the squirrel is even less likely in those branches to regret having ever tried to trade with Abadar.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Pilar Pineda wakes in the dawn light of Elysium, still immersed in the pool of glowing slimes where she was resting that night. It seems that she is no longer chained, no longer bears those marks that tell Elysians how to mistreat her.&nbsp; She is as naked, now, as when she first appeared here; though the pool slimes would be protecting her modesty if Asmodean wizard students were allowed to retain any.</p>
              <p>Standing before her is the bizarre, brightly colored, un-reality-resembling form of Cayden Cailean's - herald?&nbsp; Delegate?&nbsp; It's not clear what she is in many senses, just that she (or is it She?) obeys, or, as the locals would have it, 'works with', Cayden Cailean.</p>
              <p>Pilar knows, even before She speaks, what She will say.</p>
              <p>"They'll call you very soon," says She to Pilar.&nbsp; "Are you still sure you want to go back?"</p>
              <p>"Yes I am sure," Pilar says firmly.&nbsp; "And, if it's in any way possible, I don't want to come here next time.&nbsp; Even if I can't get Maledicted in time, don't take me here again, just let me get my proper trial from Pharasma.&nbsp; I belong in Hell.&nbsp; And yes, I know that when I'm in Hell, I'll many times wish I was here.&nbsp; But I'm <em>actually</em> Lawful Evil, and this was a lovely place to visit, but it's not where I belong."</p>
              <p>The strange being nods Her head.&nbsp; "Okay."</p>
              <p>Pilar was expecting more of an argument.&nbsp; "Okay?" she repeats.</p>
              <p>"An it harm none other, do as ye will!&nbsp; It may not be the whole of the Law, but it sure is a great big part of Chaotic Good!&nbsp; We're not going to keep you here if <em>you</em> say you'd rather be somewhere else."</p>
              <p>From far away, Pilar hears the call. &nbsp;<em>Yes, </em>she answers, with her mind, with her soul, and a majority if not the absolute entirety of her heart.&nbsp; <em>Yes, I want to go back. &nbsp;To serve Asmodeus in Golarion, and then in Hell.</em></p>
              <p>And she feels herself start to fade.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She's fading really very slowly, for some reason, and seems to basically be still here.</p>
              <p>"Time is running super fast for us right now, relative to Golarion," says the strange being.&nbsp; "I am willing that it be so.&nbsp; Raise Dead takes a minute to cast, and it turns out, there's a few more things you need to hear before you go!"</p>
              <p>"Is this where you spring some sort of Chaotic Good trap on me?" Pilar says suspiciously.</p>
              <p>"No.&nbsp; It's where I tell you that&nbsp;Cayden Cailean <em>won't </em>be able to take you, if you die for real.&nbsp; He was only able to get away with this <em>because</em> you were going to go back and Cayden Cailean knew that.&nbsp; You're right, Lawful Evil to Chaotic Good is something of a stretch.&nbsp; We could arrange a visit, but we can't offer you citizenship, not really."</p>
              <p>Pilar now has additional questions.&nbsp; "Wait - if I could never stay here in the first place, why did you keep asking me if I really wanted to go back to Golarion and go on to Hell - why send me on this whole tour to convince me to say no to the Raise Dead -"</p>
              <p>The strange being laughs Her strange high-pitched cheerful laugh.&nbsp; "Well, because it was important that you knew for yourself, you see!&nbsp; There's not many people who can go to Hell with a whole heart, or who really and truly want to belong to Asmodeus when Asmodeus cares so little about them.&nbsp; Many, many, many fewer people than have convinced themselves that they're okay with it."&nbsp; The strange being looks sad, now.&nbsp; "Not many people in Cheliax would make the decision you just did, if they had really been to Elysium, and if they really thought they could stay.&nbsp; If Asmodeus's followers had any sense they'd throw you a huge party about it, when you got back to Golarion, but they won't do that either.&nbsp; Most of them won't want to admit, if they even let themselves know it, that they would never do what you did."</p>
              <p>On reflection, the Elysians never once did tell her explicitly that she could stay, just kept on asking her if she was <em>sure </em>she wanted to go back.&nbsp; "What in the name of Asmodeus... um.&nbsp; What is Cayden Cailean&nbsp;<em>planning?</em>&nbsp; Why&nbsp;<em>do</em> that?"&nbsp; She doesn't expect them to just actually tell her, but, Chaotic Good outsider, she should at least try.</p>
              <p>"You don't think it's just the sort of thing that Chaotic Good people do?"</p>
              <p>"No," says Pilar.&nbsp; "This is way, waaay, <em>waaaay</em> too much effort for just getting one Asmodean to know for certain that she's an Asmodean, when, in fact, she already knew that."&nbsp; (Elysium has affected her speech patterns, Pilar notes, she'd better watch that when she gets back.)</p>
              <p>"Did she really know it, though?&nbsp; There'd be an awful lot of Asmodeans who said they were certain they were Asmodeans, who'd never let themselves think that wasn't true.&nbsp; But if they were in Elysium and had the chance to stay, they'd say yes in a heartbeat.&nbsp; Could you know you weren't one of those, if you hadn't really tried it?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, I could, actually," Pilar says.&nbsp; "But more importantly, that is not the whole point of this operation.&nbsp; What is?"</p>
              <p>The strange being slyly winks one of the inhumanly huge, luminous white-black-blue-white eyes in Her head.&nbsp; "Well, <em>that </em>would be telling.&nbsp; But, guess what - the part where Cayden Cailean turned you into His oracle is going to help Asmodeus, in the end!"</p>
              <p>"<em>Really.</em>"</p>
              <p>"Really!&nbsp; You're truly loyal to Asmodeus, Pilar.&nbsp; I'm not going to say we'd <em>never</em> use somebody like you against her own god, but it's still the sort of thing that Good prefers not to do.&nbsp; According to Asmodeus's own values, He'll be better off in the world where Pilar Pineda became an oracle of Cayden Cailean than in the world where you didn't.&nbsp; Obviously that's not the real point from Cayden Cailean's perspective, but it still happens to be true."</p>
              <p>Chaotic Good and Lawful Evil don't have a whole lot of common interests, but they do have some.&nbsp; "...Is this about keeping Rovagug sealed, or the Worldwound, or something?"</p>
              <p>"One of those three for sure!"</p>
              <p>Pilar can feel herself to have almost entirely faded, now.&nbsp; Golarion is calling her, it's not her home, but it's on her way.</p>
              <p>"And maybe it's not the real point either," says the un-reality-looking bright-pink sort-of-horse, "but with so many people in Hell, who don't want to be there, it would be sad if one of the very few people who did want to be there, couldn't go.&nbsp; Asmodeus isn't a friend to anyone, but that doesn't mean He doesn't need anyone to be a friend to Him.&nbsp; After all, sometimes -"</p>
              <p>Pilar hears the last words with her soul's mind more than her soul's ears.</p>
              <p><em>"-&nbsp;friendship can be the greatest magic of all!"</em></p>

              <p>Pilar's back, carrying a story that got her instantly kicked to the almost-but-not-quite-absolute-top-priority line to talk to Aspexia Rugatonn, which is, unfortunately, a pretty long line while the gods are at war.</p>
              <p>Sevar&nbsp;<em>is unfortunately the expert</em> on whatever the <em>Abyss</em>&nbsp;this Second Law business is about.&nbsp; Maillol can <em>barely</em> understand any of the game Sevar is playing against Keltham's mastery of the Law he's already lectured on.&nbsp; If it wasn't for Sevar's thought transcripts, nobody else reading the surface conversation would've realized that there was a great mystery here in the first place.</p>
              <p>Still, even with everyone incredibly busy, there's probably <em>somebody</em> here in the palace who can beat Keltham's Will save on Detect Thoughts with enough reliability to make it worth the risk.&nbsp; Though they should probably ready a story about Nidal infiltrators in case that person fucks up.</p>
              <p>Anyways, Maillol can't think of anything besides sending in somebody to ask Keltham why he thinks one girl is a hidden Kuthite cleric, and hoping that makes him think about the Second Law.&nbsp; Maybe have somebody go in who's old and impressive-looking and wearing a big visible intelligence headband so that Keltham is more likely to try to explain to them than to Sevar.&nbsp; All they need is for one of Cheliax's three eighth-circle wizards to have the time available for a Detect Thoughts.&nbsp; During a war with Nidal.&nbsp; Well, there's also always Aspexia Rugatonn, it's not like she'd be busy.&nbsp; Or Gorthoklek, as the general of Cheliax's armies this must be like a vacation for him.</p>

              <p>"There's been a suggestion to have a third party tell Keltham useful things about your sexuality, preferably true ones, that he might be hesitant to believe from you directly.&nbsp; Such as that you are attracted to him in part because of the actual power he holds over you, in the sense that you know Cheliax would let him do anything to you if he made that a condition of cooperating with us, and that if he never exercises any power over you, you may lose some interest.&nbsp; Supposedly we know how you work because people with lots of experience with submissives can guess that by looking closely at you and how you behave around Keltham, as some people in our 'Governance' are of course doing in the background.&nbsp; That Cheliax would let him do anything he wanted would be true in every sane country in the world and Taldor specifically and therefore, goes the argument, passes your condition on how we tell him Cheliax works."</p>

Another option, because I think he's going to want to talk about exclusivity in a little while, is to have someone drop in and ask him if they can rent me, and give a justification along these lines." Carissa has a hard time pinning down a lot of her intuitions about Keltham but she expects that he will have some kind of feelings about 'look, she's into stuff that's much more serious than you are prepared to offer', and if that take is given by someone with an obvious self-interest then it's also easier if it's disastrous for him to reject it without reaching any far-reaching conclusions about Cheliax. Also, whether he ends up agreeing or not he'll end up wanting to learn the skills he doesn't have, and also it seems like fertile territory for 'things he might turn out to be into'.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Then Keltham attempts to think for a bit, his thoughts tentatively trying out a review of recent events, before he concludes that in fact he shouldn't do that and should try to decompress more instead, while he's alone by himself in the quiet but for the sound of rain outside.</p>
              <p>He'll&nbsp;poke through the fourteen-volume history on 'Absalom', which becomes more interesting after it becomes clear that Absalom is where the Starstone resides.&nbsp; The quality of the reasoning in the history books is something like six times better than those of the books in the villa library, more like 1 reasoning error per 2 sentences instead of 3 reasoning errors per 1 sentence.</p>
              <p>...is that because the palace can afford better books than - but why - why would - <em>books, information,</em> you should just be able to reprint the best versions of things if the information&nbsp;<em>exists</em> - do more intelligent authors demand incredibly high book royalties to the point where most people can't afford good information about basic subjects?&nbsp; Golarion <em>why.</em></p>
              <p>The book's contents seem to be dated to before Aroden died, which, if Keltham is recalling correctly, was a century ago.&nbsp; Maybe that's <em>at least </em>how long it took for the slightly smarter and better-reasoned book to have its copyright decay to where it could sell enough copies to be worth printing?&nbsp; Golarion, again, <em>why</em>?&nbsp; Information is very easy to copy once it exists; information on core topics is among the most blatant possible cases where Civilization has an interest in everybody being able to afford it.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham is a bit startled that Carissa would just&nbsp;<em>tell&nbsp;</em>him that Pilar ended up in Elysium.&nbsp; That should've been something he had to figure out on his own by talking to Pilar, or investigating her, or something.&nbsp; Pilar should've been left more mysterious than that until their first date, or until he did something to appeal to her, if those tropes were governing here.&nbsp; Call it maybe 6 times as likely on the theory 'Chelish Governance asked Pilar "what" and found out a weird thing and promptly and sensibly told Carissa so she could tell me' as on the theory 'this is an ero-LARP'.&nbsp; With possible amendments if the Chaotic Good thing turns out to be itself much more mysterious; but still, Keltham making the first discovery that starts the mystery trail should require that he start Pilar's route, like, at all?&nbsp; Or maybe that happened when she took a +3 vicious nasty bigsword for him.</p>
              <p>But still a surprise, not advance-predicted, not the main thing the theory obviously says.&nbsp; You don't want to rationalize those out the window.&nbsp; Maybe call it 3:1 instead of 6:1, though.</p>
              <p>"Well, huh," Keltham says, "the details there would be a bit hard to explain, but that's some small evidence against the reasoning system I was using to infer that one of the girls is a secret Zon-Kuthon cleric, or that one of the more unusual girls in class will have the 'being-forced' fetish.&nbsp; Not decisive or anything, but noticeable jolt.&nbsp; The key is knowing how to keep track of that sort of thing over time, which is what I'd otherwise have planned to lecture on next, the Law for accumulating pieces of evidence that aren't individually decisive, until they add up to something."</p>
              <p>"Asmodia's going to - end up pretty behind, in a week, at the rate we were going.&nbsp; I'm not sure how much you can recover from that sort of thing by reading notes, in a situation like this one... well, maybe somebody else could teach Asmodia, to help solidify the material in their own minds by teaching it, that's a big part of the reason why older kids teach younger ones in dath ilan.&nbsp; Still, that'd be a big chunk of someone's time.&nbsp; Depending on how expensive a seventh-circle Regenerate is... well, except that they are going to do it at all, eventually, so we're not paying from zero.&nbsp; I probably want to expend some political capital on it happening <em>earlier,</em> if the project is considered competitive with war demands at all."</p>
              <p>"I&nbsp;<em>could</em> teach a class today, for sure.&nbsp; Whether I <em>should</em>... maybe not so much, if the view-from-above says that somebody in my position is supposed to take one day off, and it probably does."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>- telling Keltham about Pilar was a correct move in the Second Law game. Okay. Carissa doesn't understand why and would REALLY LIKE someone to read Keltham's thoughts and try to get more but it's - information, and as Keltham says, you can use a little of that at a time. "It might literally be cheaper to pass Asmodia a two-way mirror in Hell so she can keep up," she says. "But I think it's reasonable to press them on getting her back sooner."</p>

              <p>Though Ione might be less likely than some, but no; for purposes of deciding whether it's okay to <em>risk having kids</em>, he needs to assume that Ione is scripted - by Governance, not by some metalevel eroLARP - and can't be trusted either.</p>

              <p>"Or actually - potentially simpler solutions.&nbsp; Is there a fourth-circle or lower spell I can ask my god to give me, that would let me create a small object that isn't as fragile as Prestidigitating that, and can have properties like, impermeability to fluid, adhesion to skin until dispelled."</p>

              <p>"If you Alter Self immediately after sex, then shift back, would I be able to check inside you and verify that the semen had vanished?&nbsp; Maybe I'd be willing to try for the further trust in that case, that semen doesn't persist in a vagina or uterus that you don't have... actually no, shit, I can't rely on that, because you could also produce that result with Prestidigitation even if it wouldn't ordinarily happen from Alter Self.&nbsp; No wait, counter-2-arguendo, if you can cast Alter Self and come back fast enough, I can have Detect Magic running the whole time, check your vaginal contents before and after, and verify that Alter Self was the only magic to affect you over that period..."</p>
              <p>This is actually kind of fascinating, as Compounding Capabilities problems go.&nbsp; Maybe the eroLARP is deconstructing a computer game where the player needed to drag the spells from a list of available spells to form the correct structure to eliminate a pregnancy, before they could fuck anybody.&nbsp; That sounds like how a computer-game version of an eroLARP would work.</p>

              <p>One also needs to consider that, at a sufficient level of magical power and ill intent, they could have done something clever when he had sex with Carissa the previous day, quickly moving semen from her mouth to her vagina, maybe as screened by an illusion.&nbsp; Heck, they could've teleported sperm right out of his epididymis while he was sleeping in the villa the first night, before the Forbiddance went up - though they'd also have to mix it with seminal fluid to have a chance for the sperm to survive a uterus.</p>

Different flavor. ...also I think some people experience failures of will, about obeying an order like that for weeks or months, especially if you're messing with them around it enough, so maybe they actually do have to worry about breaking a rule even though they didn't mean to. I have never tried anything like this before so I shouldn't think too highly of myself but I&nbsp;<em>think&nbsp;</em>there's no order up to and including 'stick your hand in that fire and keep it there' I'd just disobey without warning you first that it was proving too difficult; if I would, then I'm just pretending, and I don't want to be just pretending."</p>

              <p>He forces himself to face the scary thing instead; it doesn't pay to do that all day long, but he's had relatively few shocking revelations today.</p>
              <p>"I don't know whether I'm more frightened-intrigued by the notion of you wanting to make it <em>impossible </em>to disobey orders, or the amount by which you're trying to hand me the total keys to your sexuality, but both of those things feel like they're a step too far for me to do this minute, and I need to let it sink in for an hour without forcing it -"</p>
              <p>"My mind is imagining you struggling inside the chains and not being able to get out, though, and it thinks that's very sexy, much more sexy than just being chained up at all -"</p>
              <p>"I'm sorry.&nbsp; I need to hear you tell me that's okay, if and only if that actually is okay, obviously, I'm not asking you to send a false signal, but even after hearing you say it's fine to kill you, my brain still wants to hear you say whether or not it's okay that I'd see you struggling to get out of the chains and not let you out."</p>
              <p>It really feels like this is a situation that <em>demands</em> the ability to talk in metalanguage and say 'dequote'; but Carissa keeps on seeming to reject, not so much that specific proposal, as the entire framework of thought that would want to hear about it.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I hate Chaotic Good," Aspexia Rugatonn says, her voice sounding reflective and her face as impassive as always.&nbsp; She looks up from the papers in her hand, having just finished reviewing a transcript of Pilar's report on her involuntary tour of Elysium.&nbsp; "I hate, hate, hate Chaotic Good.&nbsp; If hatred were diamonds I could take my hatred of Chaotic Good and cast Miracle with it and have enough left over for a thousand Resurrections.&nbsp; I would, personally, rather go to Abaddon than Elysium."</p>
              <p><br>Pilar Pineda swallows.&nbsp; "Grand High Priestess - is this one permitted to ask -"</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Just speak your thoughts, Pineda.&nbsp; I can hear them anyways."</p>
              <p><br>"I was confused by the Chaotic Good outsider's claim that it served Asmodeus's interests for Cayden Cailean to do what He did to me.&nbsp; I wonder if - if you think they're telling the truth, that I am not meant to be - harmful to our Lord -"</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You don't conclude that I believe they were telling the truth, from the fact that you're still alive?"</p>
              <p><br>No because the Grand High Priestess could be unsure and wanting to keep her options open, or because she could have some cunning counterplot of her own to whatever it is that Cayden Cailean is trying to do -</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are correct that I'm unsure," the Grand High Priestess answers her unspoken thought.&nbsp; "But while Chaotic Good is not Lawful Good, under those circumstances and speaking to someone like you, it is unfortunately plausible that they would tell the truth."</p>
              <p><br><em>Unfortunately?</em> Pilar thinks, putting on hold her own relief if she really isn't being used against Asmodeus.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, because&nbsp;<em>now we are confused,</em> as they no doubt intended, and our lives have become&nbsp;<em>more complicated</em>.&nbsp; I rather doubt that, whatever larger plot is in play, that larger plot is meant to conduce to Asmodeus's interests.&nbsp; If their plot is to destroy all Cheliax and then <em>you </em>are meant to prevent a new Worldwound from opening amid the ruins, that is not, on the whole, good news.&nbsp; Though yes, even in that case, we would prefer there not be another Worldwound, so if some such apparent duty falls to you, perform it unless directed otherwise.&nbsp; It is the job of such as myself to counterplot against Cayden Cailean's larger plan, not you."</p>
              <p><br>Pilar nods her head.&nbsp; She understands, or thinks she does.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This leaves us with the question of your behavior and performance during your trip to Elysium."&nbsp; The Grand High Priestess regards Pilar more sternly, now.<br><br></p>
              <p>Pilar isn't nearly as frightened as she should be, she knows, even though that's a bad thought.&nbsp; She turned down Elysium for Asmodeus, and even if it's a wrong thought to think, still, that probably counts for something.<br><br></p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, I see," says the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus, her face impassive.&nbsp; "You believe that you performed adequately?"</p>
              <p><br>Is she still supposed to answer in words at all?&nbsp; Probably, unless she's told not to, she's been asked a direct question.&nbsp; "No mortal performs to Asmodeus's standards," Pilar answers.&nbsp; "And all imperfections are worthy of punishment, if the slave is even worth that much time."&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilar can't quite stop herself from thinking that, imperfect and flawed slave of Asmodeus as she may be, she's probably due for quite a lot less punishment than others would be in her position.&nbsp; This thought is itself, of course, worthy of punishment.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The face of the Grand High Priestess remains impassive.&nbsp; "Do you know how specifically, you fell short?"</p>
              <p><br>Pilar knows some parts that are obvious even to her.&nbsp; "I was unable to justify myself clearly, when the Elysians asked me why I didn't want to stay - if I had been more trained in theology, I would have been able to -"</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Chaotic Good outsiders cannot be persuaded into our Lord's embrace, and to justify yourself to them or argue with them, even taking our Lord's position, does not serve His interests in any way.&nbsp; That you answered the Elysians at all is your failure, not that you answered incorrectly."</p>
              <p><br>Pilar feels stupid.&nbsp; "I understand."</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What else?"</p>
              <p><br>"The Elysians told me that if I stayed in Elysium, I would never again have to cast torture spells on children with no other uses in order to prove my loyalty, which they somehow knew I hadn't liked doing in the academy.&nbsp; I could feel myself swaying to that, and when I felt that, I knew that after I came back, I would have to be retrained to do it better and without any hesitation.&nbsp; For only a moment, then, I was tempted to stay."</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Pity," says the Grand High Priestess.&nbsp; "That significantly decreases your future usefulness.&nbsp; I will make a note in your file that you are not to be tasked with such work unless there is strong reason."</p>
              <p><br>Pilar doesn't know how to respond to that in words, at first, for being so surprised.&nbsp; She would expect to be punished for her reluctance and corrected; for her to be exempted from unpleasant work instead is something that could be mistaken for mercy, and it is impossible that Aspexia Rugatonn would reason so.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There will be plenty of time to train out every last one of your flaws after you are received in Hell," the Grand High Priestess answers the unspoken thought.&nbsp; "Meanwhile, in this world, your proven loyalty is potentially useful.&nbsp; If that is a weak and vulnerable point in you, I will not have it strained without good cause and bring into question whether your loyalty remains as it was.&nbsp; The more so, if the Elysians could potentially have planned to lure us into doing exactly that, after first giving us apparent reason to trust you."</p>
              <p><br>Again Pilar feels stupid, but this is only natural when somebody who is not Aspexia Rugatonn is talking to somebody who is Aspexia Rugatonn.&nbsp; The Elysians made her scared of something that, it turned out, was not in Asmodeus's interests to do to her.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What else?" says the Grand High Priestess.</p>
              <p><br>Pilar swallows.&nbsp; This part is worthy of severe punishment.&nbsp; "I had the thought several times that - when they showed me Hell, and what that's like for people who aren't me - that, even if I didn't want to be in Elysium - maybe it would be better - if the people who wanted to be in Hell could be in Hell and the people who wanted to be in Elysium could be in Elysium."</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are correct, that is a thought worthy of severe punishment."</p>
              <p><br>Pilar bows her head.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You may find it useful to contemplate, however, that the present nature of things is temporary.&nbsp; In due time, everyone will go to Hell, and everyone will want to go to Hell."</p>
              <p><br>That does make Pilar feel better, though she's surprised that she's getting any consolation at all when the thought is incorrect in the first place.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Because if you are so flawed as to have that thought, there is no point in allowing that thought even greater power over you by failing to consider what weighs against it on its own terms," answers the Grand High Priestess.&nbsp; "Now, Pineda, answer me this.&nbsp; Why am I the one consoling on you on this, instead of you taking these issues to someone in the priesthood or simply Security, whose time is far less valuable than mine?"</p>
              <p><br>That's a good question and Pilar is unable to stop herself from thinking that maybe it's because, having proven her loyalty, she's now that valuable - no, that wouldn't make sense, it's Chaotic Good outsider exposure which only the Grand High Priestess is most competent to correct if it introduced any problems -</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Wrong.&nbsp; According to Security's initial interview with you, you thought of asking them for correction, but you had the thought that, if the Elysians were telling you the truth, maybe the Security officer was also somebody who'd take the chance to stay in Elysium if they believed they had that chance.&nbsp; You were afraid that, if that was true, being corrected by Security would mean replacing your more correct thoughts with their less correct thoughts."<br><br></p>
              <p>Pilar did also think (not that this defends her or lessens anything) that she didn't distrust them in general, it wasn't that she distrusted Security about Security, it was just, on the particular issue of being tempted to stay in Elysium, thinking incorrect thoughts when you're in Elysium, she couldn't trust them <em>about that</em> -</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "So the leader of Asmodeus's Church in Golarion had to personally take her valuable time to correct you, because, now, you would not have trusted almost anyone else.&nbsp; Now that Chaotic Good outsiders have whispered to you that you are more truly loyal to Asmodeus and more correct in your thinking and more trustworthy than the senior wizards in security."</p>
              <p><br>"Yes," Pilar whispers, feeling miserable.&nbsp; The Elysians got to her after all.<br><br></p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Unfortunately, the Elysians told you the truth.&nbsp; This being the case, your concern was simply correct.&nbsp; Nearly all wizards in Security and indeed even most priests of Asmodeus have <em>not</em> proven themselves able to meet the test of true loyalty that you passed.&nbsp; They are not authorized to correct your thoughts about Elysium or who is most loyal to Asmodeus.&nbsp; Only myself or those I designate are authorized to so correct you."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That said, to state your self-humbling thought more precisely, great loyalty is often not the quality most critical to a commander.&nbsp; One usually wishes for great competence foremost, accompanied by whatever level of loyalty seems adequate and with some safety margin.&nbsp; If on some rare occasion the quality we needed in a commander was the greatest possible loyalty, and this was more important than your lack of experience and knowledge and power and your many other failings, perhaps then you would be placed in command.&nbsp; Nor should you mistake the <em>possibility</em> that your superiors are less loyal than you, for your own certain knowledge of that fact.&nbsp; Understand?"</p>
              <p><br>"Yes," Pilar answers.<br><br></p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Good.&nbsp; After this, you will report to the temple torture chamber and assign yourself whatever degree of punishment you feel is appropriate for your failures in Elysium."</p>
              <p><br>To say that Pilar is surprised would be an understatement indeed.&nbsp; She will obey, of course, but - she doesn't understand, is this a test, to see if she'll assign herself too little punishment, or if she'll assign herself extra to prove her loyalty -</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are done with tests of that kind," the Grand High Priestess answers.&nbsp; "You have passed the strongest version of that test which anyone could face.&nbsp; You know your own history in more detail than I do, my time is valuable, and I cannot be bothered to interview you on specifics and evaluate them.&nbsp; You do it.&nbsp; Just assign yourself whatever tortures seem standard and appropriate for your failures.&nbsp; If you desire any more punishment than that for reasons of faith, do it on your own recognizance."</p>
              <p><br><em>Because you are trusted, now.</em></p>
              <p>No, Pilar must only be imagining that this could be the subtext, here, she is not - not that worthy, she is only a second-circle wizard -</p>
              <p>Pilar rises and turns to go.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Pilar," Aspexia Rugatonn says, before Pilar has reached the door.&nbsp; Her voice is, if not gentle, unusually not-harsh.&nbsp; "Pride is one of our Lord's domains.&nbsp; As you should not be mistaken about who is above you, you should also not be mistaken about who is lower.&nbsp; Speak to me the thought you are not letting yourself think."</p>
              <p><br>Pilar turns back.</p>
              <p>She takes a deep breath.</p>
              <p>"Grand High Priestess," Pilar says, "if you had to lead an army of adventurers into Elysium, and anyone who followed you would have a choice to stay in Elysium, how many - how many could you find to take with you?"</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Eleven."</p>
              <p><br><em>Eleven!?&nbsp;</em>Pilar thinks in dismay and even horror, though she does not, of course, question the Grand High Priestess out loud.&nbsp; Eleven, <em>in all of Cheliax?</em></p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, I am sure there are many more than eleven in Cheliax who would make the choice you did to leave Elysium behind.&nbsp; Our service to our Lord would be pathetic indeed, if all the Church's work in Cheliax these last eighty years had produced no more than eleven souls truly loyal to Him.&nbsp; The trouble is, you see, Pilar, that Asmodeans do lie to themselves, about what choice they would make there, and though this lie is also pleasing to our Lord, it is still, in the end, a lie.&nbsp; They would not know their disloyalty even to themselves, and Detect Thoughts would not suffice to root them out.&nbsp; The Chaotic Good outsider who spoke to you was also truthful about that aspect of things."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We punish people whose disloyalty rises to the level of thoughts that we can see, that they can know to themselves; and while that does to some extent serve to train away disloyal thinking, sometimes it only trains away the visibility.&nbsp; In Cheliax, where they know their thoughts will be read again in time, that serves well enough; when there is a certainty of Hell in time, it serves well enough.&nbsp; Faced with Elysium, those thoughts might suddenly resurface."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There are many more in Cheliax who would refuse Elysium, of that I am sure.&nbsp; There are eleven of whom I <em>know.</em>&nbsp; Eleven of whom&nbsp;I am <em>certain.</em>"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Well.&nbsp; Twelve, now."</p>
              <p><br>Pilar Pineda feels prouder in that moment than she has in her entire life.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There is no reward for a job well done in Cheliax," says Aspexia Rugatonn.&nbsp; "Only a diminishing of punishments for failure.&nbsp; This does not mean that a job done well never benefits you, Pilar.&nbsp; Only that, if so, the benefit is incidental to how it serves our Lord's interests.&nbsp; You have proven yourself as few of our Lord's followers ever prove themselves, and if you were not already assigned to one of the most important projects in Cheliax, you soon would be."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go with Asmodeus, Pilar Pineda.&nbsp; You have done as well as mortals ever do."</p>
              <p><br>"Thank you!&nbsp; You've been so super helpful to me, actually, do you want a cookie?"</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>Pilar turns and hurls the sourceless cookie at the wall as hard as she can.&nbsp; Under other circumstances she would scream.&nbsp; This was literally the finest moment she will ever have in her life, and Cayden fucking Cailean just ruined it for her.</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Only if you let Him ruin it," Aspexia Rugatonn says, though the harshness is back in her voice.&nbsp; "I genuinely hope we can find something to do about your problem."</p>
              <p><br>Pilar departs.&nbsp; She is reminded of the fact that Aspexia Rugatonn's time is indeed valuable, and how much of it just got spent on her, when she sees the line of important people who were waiting outside for her to finish.</p>
              <p>The next person in that line, robed as a third-circle priest, darts inside and slams two pieces of paper on Rugatonn's desk and begins some rapid hushed report without waiting for the door to shut.&nbsp; The door hasn't closed and sealed away the sounds within, in fact, when Pilar on her way out hears the Grand High Priestess's voice rising to almost a shriek, "<em>He what?</em>"</p>
              <p>Somebody is about to have a very bad day, and Pilar is glad it's not her.</p>
              <p>She skips her way along towards the temple's torture chamber, for almost ten full steps, before she realizes that she is <em>fucking skipping through the halls</em> and manages to fucking stop it.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>At first it's not obvious to the remaining student body of the Secret Project what exactly they're supposed to do with themselves; Carissa's orders, when she briefly walked past them while retrieving her possessions to leave with Keltham for the imperial palace, were 'learn about Taldor'. But it doesn't take them all that long to find their feet; obviously no one's going to come walk them through everything like they're children.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Security has swept the villa for things left behind by Kuthites, found a couple of old chambers that were perfectly sealed up with old skeletons inside, which isn't very interesting, and reorganized all the bedrooms so as to make the place defensible if the project returns here, though it might not. There are devils openly patrolling the grounds, now, each of them bound within their ten-foot circles (it's the cheapest way to get devils). They can't fight much like that, obviously, but they'll notice it. And unlike human security they don't complain about the by-now-fairly-torrential rain.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And the whole mess is a good excuse to completely reformulate the library to be in line with the project. Paxti requests permission to go with Security to Absalom book-shopping, and when that doesn't work Yaisa tries seducing Elias for the same privilege (he sleeps with her but does not take her to Absalom, which is a valuable life lesson). But there's sorting through all the existing books for consistency with the new paradigm, and making fun of the old Taldane romance novels, and while Security's using all their Teleports for war-related travel they do go out to Ostenso's bookshops and find some books published in Taldor or in pre-Hell Cheliax they can work with.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>By the afternoon of the day after the attack this effort is in full swing; they have books in piles on the floor, and are reading through them and chattering about them and sorting them and Mending them as needed. They have a plan for if Keltham shows up unexpectedly, they're going to claim there was water damage to the books, since a bunch of windows broke in the fight and it's been raining so hard since then. (So that this isn't a lie, they're causing some water damage to the books.)</p>

              <p>"But actually it's more that - we don't just need the mice, we need a place to keep mice for a few weeks while we watch them to see if they're pregnant, and I don't know what that lab equipment looks like in Golarion.&nbsp; I can go to Acquisitions myself if I know who that <em>is,</em> I guess, but then it feels like I might accidentally get, like, just two hundred mice in a giant bag.&nbsp; I sometimes get the impression that people here, who are not you, may not really <em>expect</em> my plans to make sense; or, rather, they're not surprised if it only makes sense to me and not to them.&nbsp; Which is how you end up with a giant bag of mice and no mouse food.&nbsp; So, my theory is that first I explain to you what I need and what it's for, and you ask me questions until you're confident you've understood, and then you actually say it to Acquisitions."</p>

If Maillol (he has to be in trouble, that's the only reason they'd know how long he'll be indisposed) didn't know in advance who'd be able to do this then there isn't a wizard that powerful who's up to date on the whole thing.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>If the word 'rape' is translating at all correctly, Keltham is having some trouble seeing how the notion of a 'rape fetish' isn't as obviously paradoxical as 'asking somebody to rape you'; but presumably there's some elided meta/object distinction that makes sense of it, and in any case that's not the most urgent topic right now.</p>
              <p>So.&nbsp; Pilar has the fetish.&nbsp; But it's very common locally, maybe it's 1/3 of the population, say, if he'd also checked Ione then taking the universe at face value there'd be a 55% probability of at least one of the two having the fetish.&nbsp; But still, it should probably be called something like one bit of evidence favoring the eroLARP hypothesis.</p>
              <p>"I wasn't saying Sevar was too stupid for it," Keltham replies after taking a moment to think.&nbsp; "I was saying the concept structure came at the end of a long series of other concepts, that would take too long to explain.&nbsp; Higher Intelligence doesn't let you bypass that sequence, what would be needed is that you have a lot of prerequisites that I'd guess to be outright unknown in Golarion."</p>
              <p>There's also the concern about whether explaining the notion of an eroLARP to people inside the eroLARP will drive them insane or cause this universe to collapse.&nbsp; But if Carissa is able to hear him talking about his weird theories and the very smart people immediately investigate them in Pilar and report back to him, it doesn't seem like that kind of eroLARP; they're apparently allowed to know.&nbsp; Anyways, though it seems kind of foolish in retrospect, he already published that private key.</p>

              <p>"I'm not really sure how to say it, except that the patterns are in my memories out of dath ilan, and their origin in dath ilan was complicated," Keltham replies.&nbsp; "I would not have particularly <em>expected</em> to find facts and events here, corresponding to those memories.&nbsp; And a lot of things don't correspond in that way, to be clear, I'd have been much less confused, getting here, if this world was even 5% made out of things I was expecting to see.&nbsp; But there's bits and pieces of this world, all over, that fit into one pattern or another.&nbsp; And the danger is that I'm just looking up at random clouds, and seeing faces, trees, patterns in the sky that are pure coincidence.&nbsp; As you say, if the fetish is very common here, then Pilar having it isn't much evidence."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>All right, that's slightly impressive, maybe the bigger headbands are actually good for anything.</p>
              <p>"It would have to be, yeah, but I don't exactly have a lot of specifics and what specifics I have... aren't something I'm thinking of a good metaphor for... let me think."&nbsp; Sure, if you've got <em>enough</em> prerequisites, it's obvious in retrospect that the explanation for what happened to Keltham is that <em>almost </em>all of the copies of him ended, across the multiverse of everything being infinitely embedded all over the multiverse, and this is one of the Kelthams that didn't end, in some universe that's either higher-complexity than his original universe or of course a higher-complexity specific embedded somewhere simpler than that, and then, arguendo, if the EroLARP Hypothesis is correct, he was localized to somewhere such that it has convenient evolutionarily-implausible 'masochists' who are <em>super </em>okay with not being let out of their chains when they struggle, so that hurting them during sex, which it turned out you really wanted to do, doesn't get you kicked out of that city or exiled to the Last Resort.</p>
              <p>Keltham <em>has not figured out why this would be the case,&nbsp;</em>but he doesn't need a specific hypothesis of&nbsp;<em>why</em> to notice what it&nbsp;<em>looks like</em> and start generating predictions.</p>
              <p>And then, of course, you have the problem of explaining this to a Golarion native who has no idea that her own world sure looks like it runs on quantum mechanics the same as dath ilan, and how that means there's an exponentially vast number of near-exact copies of her spread all over the <em>local</em> amplitudes to say nothing of the alternate laws of physics that embed each other as substructures.</p>
              <p>Does Taldane contain the word 'fanfiction'?&nbsp; No it does not.&nbsp; Well, there goes that metaphor for 'this world is a continuation fic of my life because in an infinite multiverse containing an infinite number of fanfiction writers no book can ever truly end', which, on reflection, would probably have been an overly disturbing thing to try to explain <em>anyways.</em></p>

              <p>"So Carissa Sevar is, in fact, under your de facto power, exactly where she wants to be and needs to be.&nbsp; The possible problems I foresee, stem from you failing to understand that this is what she needs, this is what she wants, this is how her sexuality works, and that your de facto power to do anything you want with Sevar is <em>part</em> though of course not&nbsp;<em>all</em> of why she started being attracted to you in the first place.&nbsp; It is in the interest of Cheliax for obvious reasons that you continue to be happy with Carissa, fond of her home country of Cheliax, energized and productive for your project, and not <em>distracted </em>by being <em>heartbroken </em>after what happened when you were always careful to emphasize to Carissa how much she was free to go at any time if she didn't want to stay."</p>

              <p>"There are, I suppose, other possible interpretations of why a submissive would give herself entirely to a man, whom she somehow happens to be very attracted to, who coincidentally happens to have de facto absolute-power over her.&nbsp; But given that Sevar has in any case told you to do anything you want with her, I don't see why you would be worried that I am, say, trying to lure you into doing <em>too much to her, more than she wants,</em> which is itself a rather odd thing for me to try to accomplish."</p>
              <p>"The part where her new dominant, that's what you are, does not <em>understand</em> that he has de facto absolute-power over her, where he does not&nbsp;<em>understand</em> that this fact is itself something that she needs in the foundation of her sexuality, seems like something of a Fireball trap waiting to go off in somebody's face.&nbsp; I am trying to defuse it."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"I think, first and foremost, that you should not press yourself too hard or make yourself unhappy by going too far too early, even if that's what Sevar wants," Isidre says, making a sudden change of plans.&nbsp; "This is an Evil country, not a Good one, and among the foundational reasons for that is that Good people all trying to help each other instead of themselves seem to inevitably end up sad and unhappy at the end of it.&nbsp; You have a Civilization to build here, Keltham, your role in life is not actually to make Sevar happy.&nbsp; She is responsible for her own life's happiness, as you are for yours."</p>
              <p>"<em>With that said,</em> if you yourself,&nbsp;<em>for your own sake and not hers,</em> decided one day to demand that the government of Cheliax give you absolute-power over her and order our Security to put her forcibly into her chains any time she didn't want to go, Carissa Sevar herself would be very, very happy about that.&nbsp; But I will quite understand if you do not wish to essay that until you are confident of your ability to discern that happiness for yourself."</p>
              <p>"And.&nbsp; There are other women in Cheliax if Sevar's happiest outcome is <em>not what you want.</em>&nbsp; You are not obliged to give literally the first girl in this world that you talked to everything that she wants from life, at your own expense.&nbsp; That is what it means to be Evil rather than Good."</p>
              <p>"A further warning.&nbsp; Sevar is not the most extreme case of what she is.&nbsp; Pilar Pineda is more submissive than Sevar, substantially more masochistic than Sevar, and would, in a way very strange to you, feel raped if you made her have a careful conversation about sex instead of just forcibly throwing her onto a bed.&nbsp; My considered opinion is that if you are struggling and flailing with Sevar you are <em>absolutely certainly</em> not ready for Pineda."</p>

              <p>...actually, why&nbsp;<em>did</em> he use Detect Poison, this time, when he didn't think to try it in the dining hall before?</p>
              <p>Are his instincts trying to tell him something?&nbsp; Keltham now wishes he hadn't eaten that snack; but he's at least not going to eat any more.<br><br></p>
              <p>His brain, still running in the background and creative as ever, suggests that, if this is an eroLARP-ish context and therefore Keltham has a dreadful buried urge to rape somebody which Pilar matches, he could in fact run three Augury spells before trying that, to check what the consequences would be.&nbsp; Obviously after having first done a bunch more work to verify that the Augury uses his own utility function or a sufficiently aligned neighboring one.</p>
              <p>Keltham tells that thread to shut up.&nbsp; He's starting to doubt this whole eroLARP business if it implies that he would enjoy <em>that</em>.&nbsp; Anyways the concept of a 'rape fetish' in the sense of 'wanting unwanted sex' is literally paradoxical and the term presumably means something else.</p>

              <p>"In practice, the actual and much simpler reply is that the revelation from Asmodeus which led to this project's establishment said, or at least, we think this is what Asmodeus was trying to say, to not pull any of that on you.&nbsp; So no such discussion was ever entertained at any level of government.&nbsp; If you're looking for a simple answer that doesn't require you to worry about backroom discussions by people like me, it's right there, I suppose.&nbsp; Possibly that's why Asmodeus ordained it so, if you feel that way.&nbsp; I don't think we <em>would </em>have decided to unsheathe blades at you, absent His order, but I can see His order simplifying things from your perspective."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>That couldn't&nbsp;<em>actually</em> be the reason for Asmodeus's instructions, could it?&nbsp; No, it has to be some pre-existing godagreement, or a bargain with Abadar and Nethys whose initial premise was that they cooperated to bring Keltham here and Cheliax got first crack at him, or one of the other likely possibilities that Aspexia reluctantly discussed (reluctantly because Aspexia would rather that Abrogail shut up and follow His orders).&nbsp; Absent those instructions, Cheliax most certainly could have gotten compliance out of Keltham, regardless of his society's silly pretense of a godlike immunity to threats -</p>
              <p>And now Keltham is thinking about how the other possibility would've played out, whether he could commit suicide using a Create Water cantrip or other tools that his god could unilaterally give him.&nbsp; But Cheliax could just raise you, then, poor fool; Miracle doesn't require consent.&nbsp; The only danger would be if Abadar could instruct Osirion to raise Keltham before Cheliax could, and Cheliax would know it was in a race and they would have that information first -</p>
              <p><em>Now</em> Keltham is also thinking about Raise Dead, and thinking about the story Carissa gave him about oaths, and how he could if necessary break an oath over something trivial, unilaterally in a way that nobody else depended on so it wouldn't actually violate the ~~~~~~~~~~, and so go to Abaddon.</p>
              <p>Keltham expects to - just end up somewhere else, if he did that?&nbsp; But he knows he might not and this doesn't faze him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>He'd literally rather go to Abaddon than comply.</em>&nbsp; True death doesn't scare him as much as it scares some dath ilani, he's thinking now, and - he's not even imagining Cheliax severely torturing him in a scary way to which he'd prefer nonexistence, the thought that they could break him with torture still hasn't <em>occurred </em>to him, he'd just <em>walk out on this entire universe and existence itself rather than accept a forced unfair division of gains from trade,</em> because if you can't do that, why would anybody bother bargaining fairly with you.</p>
              <p>He wouldn't actually have been able to do it, if Cheliax was running Detect Thoughts on him, and not otherwise restrained by Asmodeus.&nbsp; They've ever had experience with uncooperative torture victims.&nbsp; You don't instantly end up in Abaddon and instantly get eaten.</p>
              <p>...but maybe, just maybe, Abrogail feels the tiniest shred of respect for Keltham at this point.&nbsp; That degree of 'fuck you' is something she can appreciate.</p>
              <p>Of course now she wants even more to see what Keltham's mind would look like when it broke, but Asmodeus said not to do that so she won't.</p>

Lastwall wouldn't hand her over, probably - why? 'simplifies cooperation with people like Keltham' jumps to mind as an explanation with Fox's Cunning up, in a way it wouldn't jump to mind otherwise. But obviously the Good gods do sacrifice people to horrible fates to achieve their goals ....what's the difference? Is it just that Good gets incredibly worked up about rape in particular?</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Why did Asmodeus tell them to cooperate with Keltham? It's one of three important glaring confusions right now, along with "what is Maillol in trouble for" because Carissa suspects she's probably in trouble for the same thing, even if they're going to punish them one at a time about it, and "what does Cayden Cailean want" which she's trying not to think about but which feels salient since they're talking about, you know, Good and whether they sacrifice people to be raped if it achieves their long goals...</p>

              <p>"In almost any place and&nbsp;<em>organization</em> in Golarion, you will find a large number of people running around believing things that are not true, that bear at best a tenuous connection to reality, or no connection at all, stories that got repeatedly passed around and distorted.&nbsp; I would guess that dath ilan prevents this, somehow, I can't actually imagine how, which means it might never occur to you that something people were whispering excitedly to each other might <em>not</em> be true."</p>

The palace found one inside four hours. <em>One</em>, not <em>two;</em> there isn't an invisible person with Detect Thoughts somewhere telepathically bonded to Isidre and passing along Carissa's thoughts with impressively little delay. There isn't a random countess Carissa's never heard of who's read all the project transcripts.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There's just Her Imperial Majestrix, certainly the highest Splendour they could find on such short notice. Presumably not literally just here to fuck with Carissa, that'd be taking pride a little far, but certainly going to fuck with Carissa while she's here. As she is entitled to. Because she can do whatever she wants.</p>
              <p>(Carissa isn't exactly surprised by, but does admire, the perfectly straight face 'Isidre' has been keeping for the last twenty seconds.)</p>

              <p>Why yes, dear, while all our eighth-circle wizards are currently on the front lines with Nidal, there <em>is</em> an eighth-circle sorcerer remaining with incredibly high Splendour who would enjoy having a chat about Carissa Sevar's sexuality and, oh, yes, that other topic you requested be introduced.</p>

              <p>The second thought is to ask whether this rumor is perhaps true.</p>
              <p>It admittedly&nbsp;<em>does in fact</em> sound a lot more like the sort of thing that would be passed around six-year-old kids, than would make very much sense in real life, but&nbsp;<em>even in Golarion,</em> presumably, the people who pass around rumors like that are probably running their own sanity checks&nbsp;<em>at all,</em> and think it's not completely obviously false?</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa was braced for the Queen to say a bunch of flattering nonsense that has nothing to do with the real reason which is that Asmodeus chose her. Or, well, maybe Asmodeus choosing her was related to her understanding the Law better than almost anyone, but, realistically, it was probably a combination of that plus being attractive to Keltham plus being a heretic in a coincidentally useful direction -</p>
              <p>- anyway. Obviously the Queen of Cheliax doesn't like Carissa for the traits that Carissa values most in herself. It would be pathetic to believe that. It would be pathetic to believe even if it's being spoken into your ears with very high Splendour by someone who would know. Carissa is not pathe- okay, Carissa<em> is</em> pathetic, Carissa has spent like five percent of her mental motions this conversation on being happy that Keltham is protective of her, you can't do that and then claim you're not pathetic, but Carissa's not <em>that&nbsp;</em>pathetic. The Queen wants Carissa because she can't have her, and Carissa's personality has very little to do with it, because one doesn't show that much personality while being horribly tortured anyway and the thing the Queen wants to do with Carissa is horribly torture her. This is the not pathetic thing to believe and Carissa believes it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>But it's true that she had the highest spellcraft at her Worldwound installation. And it's kind of nice that Cheliax did have that written down somewhere. (Unless they didn't, and learned it from her irritably thinking it earlier today, which now that she thinks about it seems likelier.)</p>
              <p>And it's true that she understands something no one else did, which made Asmodeus choose her.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>....and it's true that he'd have done that even if there were only a tiny chance she did anything useful, and that if she fails he won't care if the Queen turns her into a statue and she never ever ever exists again. Stop being pathetic you will be&nbsp;<em>gone&nbsp;</em>you won't&nbsp;<em>exist&nbsp;</em>the stakes are&nbsp;<em>much&nbsp;</em>too high to be that&nbsp;<em>contemptible&nbsp;</em></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa exists because she might serve Asmodeus and might serve Cheliax, and she intends to try to do that, and she does not have any feelings at all.</p>

              <p>"Keltham, you're missing a lot of context here on how submission works, but - among the approaches that had occurred to me, if things developed in that direction of greater complication - was seeing if the Queen could rent Sevar from you for a half-day for five hundred gold pieces and get it out of her system.&nbsp; Please don't object that you don't own Sevar, the point is that this is a recognized practice when somebody like Sevar gives herself to you, and the fact that the Queen would be <em>renting </em>Sevar from you means that she isn't <em>stealing</em> Sevar from you or <em>fighting</em> with you over Sevar and the whole thing is occurring in a way that acknowledges Sevar is yours and not the Queen's and the Queen only gets to have her because you said so -"</p>

I....hope very much that it isn't, but if the Queen of Cheliax ends up inevitably in conflict with you then we'll prepare you for the betrayal of a Kuthite spy; I don't need to understand the patterns to acknowledge that if they're making good predictions they might keep doing that.'</p>

              <p>"In dath ilan, we have systems of revocable delegation that people can use to aggregate into much larger political factions in a way that remains legible at every level of organization.&nbsp; Among its other uses, this permits Civilization to annually form a Masculine Faction and Feminine Faction to negotiate with each other about what common masculine and feminine behaviors should be, not one standard for everyone, but pieces you can make your own behavior out of and have them be quickly describable to others and mesh well with other standard behaviors.&nbsp; Like, grandmothers are one subkind of women and grandfathers are one subkind of men, that sort of thing.&nbsp; This requires real Lawfulness and therefore shouldn't be able to exist in Golarion, and therefore all of your notions of what grandmothers and grandfathers should be like, must come from somewhere else -"</p>
              <p>"I'm probably digressing here, my point is, you're describing something weird enough that I'm trying to fall back to basics and make sure of my foundations.&nbsp; You are describing a system in which somebody, usually a man, does something with a second person, usually a woman, that falls into a standard pattern that they both understand, and which some third party therefore also understands."</p>
              <p>"That system of meshing behavior patterns is that the party of the second part -" Taldane please, you can't use that many syllables for <em>that,</em> your contracts would be infinity pages long.</p>
              <p>"That meshing-pattern system is that Two tells One that One can do whatever One wants with Two.&nbsp; After which One rents out some of Two's time to Three, but it's not that Two is anything like a rentable resource that One rents into a market for Twos, it's that One and Two and Three all think that's hot.&nbsp; And maybe also Two likes to trade oral sex for footrubs and Three likes to give footrubs and One does not like to give footrubs, and usually you'd just solve this problem by Two and Three forming a secondary or tertiary relationship," like normal sane people do when monogamy isn't working for someone, "but if Two gave themselves fully to One, then One is supposed to decide who Two fucks, so One being able to demand money for that from Three, is a symbol of how One still has all the Two and hasn't given any of it back to Two to use, or Three paying One is symbolic of how much Three isn't taking away some of what Two gave One, Three is paying One for it.&nbsp; Is that about right?"</p>

              <p>It could almost be a dath ilani poem from some layer of some virtue, though he does not know which virtue it would correspond to.&nbsp; There is a spirit in it that is not in any poem he can remember having heard before, something that comes to it from the way that it is a relation between a mortal and something larger than that, being trusted.</p>
              <p>He closes his eyes and imagines it, he doesn't bother with imagining a better world drawn in grains of sand, the better world his god draws is drawn in grains of people, agents all over the world interacting with each other.&nbsp; Their actions scattered and uncoordinated, for now, stepping on each other and hurting each other, for now, but there are other actions they could take instead that would make all of them better off, fairly.</p>
              <p>He imagines himself as one of those grains, one of those people, and if this was going to be a realistic metaphor he should be a special one, maybe, except that right now he's not.&nbsp; Just one of all the people in Golarion hoping for this war to end quickly, and contributing the tiny little action that is cheering their god on; if they all do that, they'll all be better off.&nbsp; Keltham visualizes a grain like any other, to represent himself.</p>

              <p><em>Tenacious enough that no wind can rip you away once you're there.</em></p>
              <p>It's not his comparative advantage, no, but if almost everyone in Golarion is doing their part, right now, he can spend fifteen minutes doing his own.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa closes her eyes and prays for Asmodeus to win.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It's a sincere prayer, obviously. She does not like Zon-Kuthon and she believes in the project Zon-Kuthon was willing to blow up everything in order to oppose.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She's definitely some flavor of heretic at this point. She isn't sure what flavor. She assumes they're mostly monitoring for whether she's about to betray the project, and she's not, she believes in the project with as much conviction as she can recall ever having felt for anything that isn't the continued survival of Carissa Sevar. Which is also served by the project succeeding. But there was a set of stories meant to point people like her in the right direction, and she knew they were lies, and now she had to face what specifically they were lies about, and learn a new set, which are also lies, but lies better suited to the position she finds herself in now, and -</p>
              <p>- she knows she can't handle the truth. She knows that even in dath ilan there's the concept not everyone can handle every truth, she knows it's possible to learn the Law even when many truths are hidden from you. But she's slightly worried that until she invents evil dath ilan thinking herself everything'll ring a bit wrong, not quite crafted for a mortal mind in the particular fragile place Carissa finds herself in.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Except, maybe, advice for little children about prayer. Slightly adjusted advice, no one ever told Carissa Asmodeus was trying to craft a better world. That's still true. It's true to Keltham, too, it landed, meant something, and she can worry later about what that means for the plan where they seduce him into Evil, it seems just as important to their plans that they find the bits of their own teaching that feel true even to dath ilan.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She imagines herself a grain of sand in the grand designs of Asmodeus, and strives to be placed where she'd needed, and fierce in remaining there, no matter what interference of other gods or other grains of sand, and hopes that Asmodeus can see, from where he stands, something beautiful and right and strong and Lawful that can be built of mortal building blocks.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Zon-Kuthon is losing too quickly.</p>
              <p>Zon-Kuthon is a god; and depending on how you count it, either a very old entity, or something built out of the corpse of something that old.&nbsp; He models reality, therefore, entirely in probability distributions.&nbsp; He has no mortal heritage of any other way of seeing.</p>
              <p>When this war began Zon-Kuthon formed a probability distribution over how long the fight should take, and gambled on a chance to drag it out long enough to ruin the crops and visit misery on a generation.&nbsp; But He is losing too fast, in the unreasonably far tails of that probability distribution, especially given the further information He now has about the war's participants.</p>
              <p>The external-demigod-assembling fragments that Zon-Kuthon deliberately set to reunite with Himself quickly and early in predictable locations, to act as tests of the theory that all His longer-buried fragments are being hunted and destroyed somehow, returned to Him.&nbsp; And yet Zon-Kuthon... does not have an ominous intuition, He was never that mortal.&nbsp; He has rather the hypothesis that Nethys is opposing Him, that this is the reason for His losing too quickly, and the implication that, if so, His longer-buried external-demigod-assembling fragments will be gone.</p>
              <p>He randomizes, then, with far too much power, in a way that Nethys can of course see but should not be able to <em>foresee </em>with prophecy shattered; and based on the result makes an expensive calculation of where something will be while its trajectory is still complicated; He focuses much of Himself someplace it is not at all convenient for Him to be, losing ground in the war as He does; and there He finds that His external-demigod-assembling fragment that should have been flitting through that location is gone.</p>
              <p>He knows, then, He understands the betrayal and that Nethys it was who worked it all upon Him from the beginning.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>And what does Zon-Kuthon do, when He is betrayed?</p>
              <p>Mostly, of course, Zon-Kuthon does what serves Zon-Kuthon's longest purposes of pain, misery, terror, mutilation, woe.</p>
              <p>But if there were a tiebreaker between two strategies - if there is some little thing that Zon-Kuthon can do along the way -&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Then Dou-Bral, if He had been so betrayed, would have done some last thing He could to work vengeance on His betrayer.</p>
              <p>And all that Dou-Bral was, Zon-Kuthon is not.</p>
              <p>Nethys is betraying Him?&nbsp; Of course He is.&nbsp; How amusing.&nbsp; No doubt Zon-Kuthon will be the first of many.&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon then will tell nothing to the other gods of how Nethys has begun the series of downfalls that will inevitably lead to Their own destruction, destruction more complete than Zon-Kuthon's mere sealing.&nbsp; Whoever currently thinks they are Nethys's ally will find themselves mistaken; Zon-Kuthon can guess, of course, that Nethys is probably trying to side with fellow gods who also once were mortal, but Nethys being Nethys, the road that has been started down is one from which Nethys is unlikely to be able to turn back.</p>
              <p>It is not a certainty, obviously, this beautiful vision.&nbsp; But the probability is one to gamble on; and a better gamble than the one where Zon-Kuthon announces Nethys's sins, in which case there is not much chance&nbsp;at all&nbsp;of lasting damage to the world and misery to the gods.</p>
              <p>He will go into the vault, then, for a time, and say nothing of Nethys's betrayal.&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon has been exiled once before, after all, and it did not last.&nbsp; Evil stays contained less long than one might hope.&nbsp; If Nethys brings enough ruin to the gods, the vault will last even less.<br><br></p>
              <p>Zon-Kuthon's pieces begin to gather into the vault. &nbsp;They will not slay Him; they need Him to counterbalance Asmodeus yet.</p>

              <p><em>Zon-Kuthon, a known existential threat, attacked the exact location where my mortal followers had secured and contained the anomaly.</em></p>
              <p><em>My anomaly-storing followers validly deduced that this meant that Zon-Kuthon knew about the anomaly, knew where the anomaly was being stored, and was targeting the anomaly.</em></p>
              <p><em>They knew that if Zon-Kuthon had attacked the anomaly at this location before, Zon-Kuthon might attack the same location again, more forcefully, and perhaps breach containment.</em></p>
              <p><em>They therefore moved the anomaly to an even more protected location which Zon-Kuthon might not know to target, though they are protecting it without trying to make that assumption.</em></p>
              <p><em>Since You had only recently declared the containment zone and I was busy containing known existential threat Zon-Kuthon, my followers did not know, while making this decision, that they were leaving Your containment zone in their choice of new location.</em></p>
              <p><em>I realize that this is not the outcome You desired, Otolmens.&nbsp; But I, Asmodeus, have not acted with intent to contravene the spirit, let alone the letter, of your Pharasma's-Name Edict, and the subsequent events will clearly be legible to Pharasma or any other sufficiently informed gods as being how I described them.</em></p>
              <p>Asmodeus goes legible so that Otolmens can see that He is being completely sincere.&nbsp; Look how legible Asmodeus is.</p>

              <p>There is now nothing preventing Asmodeus from giving instructions to Asmodeus-obeying mortals, such as, for example, instructions to move the anomaly back to the containment zone.&nbsp; Where Zon-Kuthon will not be able to attack it again, since Zon-Kuthon is now sealed.</p>

              <p>Now, however, in addition to having already used up many resources on the previous interdiction field, Asmodeus's followers are at war with Zon-Kuthon's followers to help prevent further existential threat from any previous plans Zon-Kuthon has laid.&nbsp; This will be grindingly expensive to Asmodeus's followers.</p>
              <p>They cannot afford to lay a new interdiction field while the war is still continuing, so they stored the anomaly inside a previously built interdiction field with existing heavy security.</p>

              <p>Who is known to already know about, and have acted around, the anomaly?&nbsp; Abadar, Nethys, Otolmens, Irori, Cayden Cailean.</p>
              <p>Otolmens need not be considered.</p>
              <p>In the case that Asmodeus's interests are being targeted by the plot, Abadar would not have originally reached out to Asmodeus with a poisoned trade; Abadar retaliates, in such matters, but does not attack.&nbsp; Also the whole thing is not really Abadar's style.</p>
              <p>The remaining gods involved, Cayden Cailean, Nethys, and Irori, are all former mortals.&nbsp; Formerly mortal gods do tend to be more interventionist in mortal matters, and so more likely to appear there, but still.&nbsp; The thought has not escaped Asmodeus that perhaps there is some common interest of the gods who were once human, opposed to the interests of the gods who never were.</p>
              <p>Who else was clearly involved?</p>
              <p>Gorum, Chaotic Neutral god of battle, who suddenly switched sides about whether Zon-Kuthon should be allowed to roam free.&nbsp; Gorum being Gorum, He might not demand to know all about it, it is not in the nature of War that all soldiers must understand why they fight; but whoever contacted Him and successfully brought Him on board was probably somebody whose purpose Gorum finds sympathetic.</p>
              <p>Iomedae is formerly human, and her work often conduces to Gorum's ends.&nbsp; And Iomedae now holds the key to a certain vault.&nbsp; But Iomedae will only use that key under certain rigidly defined conditions; holding it does not clearly benefit Her by much.</p>
              <p>And if you consider this entire plot, it does look, a bit, more in the style of Chaos than of Law, or at most Neutral on that axis.&nbsp; To be a god is not to have the nature of carrying out strategies that some third party might see as nothing but otherwise-featureless choices of paths to final consequences; if that were so, there would be little overt difference between Lawful and Chaotic ones.&nbsp; Gods drink more deeply than that, of their own natures, and Lawful gods make Lawful plans and Chaotic gods make Chaotic ones.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus will see, then, what Milani, formerly-mortal Chaotic Good goddess of revolution, will do, given a prompt to meddle in this particular issue, and perhaps that will prove revealing.)</p>

              <p>Well, Asmodeus is being, in fact, pretty straightforward for once, more straightforward than He'd be with anyone who wasn't Otolmens.</p>
              <p>Otolmens asked for Asmodeus to tell His followers to do something very expensive in the middle of their war with Nidal.&nbsp; It would cost them somewhere in the vicinity of 100,000 gold pieces, more than 50,000gp, less than 200,000gp.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus does not think that this matter is going to destroy the world and is not going to do this out of the charity of His heart.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus wants to be paid.&nbsp; He's not going to mess with Otolmens, because Otolmens, but He wants to be paid.</p>
              <p>That's it.&nbsp; Look at how legible Asmodeus is being about how He didn't set Otolmens up for this, didn't secretly prompt Her into making the request, and isn't trying to sneakily make His mortals do anything more expensive.</p>
              <p>If Milani could suggest a straightforward trade and service for Otolmens to do, that Asmodeus will accept, without being particularly Chaotic or Good about it which Asmodeus will NOT accept, then Milani would be doing Her proper part to help out Otolmens, just as Asmodeus is not trying to pull anything complicated on Her.</p>
              <p>As for specifics beyond that, Asmodeus will not discuss Otolmens's affairs without Her consent, lest even more gods meddle in them.</p>

              <p><em>The service I have in mind will benefit Cheliax, currently Yours for now.&nbsp; </em><em>Cheliax by and large tends to do things that I find very unpleasant.&nbsp; But as the symmetry and opposition between your interests and mine is not perfect, there is a chance here for mutual benefit.&nbsp; Nidal, for example, manages to be such an awful place that Cheliax is actually better than it, and for Cheliax to conquer Nidal entirely would serve both of Us well - though the gain from Your perspective would be larger than the gain from Mine, and I would demand payment to make up that difference.</em></p>
              <p><em>I propose in particular that you legibly exhibit to Me your honest expectation of how long the war with Nidal will otherwise last and how much it will otherwise cost; our compact will call for You to pay Me for how much better for Cheliax the war ends up going, compared to that expectation, after I suggest my proposed service to Otolmens.&nbsp; You will pay me for improvements as they become nearly certain, however, rather than waiting for the war to end.&nbsp; I would commit not to using those payments to work against Your interests; not everything that I want is something you hate.</em></p>
              <p><em>One similarly observes that although You derive similar pleasure from torturing most of the souls in your possession, there are in truth some souls' tortures that I find more tragic than others, even though they are all tragic.&nbsp; If Cheliax ends up with a counterfactually larger population compared to what You expected, after Otolmens's intervention suggested by me - due to their increased counterfactual wealth and hence population growth, or their conquest of other territories - the compact would call for You to instruct Cheliax to use fewer of certain tactics and techniques that you designed specifically to lead good people into damnation.&nbsp; If the payment cannot be made up that way, it can be made up in relaxations of other Chelish policies designed at producing damnations of people who are not, in fact, particularly evil.&nbsp; I would also accept payment in the form of stays of torment for souls of my choice in Hell.</em></p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodeus has many thoughts about this; even this fraction of His mind is large and has room for many thoughts inside it.&nbsp; Among those thoughts is that this compact would happen to benefit Milani a great deal more if, for some reason, Asmodeus had otherwise underestimated how well the war with Nidal would go for Cheliax; and Milani, somehow, knew about this, when Asmodeus did not.</p>
              <p>It is still relatively good news about whether Milani - and some conspiracy that She is part of - is mainly plotting something directly and irrevocably opposed to Asmodeus's interests; unless, of course, that is exactly what Milani wants Asmodeus to think.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus responds with a counter-proposal.&nbsp; It has much more stringent definitions of exactly what kind of counterfactual improvements will be said to be traceable to Milani's particular suggestion for Otolmens's intervention.&nbsp; He is not willing to include all the knock-on effects, just in case Milani has something up Her sleeve in one of them.</p>
              <p>(The overcomplicated terms are designed to exclude, in passing, improvements in war conditions and of Cheliax's health that go through Otolmens's service but <em>also</em> passed through whatever has His squirrels in the anomaly's immediate vicinity so excited.&nbsp; Asmodeus <em>has</em> noticed them becoming more excited, over the last couple of days.</p>
              <p>If Milani rejects that part - or suggests overcomplicated modifications in return that would again count knock-on benefits passing through whatever-excited-His-squirrels - Asmodeus will have a much clearer idea of what is going on.)</p>
              <p>The part about stays of torment for souls in Hell is, of course, entirely unacceptable.&nbsp; The crushing inevitability and hopelessness is really part of the whole point there.&nbsp; Though Asmodeus supposes that Milani could suggest some very, very high rate of conversion between new souls added and old souls stayed, with temporary stays of torment doomed to end.</p>
              <p>(If Milani suggests an astronomical but reachable rate, it will suggest that, for some reason, Her target is a particular soul in Hell, and the rest of this is just an elaborate ruse to disguise it.&nbsp; Asmodeus doesn't know&nbsp;<em>why</em> Milani would do that, it seems more Stupid Good than Chaotic Good, but it's among the many many possibilities that Asmodeus is considering for what might really be going on.)</p>
              <p>Also Asmodeus is not going to integrate the expected benefits over infinite time to be paid out immediately because Asmodeus is not three minutes old.</p>

              <p>It involves exactly the sort of overcomplicated amendments to Asmodeus's amendments that you might expect from somebody who had no idea what the original amendments had really been about, but didn't want to admit that.&nbsp; The new set of overcomplications do still happen to exclude any knock-on effects of Otolmens's service that pass through Keltham's project.</p>
              <p>Milani suggests a conversion rate of 36 counterfactual souls expected to be added over the next 100 years, per 1 soul's torment stayed now for up to 100 years; but the stays will pass through Erecura, the Lawful Neutral goddess who now resides within Dis as Dispater's consort, and Asmodeus Himself will not know who is targeted by them, nor may He attempt to find out, nor may those stayed be told by Hell how they came to be so blessed.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Policy in Dis is to take reasonably good care of souls awaiting resurrection; it doesn't do to have them return to life desperate to escape Hell for real at any cost. Accordingly the contract devil who owns Asmodia has her copying spell diagrams which can't be typeset, for books of magic. The working conditions are pleasant, for Hell. There is a light that Asmodia can fuel with her blood, and which bathes the workspace with a pleasant golden glow bright enough to copy by without straining one's eyes. The chair is not uncomfortable; that makes scribes slower. There are, of course, no breaks, because petitioners do not need to eat or sleep; if Asmodia is too slow to finish a page she is simply encouraged to drink a potion that'll aid her concentration.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The potions are painful, of course. But Asmodia is, if wholly uninteresting herself, adjacent to something interesting, and so her contract devil told her in a friendly sort of voice the secret to making the potions much less painful. It's that they separate, left on the shelf, into an oily top layer and a magically active bottom layer. It's the top layer that causes the agonizing pain, and if it's dumped out on the ground the potion won't work, but it's all right if it's fed to a different person than the one drinking the rest. (Hell's alchemists worked very diligently to achieve this effect.) Since, at the moment, the contract devil is feeling generous with Asmodia, she may go out and feed the potion-tops to some of the less useful apprentices, or if she's ahead of schedule on her scribing she may go all the way out to the waterfront and feed the first sip of the potion to the conscious, petrified angels that are spaced regularly for decor. You know, as a treat. There are many treats in Hell for the obedient.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>But Asmodia doesn't have time, so right now she's feeding the potion-top to a less useful apprentice, one very close to her own desk, but not the closest one in case that was some sort of trap for lazy girls.&nbsp; She has no idea who this boy was in life, he looks young but could easily have been here for a hundred years for all she knows, his tongue is burned away and reburned by the line of potions he regularly drinks.&nbsp; What happens to him if he doesn't drink the potions, Asmodia doesn't know.&nbsp; He's chained to his desk and can't stop her, doesn't try to stop her, each time she pours one of the potion-tops into his mouth.&nbsp; Maybe he thinks Asmodia is authorized to do whatever she wants to him, maybe he doesn't realize he could fight back, maybe he isn't in fact allowed to fight back at anything done to him, Asmodia doesn't know.</p>
              <p>Asmodia wouldn't waste any time on pitying him even if there was any pity left in her nature.&nbsp; There's very little doubt that copying spell diagrams for distribution in Cheliax is one of the best jobs in Hell, optimized mostly around maximum production for Cheliax and hence unable to distract the petitioners too much from relatively delicate work.&nbsp; Asmodia's going to be retrained into a contract devil when she dies and that will be much much worse.&nbsp; If she could get this boy's position for herself, when she dies, by throwing him into a lake of fire to burn there forever, there's no doubt she'd do that too.&nbsp; Maybe that's how the boy got his position, by being extra good and doing horrible things to somebody like her.</p>
              <p>She hates him.&nbsp; He's so much better off than she'll be.&nbsp; The passive way he accepts her torments feels like he's mocking her, like he's suppressing a smile knowing how much worse she'll get hers, in time.</p>
              <p>Asmodia asks her contract devil if she's allowed to hurt that boy more for any kind of extra credit, if she has only a little extra time in her schedule but not enough to go feed petrified angels.&nbsp; She doesn't want to waste potions by feeding him extra potion-tops.</p>
              <p>They'll still probably raise her.&nbsp; They'll still probably raise her.</p>

              <p>What happens to Asmodia now?</p>
              <p>Asmodia doesn't ask; it's plaintive, whiny, pathetic, if they want her to know they'll tell her.</p>
              <p>(Unless the rules are different in Erecura's Gardens, but no, no, that's too much to hope for, all hope does is hurt you.)</p>

              <p>Well, either, she's not a useless waste of a person, in some way that Erecura Herself can't foresee, like She said, or, Erecura didn't say, that anything was beyond Her sight, She just asked other questions back, when Asmodia suggested, suggested that, somebody, somehow, somewhere, somewhere in all of everything everywhere, cared about her personally, and did this for her.</p>
              <p>She does start crying, then.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She's still not sure if it was in fact a good idea to push Keltham on the Second Law and on being more sadistic, she's not sure she'll know for a while if it was the right call or not. She understands the Second Law stuff better now (though she's still hoping she'll get it better still once she sees the transcripts) but she suspects it's not something she can use to do anything, making the universe look more like a sex story will also make Keltham wonder if Cheliax is doing that on purpose, besides how it involves lying and lying remains very dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The whole thing might have gone better without the Queen involving herself but - Carissa's not actually sure. It's not as if there are a lot of agenda-free eighth circle casters who understand the project well enough to get through a conversation with Keltham at all. And the Queen's agenda right now seems to involve convincing Keltham that Carissa is very valuable, which does feel nice. Even though it's probably false. And even though Carissa's pretty sure that anyone else would've assigned a milder punishment for what was admittedly a very insubordinate thought but she's been&nbsp;<em>having her thought transcripts read by the Queen and by high-ranking Church officials for several days now while trying to run a sensitive operation&nbsp;</em>and she actually thinks most people would have had, like, two insubordinate thoughts. Or even three.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"I was born in Corentyn. It's a city on the same coast as Ostenso, but pretty far, five hundred miles or so, right where the Inner Sea opens up into the ocean. My father is a merchant; he works out what cargo will be sent in his ships to other cities, and what they'll trade for there, and he sells foreign goods to merchants in Corentyn and sells Chelish goods far away. I have a half-brother who's going to take over the business from him someday. That's how it's normally done; there's a lot of accumulated expertise no one's written down, so you teach your children. Teach your sons, until pretty recently. My mother is a wizard and when she met my father was doing odd wizard work, a step up from laundry - daily cooling spells for people who don't like the summer heat, Comprehend Languages to translate for merchants, that kind of thing.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>When I was young there was a civil war, and that's when the Queen signed her compact with Hell and formed modern Cheliax, though I don't remember much about it, except that the ships were impressed for moving soldiers around and my father was very annoyed about it, and parts of the city where we didn't live got destroyed. My mother kept me home and tried to teach me magic. After the war the church opened up a school for wizards in Corentyn and my mother got a job as a teacher there and I tested in, and did very well, and when I graduated was encouraged to enlist in the Chelish army and go fight at the Worldwound, because it'd be best for my growth as a wizard and paid very generously and was also necessary to prevent the destruction of the world, which even Evil people care about typically. So I enlisted, and I've served six years now, with a year off in between three-year terms. I planned to stay until I hit fourth circle, because I want to be fourth-circle, and I knew in my heart I might actually stay until I hit <em>fifth</em>, because then you can&nbsp;<em>Teleport,&nbsp;</em>and then I was going to open a magic shop in Corentyn and have kids and be rich."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>So Carissa already knows herself well enough to know she'll want children.&nbsp; Well, she's had longer to figure it out than Keltham.&nbsp; Then again, some people younger than Keltham already seem to know...</p>
              <p>...why is he thinking that he doesn't know if he wants children?&nbsp; He was going to become a billionaire and have&nbsp;<em>lots</em> of children.</p>
              <p>It's pretty obvious on reflection that it's because these children will be real.</p>
              <p>"I was born in Default, the city you're born in when you're not born anywhere particularly interesting, because your parents don't have any particular reason to be anywhere else and so they might as well live where everybody else lives; it's the largest dath ilani city in the world, and the center of Governance is there but not in the center.&nbsp; I got the usual education, but with fewer persistent friendships over time with other children, because my parents moved around a lot.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom is that more persistent friendships are better, in childhood, but my parents basically waved it off because they thought I'd be pretty much all right even if they didn't optimize every single aspect of my childhood as hard as possible.&nbsp; I agree with them about that, but one still gets the impression that all of their friends were horrified.&nbsp; In that dath ilani way where you're privately horrified but conceal the overt signs because, first of all, you don't think that exerting more social pressure will help, and second, they can guess perfectly well that you're horrified.&nbsp; We had a small house-module, maybe something like a tenth or twentieth the size of the villa that got burned down."</p>
              <p>"I'm not sure at exactly what point it became clear to them that I was a little different than the other children, but it must have definitely been apparent at the point where I got - one of the elaborate tests that children get, in dath ilan, which aren't just there to measure us, but also to provide the results for the prediction markets that say what will happen in Civilization's future - anyways, I apparently ran across a lightly injured adult who needed me to get help, and I helped him, but I wanted to be paid for helping.&nbsp; I think that was when my parents decided that they'd made a mistake by assortatively mating with each other to select on the quality of reserving a little more of their life for themselves, and moving a lot if they wanted to do that, even if it meant their child's life was less than perfectly optimal; I was more selfish than either of them, which doesn't always happen, in a heritage-mating setup like that one, but happens sometimes.&nbsp; And dath ilan - when you're different, if it's something they can live with at all, they'll do what they can to make life in Civilization easier for you, despite you being different, because everyone is different, somehow, somewhere, everyone needs exceptions.&nbsp; My parents did the very correct thing, then, and sort of gently tried to offer me opportunities to be more Good, if I wanted to be, but without suggesting that I couldn't still just be Evil if I wanted.&nbsp; They argued with me about it, and tried to argue me into being Good, but only after I started it by trying to argue them into being more Evil."</p>
              <p>"I left home as soon as I could pass the requisite financial maturity and self-governance tests, at thirteen.&nbsp; I set up in a part of Default distant enough that my parents wouldn't visit me often enough to be annoying.&nbsp; I got a very default job - doing a thing you don't have words for, setting up high-precision processes that do things, very mundane high-precision processes though, like some business wanted a tweak made to their high-precision process for selling things," this language <em>really</em> is not going to do 'computer programming' without a&nbsp;<em>long</em> digression, "and put all the money I could into the craziest investments I could find that basically seemed to me like they should work, some went up, some blew up, after five years of that I was ahead of the broader market but very barely.&nbsp; I was hoping to - teach myself, if I kept investing like that, that I'd get good at it."</p>
              <p>"For socialization I had a circle of friends my age writing, a kind of stuff that doesn't exist here, though I did a lot more reading and only enough writing to count, but it meant that when everyone was sitting around in a circle eating whatever people had brought in and talking about everyone's work, that I could keep up and talk about it.&nbsp; I picked that writing circle because their themes were, not quite 'doompunk', not quite, Evil aesthetic, more like supervillainy, but not that really - the point was that they were people who could admire people who were selfish, so long as those people were clearly fictional and they weren't out there being selfish in real life.&nbsp; Which, you know, beats people not even appreciating the aesthetic as an aesthetic.&nbsp; I thought about trying to find a circle of other more selfish people, but always decided against it, because - I didn't want to take it from being my personal identity, to a group identity, it was <em>mine </em>and I didn't actually want to be around five other people doing it slightly differently and have debates about that."</p>
              <p>"Civilization really does try hard to make it possible for people who are different to, just be like that and it's fine and their lives aren't about being different.&nbsp; But a lot of us who are different don't want&nbsp;<em>that</em>, either, we don't just want to pass through it all unnoticed, we feel like we have something to prove, not because Civilization is telling us to prove it, but because we want to prove it anyways.&nbsp; And if what you want is - to be acknowledged for it, to make people admit something, to excel so much that you're above average, Civilization isn't just going to hand that to you.&nbsp; Not everyone can have things that not everyone can have."</p>

              <p>Keltham elects not to say it out loud, for now.</p>
              <p>"They didn't think I was a mistake, a person that they'd wish they'd never made and brought into the world.&nbsp; Nothing like that.&nbsp; Not even close.&nbsp; They felt they'd made their own wrong life choices that had resulted in me existing, that's not the same as saying that I shouldn't exist, that if there's a button you press to get a Keltham, you don't press the button.&nbsp; They just felt that they could've made other choices and gotten some other result instead, and then they would have felt like they'd made their own choices correctly, not that one possible child would be - more valuable to them than the other, if you put them side by side -"</p>
              <p>"Their lives are also theirs, and their regrets belong to them, and they didn't try to make them be something about me or something of mine."</p>
              <p>A sudden lump comes into his throat, as Keltham realizes, having not quite thought of it before:</p>
              <p><em>Everyone who knows me thinks I'm dead.&nbsp; Really dead.</em></p>
              <p>The Keepers have to know.&nbsp; The Keepers ought to tell anyone who's really broken up about it, right, it shouldn't be <em>that </em>much of an infohazard - that you wouldn't even tell the kid's own parents, he's still alive -</p>
              <p><em>The Keepers will tell them that Keltham is still somewhere, probably many different somewheres but some weighing more than others, and that to say anything about the details is far beyond anything the Keepers can do.&nbsp; The Keepers would not be able to foresee specifics like Golarion.</em></p>
              <p>Dath ilan wouldn't put that much effort into cryosuspending every single person no matter what, if they expected all the selfish sadists to end up in worlds with masochists who give them everything they want.</p>
              <p>Maybe hearing the current state of knowledge is actually worse for somebody than thinking their kid is just gone, because if they're just nonexistent, nothing any worse can be happening to them, and more importantly,&nbsp;<em>you can be done thinking about it at some point.</em></p>
              <p>Maybe the Keepers won't tell his parents, or anybody else who knows him, after all.</p>

              <p>Not that this is necessarily a good thing.&nbsp; Though it could be!&nbsp; Keltham doesn't know.&nbsp; It depends on, you know, the entire state of the entire multiverse that he cannot in fact extrapolate in his tiny little mortal-sized brain.</p>
              <p>But he should maybe not talk about this much until he's tried to figure out the ways in which it will be an enormous infohazard, which, again, it clearly will be, somehow.</p>
              <p>"I suspect that - at the scale where whole universes interact, like that - time might not mean as much, or be as synchronized, as it is in Golarion.&nbsp; If you can see dath ilan from here, if that's at all controllable, then it might be just as easy to see dath ilan's past as what I think of as its present.&nbsp; That could be why Asmodeus wasn't trying to grab anyone else right away, if it was expensive, and if He knew that all that was needed was one dath ilani to get things rolling here, and that, in time, Golarion's Civilization would then ascend to where it could finish the job itself."</p>
              <p>"And if you think about it from the perspective of somebody who died - they just need - someone, somewhere, who's powerful enough, who can see them, and cares.&nbsp; Or is willing to trade with something else that cares."</p>
              <p><em>Some trades stretch across time.</em>&nbsp; It's a saying in dath ilan that usually means something rather different, there: just ordinary time in one world, coordinated trades that parents make with children who don't exist yet or haven't matured as economic agents.</p>

              <p>"Well, I don't exactly know how I feel about that. On the one hand it is sort of interesting to have smart people try to think about your life for you, I'm always wishing I was smarter and could do that better. On another, I feel strange about it being someone I haven't met who is reading the project transcripts presumably in their capacity as a Chelish administrator. On another, there's something romantic about people having meetings with you about optimizing me, makes it - less like pretending. On another, you've been here for three days and they've been very stressful and you haven't actually signed up for responsibility for optimizing me! What if you don't want to optimize me? - possibly this is too many opinions to have about a one-sentence summary of a conversation I didn't witness. Sorry."</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- so when I went to the sex shop, there was this sort of pervasive assumption that it was - a little like a costume shop, I don't know how to explain it - that some people like to dress up as the possessions of other people during sex, in the same way as some people like to dress up as dragons during sex, and so they'd sell you the outfit for it. And there's nothing wrong with that. But at the Worldwound people were doing something different, something better suited to me, where - you could give terms up front, obviously, but whatever terms you gave, those were real. They weren't a costume, they weren't a game, the whole thing was obviously in an overarching sense governed by the<em> treaty</em> so no one was risking being maimed or murdered but you wouldn't say 'oh, hmm, I'm bored now'.</p>
              <p>And I was slightly worried that the nobility, being the nobility and sort of aliens at best anyway, had the concept but only the costume-party concept." Yep, that's the problem with the Chelish nobility, that they might be assuming by default that their relationship is one of equals-with-some-pretense, <em>definitely </em>not that everyone who doesn't know exactly what's going on assumes what's going on is that Cheliax gave the alien some welcoming gifts. "And if they're asking you, then - then they're not working off a costume-party concept. Even though it's a sort of silly thing for them to have done and I'm sorry you were inconvenienced."</p>

But my ideal endgame here is that we build a dath ilani city in conquered Nidal and get all the modern conveniences Civilization invents before anyone else and I have so much spellsilver I can do every project that comes to mind as soon as it does and I make us immortal -- though we can still visit Hell sometimes, maybe have a vacation place in Dis -- and sometimes you have a very spirited try at hurting me until I say 'no', and you can't do it."</p>

              <p>"I haven't had anticonformity training, yeah," and appreciate the warning this is something you might do to us because wow it sounds kind of nightmarish in the same way as having the Queen show up to mock you for your thoughts from the transcripts she's reading. Except in the opposite direction so getting both at once is double nightmarish.</p>
              <p>There's genuinely something terrifying there, something that feels like realizing you're not standing over solid ground but on a tightrope over the Abyss.</p>
              <p>Or like noticing you could peel all your skin off. It's true but did you really need to notice it.</p>
              <p>Of course most thoughts are the thoughts you're supposed to have.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><br>How about a change of subject.</p>
              <p>"Well, when it comes to having girls by force, I think there are actually more women with that fetish than men who want to fulfill it, so maybe you can have fun without handwringing about the market value of the experience you're getting for free. Or maybe you can charge, though the specific nature of the fetish does make it seem hard to do that."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"I am worried that your Alliance is not quite Dark enough, frankly, based on interacting with Isidre and hearing some of her concerns about how much fun the Queen isn't having.&nbsp; Very smart people in dath ilan tend to lean Good.&nbsp; The obvious potential problem with that, if not otherwise averted, is that when you care about a very large number of people, you can end up with very large numbers inside your mental decision processes and especially the parts that do abstract thinking.&nbsp; That can produce thoughts at," edges and vertices of the space of thoughts, "extremes you wouldn't get with a more naturally selfish person where the weights don't go much larger than the weights they put on themselves."</p>
              <p>"Now this, to be clear, is a problem you have to solve with more Law, rather than less Law.&nbsp; If it's a predictable fact that certain ways of thinking are going to make certain mistakes, predict it and then don't make the mistakes.&nbsp; If a Good person ends up thinking it's a good idea to break an oath and go to Abaddon in order to save some larger number of other people from going to Abaddon, they could imaginably be right by their own measures, in which case there's no arguing with the," utility function, "values that entities assign to final outcomes.&nbsp; But I would far more expect to observe that Good people end up systematically mistaken about how much good oathbreaking really does, for example because of the further consequences of people not being able to trust Good people's oaths any more, or anyone's oaths because that person might be secretly Good, or just because Good people usually and systematically end up not saving as many people as they hoped with the sacrifices they make."</p>
              <p>"If you have a lot of very smart Good people, they can train each other out of mistakes like that.&nbsp; I doubt Golarion even bothers to collect <em>statistics</em> on the kind of mistakes that very smart people make."</p>
              <p>"And the other thing about Civilization is that we do not often have to worry about fifteen percent of the population dying.&nbsp; There are not millions of people in fixable-seeming horrible situations, and if there were, you would be working on it with a lot of other people rather than nearly alone.&nbsp; Which probably helps a bunch in practice to keep our smart Good people from ending up at weird extremes without them having to be incredibly Lawful about that."</p>
              <p>"To a dath ilani, Isidre reads strongly as someone with overly large problems to worry about, insufficient Law by dath ilani standards, and an intelligence headband too much more powerful than the headbands of the people around her."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham tries to figure out how he'd feel about telling the Chelish government - well, not to give him Carissa or else, because, like, that is stupid on so many different levels both as decision theory and as a trap that Isidre could be setting for him if she was less than absolutely trustworthy.&nbsp; Please give him Carissa permanently or until he gives her back, to do with as he pleases, and have that be the regulation of Cheliax and not just an arrangement between the two of them, formalizing what Carissa gave him informally, as Carissa herself wants according to your very smart people; and in return Keltham charges Cheliax very very slightly less of their GDP increase, or some such.</p>
              <p>It's not - particularly landing, at this point?</p>
              <p>In a world with Pilars, Keltham can see, somehow - not with the eyes of dath ilan but with the eyes of his own sexuality, that had no place available for it in dath ilan in a way that wasn't anyone's fault - Keltham can see how there could be a submissive!woman gender-subtrope that is like being pursued and dated, but more so. &nbsp;He can imagine how that gender-subtrope of woman might think it was more romantic for a man to desire her so much that he came in and just took her away, paying costs to do that but never asking. &nbsp;The question of how this ends up with the right people matched, and without giant flaming obvious incentive problems if a man likes a woman who doesn't like him back, may perhaps rest on Golarion institutions unknown to him; or it may be a reason why this desire unsatisfiable in reality is fed mainly by Golarion romance novels.</p>
              <p>He can imagine that Carissa wants that - even if he's pretty sure he's not imagining it correctly, true to the real Carissa Sevar, it's enough to explain why <em>a</em> possible person would want that.&nbsp; To be in - metaphorical bed-chains, in her larger social and legal situation, chains that she wears always, as proof that a man wanted her that much.</p>
              <p>Carissa wants it, let's suppose that to be true; does that situation appeal to Keltham himself?</p>
              <p>...not really.&nbsp; The part where Carissa gives herself to him feels deeper and more meaningful, to him, than that choice being taken away from Carissa so that Keltham no longer knows she's still making it. &nbsp;It's a choice that says Keltham is worthy, that he and his sexuality are worth so much to Carissa, that she has judged him and chosen him even though she could have had another, that he is valuable to Carissa in a way he was not so valuable to any woman in dath ilan.</p>
              <p>Is there some way you still get that in full measure, if somebody is with you because they can't escape within Golarion and have opted not to escape to the afterlife?</p>
              <p>Keltham isn't seeing it, for now.&nbsp; Maybe his thoughts are being too crystalline and logical about it; too denying of subtleties and forcing it all into 'well, but then therefore' where people could just opt to not conclude that therefore.&nbsp; Maybe there is a way that Keltham can know Carissa still finds him worthy, even as she lives truly in the world where she has no other choice.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Like the Detect Desires spell, for example.&nbsp; If you have <em>that</em> around for people who can afford it, then it is <em>obviously</em> going to change some things -</p>
              <p>SHIT.</p>
              <p>Does Isidre do <em>that</em> to the people around her.&nbsp; Cast Detect Desires around them, or have it cast by a cleric who reports to her, and maybe not a cleric of Asmodeus either.</p>
              <p>Keltham is trying not to believe it <em>too </em>hard, but his brain just shouted very loudly "YES SHE DOES", because Isidre knows <em>far </em>too much about what various people want.&nbsp; And it is <em>extremely</em> the sort of deontology violation that you'd expect from a Good person with a deficit of Law, an overly powerful intelligence headband, and horrifying problems that are horrifically large.&nbsp; Isidre would reason that the privacy violation was just not really that important, on the scale of twenty million people; and even if her intelligence headband lets her fake some intuitive shadow of the Law of Coordination, she might still argue to herself that knowing more true facts about somebody is not something that ought to cause a breakdown of coordination.&nbsp; Keltham isn't even sure she's wrong, he doesn't have her problems.&nbsp; Call it 75% probability.</p>
              <p>But suppose Carissa is fine with Detect Desires being used on her.&nbsp; Though, maybe that aspect has to be illegible so Carissa doesn't have to admit to herself that she could escape by wanting to be free... well, leave aside the deontology violation of doing it without asking, suppose the thought experiment anyways.&nbsp; Or maybe Carissa says Keltham is entitled to Detect Desires her and truthspell her whenever he wants, because that is part of what it means to give herself to him, and they never have to make mutually legible why or whether Keltham is doing that.</p>
              <p>Consider that Least Convenient Possible World, for the argument against putting Carissa in a situation where the 'absolute-power' (Keltham thinks the Taldane word in Baseline) that Keltham has over her has been formally materialized and made real.&nbsp; The world where Keltham casts Detect Desires every morning, or multiple times per day because Least Convenient Possible World, and the spell always says that Carissa still wants him and judges him worthy and would have him hold 'absolute-power' over her.</p>
              <p>Then what?</p>
              <p>Then Keltham does not really see the added appeal from&nbsp;<em>his</em> perspective; but it is not obviously, or not <em>legibly</em> obviously, something he couldn't do for Carissa to make her happier, at little cost to himself.</p>
              <p>Except for where his mind just screamed that he is tilting further on that dangerous narrow ledge he is standing upon.&nbsp; And also, Isidre warned him not to have that done to Carissa unless <em>he wanted it for himself.</em></p>
              <p>Keltham doing it <em>because Carissa wants it</em> is probably not what Carissa wants either.&nbsp; The Golarion woman's romance novel is about the man who&nbsp;<em>wants you that much in that way</em> and not because he thinks it is something you need to be happy.</p>
              <p>Maybe someday Keltham will come to feel for himself the thing that is the male complement of the gender-subtrope that Carissa has, where he wants for himself to make that 'absolute-power' real, and cast Detect Desires as a guardrail around it, and make it so that if Carissa can't stop wanting him then she can't stop having him either.&nbsp; Maybe someday he'll understand better the grounds he stands on in Golarion, and it will no longer seem like something that would get you kicked out of most cities in dath ilan... well, no, not actually, they're just not going to do that to you in dath ilan, if Carissa is standing there saying 'get the fuck out of our private business, Civilization, I don't need you to protect me'.&nbsp; <em>No victim no crime,</em> as the proverb goes.&nbsp; So it isn't like that.&nbsp; But maybe someday it will stop <em>feeling</em> like that.</p>
              <p>Also Civilization would... what would they even <em>think</em> of a situation where Carissa is going 'Let me out, Civilization, I don't want to be here anymore!', to test the bounds of the chains placed on her and be reassured that they are real, and Detect Desires is showing that Carissa wants <em>desperately </em>for Civilization to laugh maniacally and say 'No you belong to Keltham now!'</p>
              <p>Keltham is sad he will never get to subsidize this question in a voting prediction market.&nbsp; He really wants to know what Civilization would think of it.&nbsp; Well, no, actually he wants to see the enormous flamewar and Very Serious People shouting at each other that would happen if this question really came up.&nbsp; But also he wants to know what Civilization would think of it.</p>
              <p>What does the&nbsp;<em>Kelthamverse</em> think of it?</p>
              <p>...The Kelthamverse is, what, three days old, at this point?&nbsp; The Kelthamverse knows that it is a tiny baby world and wants to refer the question back to Civilization so that it has a good starting point.</p>
              <p>But, mostly, this thoughtsearch has reached quiescence; there is not much expected value of logical information in searching further.&nbsp; Keltham finds no desire within himself, for his own sake, to transform Carissa's free gift to him into a metaphorical chain that she wears always; and for him to do it for her sake is almost surely not what Carissa wants.&nbsp; He will reopen the question when and if he finds within himself that gender-subtrope that is complement to Carissa's.</p>
              <p>And meanwhile, he is not going to say anything to Carissa that sounds like 'Never forget, you've got the right to leave at any time!' because that would be stupid.</p>

              <p>- safer not to lie. Except for how everything is a lie. Carissa has never found lying to be difficult before and these days it's like navigating a dungeon blindfolded.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The fact that Cheliax could mind control Keltham and hasn't is useful evidence of good faith, and also she's already told him that - but also making it clear that Keltham wouldn't notice if sufficiently powerful people did it makes it impossible to preserve an escape avenue where Keltham concludes there's a rot that doesn't extend to the top -&nbsp;</p>

              <p>" - I'm going to start by saying things I'm very sure of and then get to things I'm less sure of," she says. "So, invasive divinations by default&nbsp;<em>feel like something,&nbsp;</em>it's possible to notice them happening to you. Probably, uh, Contessa Lrilatha, or the Queen herself, could cast an invasive divination you couldn't even detect - they could also do mind control that felt like your own choices - but anyone much less powerful than that would be running a reasonably high chance that their targets would notice. Unless there are some powerful secret magic items involved, which there might be.</p>
              <p>When you cast Detect Desires on me I felt it, and I could've attempted to fight you off and probably succeeded. We should .... make sure you know what that feeling is and that you haven't felt it at any time in the last couple of days. Strongly predict you haven't, though. When the priest on duty at the Worldwound first got a revelation from Asmodeus about you, his instructions to me suggested that Asmodeus had very firmly prohibited - a very wide class of things including some we don't even think of as bad behavior - with respect to you."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>In Keltham's mind, a hypothesis is taking shape, a mental model.<br><br></p>
              <p>To a Chelish eavesdropper, it would look like rather a lot of ~~~~.&nbsp; Seeing the idea as a dath ilani sees it, compactly and at a glance, requires a grasp of underlying math.&nbsp; If Keltham wanted to say it to Carissa, he would need to spell out rather a lot of things and also use a whiteboard.</p>
              <p>Keltham's thought revolves around a standard dath ilani concept that Taldane has no word for.&nbsp; 'Intelligence' translated into this word in Baseline; but Keltham is starting to suspect that this reflects a mistake that Carissa and other language donors are making, not a translation accurate <em>in the world.</em>&nbsp; For translation purposes, one must then fix a new term.</p>
              <p>Call this one 'thinkoomph'.<br><br></p>
              <p>'Thinkoomph' is optimization-as-done-by-humans.&nbsp; Its figure-of-merit is correct prediction, choice of action leading to desired outcomes, the power of inner thoughts over the outer world, the power of cognition to apprehend and effectuate reality. &nbsp;Of course, humans do this in a weird idiosyncratic way, and a random possible simple optimizer that was about as powerful as an average dath ilani would not understand and manipulate reality in the same way as an average dath ilani. &nbsp;But if everyone involved is a human, then to speak of 'thinkoomph' as a thing-humans-do whose figure-of-merit is optimization, is not too unsensible a concept.</p>
              <p>Keltham does not need to think about this part right now, he has already chunked the notion of 'thinkoomph' long ago.&nbsp; 'Thinkoomph' is a view into the processes that humans do to produce optimization, viewed from the standpoint where its purpose is optimization, and where the information-theoretic goal of the viewpoint you're taking is to make it easy to describe those usual variations among humans that contribute to the variations in their optimization power.</p>
              <p>Thinkoomph then is not a single number but a structure with some internals.&nbsp; But it happens to be empirically the case that a lot of usefully-discussable smartness-components map not-too-terribly onto a unidimensional line, such that, holding the rest of a mind constant, you get more optimization power as you move up along the line.</p>
              <p>For ease of visualization, then, consider thinkoomph as a seven-dimensional thing, because it happens that there's a useful component analysis like that in dath ilan which gives you seven dimensions.</p>
              <p>Or consider thinkoomph as a machine with seven gears each of varying size, if you don't want to visualize seven-dimensional objects for some weird reason.</p>
              <p>Suppose Detect Intelligence gives you an imperfect partial view of thinkoomph that's made up of, say, (1) speed/clarity of information retrieval plus (2) how much information you can maintain in short-term memory. &nbsp;Detect Wisdom gives you an imperfect partial view of (3) the piece of thinkoomph that's perceptual clarity, which critically has a subpiece (3a) that is clarity and detail and accuracy of introspection.&nbsp; Which is to say - shifting viewpoints from the machinery to the result that machinery produces - that Detect Wisdom imperfectly measures the machinery that grinds to produce reflection.<br><br></p>
              <p>In dath ilan the proverb-poem goes: &nbsp;'Beware lest what you can measure easily becomes all that you measure; beware lest it become all that you optimize; beware lest it become all that you ever think of.'</p>
              <p>The people of Golarion know how to Detect Intelligence and Detect Wisdom, and that's it. &nbsp;So they think there are two components of thinkoomph. &nbsp;They invent two spells to boost the thing-that-Detect-Intelligence-detects and the thing-that-Detect-Wisdom-detects.</p>
              <p>They invent headbands to boost the thing-that-Detect-Intelligence-detects.&nbsp; The amount the headband sells for depends on how large of a shift it produces in that handy spell Detect Intelligence, which, as everyone in Golarion knows, detects Intelligence.&nbsp; If the Detect Intelligence spell says that a headband produces a +3 to Intelligence, it's worth less money than if Detect Intelligence says that the headband produces +4 to intelligence.</p>
              <p>Imagine now that nobody has invented Detect Wisdom yet, just Detect Intelligence.&nbsp; Imagine that somebody with a vision of broader thinkoomph builds a new headband that would, if you could also run Detect Wisdom, show to produce a +3 to Intelligence and a +3 to Wisdom.&nbsp; This headband is probably more expensive to build than the one that produces +4 to Intelligence, probably by a lot, and the Detect Intelligence spell says that it produces an inferior result than the +4 headband.&nbsp; So nobody builds a headband like that, if they don't have Detect Wisdom.</p>
              <p>Does either Intelligence or Wisdom incorporate creativity, outside-the-box solutions, outside-the-box hypotheses?&nbsp; Maybe when Keltham dares to try on an intelligence headband, if he ever so dares, it'll be immediately apparent to him that this headband boosts every part of cognition that Owl's Wisdom didn't boost.&nbsp; But Keltham is guessing that this will prove to not be the case.<br><br></p>
              <p>Consider, then, the world in which Golarion has a Detect Intelligence spell and a Detect Wisdom spell, but these are only 3 out of 7 components of cognition.</p>
              <p>It's not the kids with highest thinkoomph who get tracked to be wizards.&nbsp; It's the kids with the highest Detected Intelligence.</p>
              <p>It is of course famously true that in humans (and describing humans is what the concept of 'thinkoomph' is all about), most things you can measure about thinkoomph's components or outputs will all correlate with each other quite a lot.&nbsp; The kids with Intelligence 14, which Keltham thinks was supposed to be the wizard-tracking threshold, do tend to have Wisdom 12 rather than Wisdom 10.&nbsp; But if you were looking&nbsp;<em>not-at-random</em> at somebody with Intelligence 14, <em>selected on high Intelligence, </em>and asking 'what are the rest of their thinkoomph components like', then the rest are probably more like what their Wisdom score happened to be.</p>
              <p>When you select on kids with high Detected Intelligence, you're not just selecting for kids with high general thinkoomph levels that produce high Intelligence along the way, you're selecting for kids whose Intelligence is unusually high compared to the rest of their thinkoomph.&nbsp; That's why the Wisdom comes out as 12 instead of 14.<br><br></p>
              <p>Dath ilan has heritage-optimized itself over generations&nbsp;<em>in full awareness of how all these measurement and optimization gotchas work.</em>&nbsp; They are doing their best to measure real-world results broadly, and doing genetics and statistics to them.&nbsp; Dath ilan does not want to end up testing some weird projection of thinkoomph that originally started out correlated with thinkoomph, optimizing over this weird projection, and ending up with optimized things that have much more of the weird projected quality than they have thinkoomph.&nbsp; Dath ilan wants&nbsp;<em>actual thinkoomph</em> and is explicitly not pursuing it the stupid way.</p>
              <p>So you've got your kid with Intelligence 18 and Wisdom 14 and they get wizard-tracked and get a +6 intelligence headband or maybe, if they become spectacularly successful, a relic with +6 Intelligence and +4 Wisdom, and if they're incredibly insanely successful, they get 2 or 3 layered Wish spells on top of that.&nbsp; They end up, say, with 27 Intelligence and 21 Wisdom; in dath ilani terms, those subcomponents of thinkoomph would now be at +4.5sd and +1.5sd respectively.</p>
              <p>But their other 4 out of 7 thinkoomph characteristics are still around 14; or in dath ilani terms, if the scales match, -2sd.&nbsp; Golarionites don't know how to easily measure these other components; they don't try to boost them; they don't think about them.</p>
              <p>This sounds a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more like a model consistent with Golarion, than the model where <em>anyone </em>with +6 thinkoomph has literally ever existed here.&nbsp; You don't need training to be a Keeper at +6 thinkoomph, you just are one.<br><br></p>
              <p>Inside Keltham's mind this is all a much shorter and better-chunked thing to think; what he thinks, roughly, is 'Hey maybe they got Goodhart's Cursed on Intelligence and Wisdom metrics'.</p>
              <p>Only Keltham's actual thought is that thinkoomph is the underlying true value; Intelligence and Wisdom are imperfect proxy measures of thinkoomph; optimization over Intelligence and Wisdom will select not just on thinkoomph but on upward divergence of measured Intelligence and Wisdom scores from underlying thinkoomph scores; that this applies both to selecting students for wizard-tracking and for boosting them with Intelligence headbands later; and that this will of course produce people who may detect as +4 Intelligence and +4 Wisdom but who started with something like -2 or -1 underlying general abstracted-correlation-of-thinkoomph-components, and now have something more like +1 final-optimization-power as a result of all that Intelligence and Wisdom boosting.<br><br></p>
              <p>Nobody with +6 thinkoomph has ever walked through this place.&nbsp; They'd shred it around themselves like tissue paper.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>After a bit of silence, relaxing again, mentally leaning into the massage, and yes, very briefly poking some internal curiosity about what exactly it&nbsp;<em>is</em> that is Pilar's obligate fetish precisely speaking, Keltham returns to contemplating more sexual questions.<br><br></p>
              <p>How does he feel about renting Carissa out?</p>
              <p>...mostly he's still getting a WHAT from his brain.<br><br></p>
              <p>Can he evaluate it concretely rather than abstractly?</p>
              <p>Not without having actually met the Queen of Cheliax at all.<br><br></p>
              <p>Okay, but, Keltham does know some people.&nbsp; He even knows some female people, in case this is a polarized gendertrope with respect to the renting individual.&nbsp; How does Keltham feel about renting Carissa to his max-mutual-wordcount coauthor from his fic-circle back in dath ilan, who happens to possess the requisite parts?</p>
              <p>...sad about never writing anything with her again, also, she's&nbsp;<em>proooobably&nbsp;</em>not a sadist like at all(??), also, maybe it actually is not a terribly good idea to think right now about people who believe he's Truly Dead.<br><br></p>
              <p><em>Keltham knows some female people inside a totally different universe that is not that universe.</em>&nbsp; He doesn't know them very well but he can ask himself the concrete question anyways.&nbsp; What if he were to rent Carissa to, say, Tonia Barrero, in repayment of the debt he owes her for an unexpected, un-volunteered-in-advance, at-best-semi-consensual truthspelling?</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>Still file not found, here, he doesn't know Tonia well enough.<br><br></p>
              <p>Keltham knows what to do in this cognitive situation!&nbsp; <em>For purposes of testing this function,</em> keep supplying imaginary values to the Tonia structure until he can complete the function call!&nbsp; If at any point he gets a negative result he can then tweak values to see if there's any value that produces a positive result instead, and then he'll also know what properties he's looking for!</p>
              <p>Let Tonia be a sadist, but, like, a young sadist who's only slightly more experienced there than Keltham, and in no danger of providing Carissa with an unforgettable experience less forgettable than other experiences she's already had, thereby causing Carissa to leave him for Tonia who is the superior sadist...</p>
              <p>...actually Keltham is not sure he really needs this part of the spec, Carissa's current attraction to him is not because Keltham is a supersadist, and therefore it is Perfectly Pseudo-Reasonable that you can't steal Carissa from him by being a better supersadist.&nbsp; Alas, that which is Perfectly Pseudo-Reasonable is not always Perfectly Reasonable.&nbsp; Anyways, fix the current values at favorable ones to see if this function returns 'false' even under quite favorable circumstances.</p>
              <p>Tonia can hurt Carissa slightly more than Keltham, but not threateningly so; she can't give Carissa an orgasm due to Carissa's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">eroLARP character arc posing a</span> sex problem, so Tonia's not threateningly better than him there.&nbsp; And if Tonia was, Keltham could always just tell Carissa she's not allowed... okay something reacted to <em>that</em> inside him, that didn't react to hearing about the magical-item Belt of No Touch.&nbsp; Possibly because in this case there was any reason for it, and that made the scenario more real.</p>
              <p>Or say mostly, in this scenario, Carissa is being rented to Tonia in order to provide Tonia with not-necessarily-reciprocated pleasure just like if Tonia had bought a sex worker in dath ilan.&nbsp; Suppose Carissa doesn't hate it - Keltham's Carissamodel is now complaining that he is not supposed to check this and that offends her dignity of being harder to hurt than that, well, sorry, Carissamodel, that is not what Keltham is optimizing right now.&nbsp; Carissa even manages to have a moderately fun time because Tonia hurts her some and reacts in a way that makes Carissa feel pride in her own sexual skills and it... actually matters to her that Keltham told her to do it?&nbsp; Postulating this part feels hard; Keltham is not himself a Carissa and he is not sure what it is like on the inside to be a Carissa.<br><br></p>
              <p>Keltham thinks he is at least <em>not obviously not-okay</em> with this whole sort of thing?&nbsp; It feels a lot like asking, in an ordinary relationship, how you would feel about your partner going out for a night with somebody else who'd been like 'yeah screw flirting what's your monetary price'.&nbsp; He wouldn't have objected to that back in dath ilan, he wasn't that monogamous with anyone.</p>
              <p>...that these feel like similar questions, probably reflects Keltham <em>failing to get to grips with the actual gendertrope here.&nbsp; </em>Isidre seemed to think this should&nbsp;<em>not</em> feel like the same gendertrope as sex work, even if it had similar gender ratios.</p>
              <p>For one thing, Keltham was&nbsp;<em>aromantic</em> back in dath ilan because he is a&nbsp;<em>romantically obligate sadist,</em> or at least the very first masochist he ran into was the first person he ever started feeling at all like he needed something from her that was about it being <em>from her</em> and didn't funge with things he could possibly get from somewhere else.</p>
              <p>How would Keltham feel about Carissa trading herself to somebody for - one unskilled-labor-week is, like 1.2gp or so?&nbsp; Let's say 2gp, Carissa is hot.</p>
              <p>Parts of Keltham are not happy with this.&nbsp; Because Carissa is <em>his?</em>&nbsp; Because Keltham is insecure about whether that would mean Carissa still liked him more than she likes anybody else?&nbsp; Because Keltham is supposed to give permission first?&nbsp; Keltham doesn't know.</p>
              <p>But if Keltham orders Carissa to do it?&nbsp; For whatever reason?</p>
              <p>- then that's okay.&nbsp; Possibly.&nbsp; At least if all the other call values are set to Imaginary Tonia settings.</p>
              <p><br>And with likely settings on the Queen of Cheliax, rather than favorable settings on Tonia?&nbsp; If, in exchange for an ultimately insignificant symbolic amount of money, and with at least some pressure on the side to deny a trope and perhaps the entire theory of tropism, Carissa is rented to Abrosomething Thrune?&nbsp; Older than Carissa, with the same de facto ability to chain her for real if she really wanted (assuming that Keltham did not object, which he would), probably a much much more experienced sadist than Keltham, with access to far more powerful sex toys that are the equivalent of overpowered vibrators with biofeedback functions and, yes, the ability to make Carissa come.</p>
              <p>...it's not quite an obvious 'no'.&nbsp;&nbsp;It basically depends, Keltham is pretty sure, on whether Keltham is afraid that Carissa can be taken&nbsp;<em>away</em> from him by somebody being a better sadist to her, than he can be for a while yet.&nbsp; If somebody is the more skillful manipulator of masochism, of, what did Isidre call it, submission, can they steal away Carissa's feelings from him?&nbsp; The threat of giving Carissa an orgasm, the threat of also having potential absolute-power over her, seem less real than that.</p>
              <p>Keltham's hindbrain, which may, of course, be entirely factually wrong about everything, intuits that it is basically not possible to steal Carissa by giving her a good-enough orgasm.&nbsp; Hurting her, maybe, understanding the deep keys to her sexuality that Keltham is still struggling with; but not with humanly reasonable amounts of pleasure short of dangerous drugs.<br><br></p>
              <p>And as for the absolute-power threat, in part, it doesn't feel as real because Keltham has not internalized a model of whatever it is that Carissa has inside her.&nbsp; But also, it's impossible for two people to&nbsp;<em>both</em> have potential absolute-power over someone.&nbsp; If they came into conflict, after all, only one of them could get their way.&nbsp; So long as that person would be Keltham, rather than the Queen of Cheliax, everything would be fine, right?&nbsp; It just has to be clear to Carissa that if Keltham and the Queen fought over her, Keltham would be the one to end up with her; if that's true, the keys to her sexuality would be safe.</p>
              <p>...not that Keltham is thinking that he can, like, wield more political power inside Cheliax than its own Nearly Unilateral Chief Executive.&nbsp; But the Queen of Cheliax has to be sensible and consider things like political capital with the Church of Asmodeus, while Keltham can be much less sensible and walk out on Cheliax if the Queen steals his girl from him.&nbsp; It shouldn't be about power alone, Keltham doesn't think; differential <em>willingness to use power</em> should be an acceptable coin to Carissa's sexuality.&nbsp; It controls who would&nbsp;<em>actually</em> end up with her, if it came to that.</p>
              <p>Keltham's not willing, not today, to bargain a probabilistic or absolute walkout on Cheliax, in order to tell the government of Cheliax to hand Carissa over to him in-legal-reality, to say that he considers her a necessary part of his gains-from-trade.</p>
              <p>Telling Cheliax that he considers Carissa a necessary part of his gains-from-trade and he'll walk out if the Queen steals her, either by kidnapping her, <em>or </em>by renting her from Keltham but then giving her an experience that shifts her romantic focus away from Keltham to the Queen?&nbsp; She's Keltham's, the Queen can't have her except temporarily?</p>
              <p>Sure!&nbsp; <em>That,</em> he feels totally willing to do.</p>
              <p><br>Carissa would...&nbsp;<em>probably</em> find that hot?&nbsp; Keltham's Carissamodel confidently finds it <em>very</em> hot if Keltham actually wins at it, but Keltham is not entirely confident in his Carissamodel.</p>
              <p>Well, at least Keltham should definitely win?&nbsp; He can't really see any functional Chief Executive being like 'lol no I'm gonna take Carissa and watch you walk out on Cheliax', and even if the Queen wanted to, her advisors would stop her.&nbsp; She's an overly-Good person in an overly-Good government that has to be stopped by Asmodeus from resorting to outright mind control when it looks like that might be for the greater good of the country.&nbsp; Keltham isn't pure Evil, sure, but he's not <em>that</em> Good, which means he should win this particular contest.</p>
              <p>Of course, that's only if people are running on sanity.&nbsp; If the Queen is running on <em>tropes</em>, she'll try to steal Carissa no matter how bad it would be for Cheliax if she succeeded... but then if those events are running on tropes, it's impossible to win Carissa's true love-sexuality <em>without</em> winning a fight for real power over her,&nbsp;the Queen should ultimately fail to do that after making worrying progress, and then end up kicked up out of Cheliax and/or harem-recruited.</p>
              <p><br>Anyways, he's got enough of an answer that his next step is to ask Isidre to meet again and check his model of how all this works.&nbsp; Or ask Carissa?&nbsp; He kind of wants to ask Isidre first, before he tries to talk with Carissa; Isidre is more willing to be legible, and nothing blows up if he says the wrong thing in front of her.</p>

              <p>- there's not actually much point contemplating what having sex with the Queen of Cheliax would be like, and not just because that definitely counts as flirting with her. It will probably be awful. Carissa is a grown adult and is going to go to Hell someday and can handle awful. It'll probably be - so, being hurt isn't upsetting, being hurt can be fun and even when it's more than she can take, like the cursed bag, it's not upsetting, it's bad but it's a specific kind of bad that's all right. There are things that are actually upsetting, and -&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The idea of ordering her to do it - seems more comfortable now, possibly it has something to do with having heard that she has any coherently imaginable endgame, maybe it's just a shock having had time to sink in and for Keltham to adjust.</p>
              <p>But then his libido might go offline for a while.&nbsp; He shouldn't expend his newly refilled ero reservoir if he needs to have another conversation with Isidre today... it's not clear how urgent this whole thing is, exactly?</p>
              <p>"Carissa," Keltham says out loud, his voice coming out sounding as relaxed as he is, "I'm too relaxed right now to really want to move, so can I ask you to have them return my reply to Isidre that I'm interested in further discussing her second suggested course of action, though I'm not yet on a definite yes.&nbsp; And can I possibly get a yes-no in the next ten minutes about whether or not Isidre wants to meet me again today."</p>
              <p>(It wouldn't occur to Keltham that Isidre might not imagine him to be capable of a quick reconsideration and answer.&nbsp; One hour is a long time to think in dath ilan, and sure it may take&nbsp;<em>longer</em>&nbsp;to reconsider some major life questions, but there's no presumption that you&nbsp;<em>can't</em> do it in an hour.&nbsp; It similarly wouldn't occur to Keltham that he ought not ask a Senior Governance Official for a yes-no answer in ten minutes; somebody like Isidre is surely interrupted often enough, and good enough at task-switching, that she's checking her tiny-task queue every eight minutes, in Isidre's computer-based and network-connected task management system; which will continue to go on existing in Keltham's imagination and his preprogrammed social reflexes unless and until he thinks explicitly about that question for literally half of a second.)</p>

              <p>Keltham doesn't... <em>especially</em> feel like massaging Carissa back, apparently, if he is honest with himself about that.&nbsp; He would do it if they were trading pleasures, obviously, but he does not seem to really actually <em>want</em> to give massages.</p>
              <p>He still feels grateful for it, and a need to do something nice for Carissa in return, no matter how much she says he doesn't have to; he wants to anyways.</p>
              <p>Keltham doesn't feel like massaging her back.&nbsp; But he does feel like... buying a massage for her, as soon as he's got any 'gold pieces'?&nbsp; That seems like the blatantly obvious solution -</p>
              <p>The thought of a stranger touching Carissa's naked body does not feel especially pleasant.</p>
              <p>Keltham is not <em>used</em> to his brain working like this, and it's causing his self-model to stumble over itself repeatedly.</p>
              <p>...he could pay one of the other girls to give Carissa a massage&nbsp;<em>from</em> him?</p>
              <p>For that matter, if he doesn't have any gold yet, he could tell Ione to do it after she's recovered.</p>
              <p>Is Keltham allowed to <em>do</em> that, does it count as something Ione offered him?</p>
              <p>Well, Keltham doesn't have any massive anti-legibility issues with Ione, so he can just <em>ask,</em> which will make his life massively simpler.&nbsp; Keltham's guess is that Ione's objection, if she has any, will be that Carissa might ask what got traded to Ione for the massage, and Ione doesn't want to mention the Nethys thing to Carissa.&nbsp; But they could just tell Carissa it's a secret, so that doesn't seem like a problem?</p>
              <p>Seems like a plan.</p>

              <p>While he stutters, rapid messages delivered by magic where Keltham can't hear:</p>

              <p>Asmodeus has given them a directive to move Keltham to a new location, one that will somehow be more protected from divine interference than even the palace, as soon as Aspexia can get a new Forbiddance spell and put that up tomorrow at dawn.&nbsp; They're not to spare any expense, this time; Cheliax is suddenly wealthier than expected, for reasons to be described later.</p>
              <p>The anti-interference divine protection <em>should </em>prevent any more oracles from being created, even if someone on site isn't soul-sold.</p>
              <p>Maillol is still recovering.&nbsp; Sevar's input is requested in Maillol's place about the new project setup.&nbsp; Possibly Keltham's input should be solicited too?</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Two of the Securities peel off as soon as they're out of sight of Keltham's door and get on with their real jobs.&nbsp; The remaining one escorts Carissa to a room where she can review her notes, and hands her a sealed packet that contain the Queen's slightly censored transcript of Keltham's thoughts.<br><br></p>
              <p>The Security also recounts recent events at somewhat greater length.</p>
              <p>Rather a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of diamonds suddenly materialized around Otolmens's oracle.</p>
              <p>There's an obvious thought about where those diamonds might have come from, and their best hopes there seem to be actually coming true.&nbsp; Nidal shifted to a more tightly defensive, conservative, and dare one hope, <em>worried</em> posture afterwards.&nbsp; It's not the same kind of game-over as if Zon-Kuthon had been destroyed and his clerics depowered, but the remaining timeline is looking like months, not years.</p>
              <p>Nobody has any good idea of <em>how</em> Nidal managed to piss off Otolmens this much, except, obviously, that it had something to do with Nidal's intentions for Keltham.&nbsp; It nonetheless implies that people should tread <em>even more carefully,</em> which shouldn't, in fact, be possible in the first place when you are dealing with an Otolmens event, but nonetheless, do consider, this is what happens when Otolmens gets <em>pissed.</em>&nbsp; If anybody manages to piss Otolmens off <em>at Cheliax instead,</em> then perhaps all the diamonds in Cheliax will be teleported to Lastwall!&nbsp; It is the considered belief of Grand High Priestess Aspexia Rugatonn that this would be a bad idea, and people should not do it!&nbsp; Or come close to doing it.&nbsp; Or think too much about doing it.&nbsp; Or do anything that is 'not technically doing it'.&nbsp; Or do something that really shouldn't piss Otolmens off <em>that </em>much if Otolmens is being reasonable.&nbsp; Just don't, fucking, mess, with Otolmens.&nbsp; If anybody thinks that Rugatonn is trying to tell them anything especially complicated here, they should come to Rugatonn for clarification about how she is really, in fact, saying something very simple.&nbsp; Or they can just kill themselves directly.&nbsp; Rugatonn is happy with either outcome.</p>
              <p>Maillol, who received Asmodeus's vision while being personally tortured by Gorthoklek, briefly and barely pulled himself together to communicate the bones of their Lord's vision:&nbsp; Asmodeus communicated a complex attitude about Otolmens's sudden gift, which suggests that Otolmens has well overpaid for the new project to have adequate security precautions; and while they shouldn't even remotely try to spend as much as Otolmens actually paid, they're not supposed to just take the money and run, either.</p>
              <p>The new project location will have <em>actual fucking security</em> this time, and any complaints about the budget should be considered in the light of Otolmens's apparent concern and corresponding generosity.</p>
              <p>Asmodeus's sent vision requires very strongly that Keltham needs to be not too far from Ostenso.&nbsp; Asmodeus's vision implies that Keltham should be within the designated region the moment it's safe; so as soon as a new Forbiddance can be put up, somewhere Nidal hopefully won't know about; hence, shortly after dawn tomorrow when Rugatonn can request a Forbiddance spell.</p>
              <p>They're currently thinking of renovating an old coastal fortress.</p>

              <p>Carissa's preferred thing to tell Keltham about this is the truth, that Cheliax is acting on orders from Otolmens; she thinks that Keltham is more likely to break rules in a way that offends Otolmens accidentally than he is to do so deliberately, and if he were doing it deliberately he'd likely at least take cautionary measures like running it by Carissa first or maybe talking to Broom. Otolmens intervention seems like the sort of thing that might be clearer from Keltham's perspective than theirs and which is therefore going to end up being even harder to hide. She assumes Aspexia Rugatonn will veto this, so she wants to give a story that <em>isn't incompatible&nbsp;</em>with telling him that later, which probably means just telling him that the relocation is for Security reasons they can't disclose at this time.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa would appreciate a further briefing on known things about Otolmens, at some point.</p>
              <p>Coastal fortress seems fine. Keltham seems plenty attached to luxury, even knowing how desperately poor everyone in the world is; she isn't sure if it'll actually hit him for Evil if they fund his luxuries with brutal taxation of some distant village but it seems worth exploring. Plumbing is a must.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She assumes from the fact the packet is sealed that she is intended to read it alone.</p>

              <p>Security also notes that Cheliax, of course, acts on only Asmodeus's orders, even if Asmodeus perhaps bargains with other gods as part of His business; even Otolmens surely would not dare to <em>instruct</em> Him so, or give Him <em>orders</em> to pass along, and the generosity of Her payment suggests that She bargained with Asmodeus from a position of weakness.&nbsp; To suggest that Cheliax is in any way acting on <em>Otolmens's orders</em> would be a lie, which Sevar is welcome to authorize explicitly.&nbsp; (Weirdly, Security does not hurt her about this.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Hmm. With approval from the Grand High Priestess, she wants them to tell Keltham that their present understanding is that Broom's god of messes requested the move and heightened security generally, and that Asmodeus instructed it, and maybe even that the instruction was specifically to go somewhere near Ostenso. The most obviously useful thing here is Keltham being reluctant to leave the area, though mostly Carissa's operating on the assumption that this has weird correlates she can't see.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>And she'll take a look at the transcript now. She does not ask if that means her mind won't be read while she reads it; it might instead just mean her mind is being read directly by Abrogail or something, and anyway 'my mind isn't presently being read' is a bad starting point for thought.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Abrogail's transcript contains a censored section right at the most exciting part about the Second Law, with notes saying that Keltham thought things about other people's knowledge of these truths driving them insane and possibly collapsing the universe, that most of his thoughts were incomprehensible ideas with no remote conceptual neighbors in any language that Abrogail knows, and that the parts that did make it through were incredibly fucking disturbing.&nbsp; Abrogail is obviously saying this because she knows how terribly curious it will make Sevar about the one part she most wanted to know, <em>but it is also true</em>, and Rugatonn requires further thought on whether Sevar gets to see this.</p>
              <p>Abrogail has included a more detailed explanation of why Sevar is being tortured, with particular torture codes from her sheet being noted at particular points that all sum up exactly to the total amount of torture she received in her original note.</p>
              <p>The most severe torture code is annotated on the section where Keltham thought about his secret plan to establish a fully legible meta-level signal via the no-verbal-objections order.&nbsp; This looks like a huge setback for their corruption plans.&nbsp; If Sevar noticed this at all, which was <em>her </em>job, then she didn't think about it in words and it didn't show up in her thought transcript, meaning Abrogail got blindsided here.&nbsp; Abrogail isn't sure how to recover, Sevar didn't say anything to the effect of how most masochists wouldn't go along with it even if Sevar herself is fine, or how she could do it for a month no problem but after any longer of not being allowed to scream and beg she would probably start to feel sad.&nbsp; Maybe when Keltham gets to the appropriate point Sevar can confess that she's starting to feel sad.&nbsp; Keltham is unfortunately <em>explicitly suspicious</em> that Cheliax is trying to lure him into rape.&nbsp; But even if Sevar's opinion is that any objection to Keltham's plan would have made him too suspicious, Sevar didn't apparently notice, and definitely didn't report it explicitly.&nbsp; Bad Sevar, go to your torture room.</p>
              <p>The second-worst torture code is for Sevar thinking about how the Queen of Cheliax was being <em>stupid </em>for saying a 'worse version' than the one Sevar suggested.&nbsp; When, in fact, the Queen of Cheliax has higher Perception than Sevar can fucking dream of and it was warning her off Sevar's version verbatim, possibly because Keltham would've been able to identify it as coming from Sevar.&nbsp; Sevar's failure to <em>imagine</em> that the Queen of Cheliax could have any good reason for <em>presuming to not do exactly what Sevar said</em> reveals an actual problem of subordination here and that's why this punishment is severe.&nbsp; Thinking about lighting Abrogail on fire despite knowing you might get punished for thinking that was not the problem, that's just flirting and will be dealt with separately.</p>
              <p>The third-severest torture code, also appearing in the original sum of codes Carissa was given, is the fee for making the fucking Queen of Cheliax spell all this out for Sevar in the annotations because Sevar apparently cannot imagine her Queen ever being professional about anything.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>- okay, you know what, that's actually completely reasonable. And it's true that Carissa has been having a hard time imagining her Queen being professional about anything, though in her defense, that's because -</p>
              <p>- well, the thing Keltham said, about how a pragmatic person in the Queen's position would simply have sex with someone other than Carissa.</p>
              <p>But. The Queen is who she is, and wants what she wants, and is clearly quite good at her job while wanting some things that offer constraints on how she does her job, and Carissa was in fact underrating that, internally, assuming the Queen was less capable than she was, and the punishment is warranted, and she should have assumed the punishment would be warranted. She'll get it done before she leaves for a coastal fortress in Ostenso.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She's extremely annoyed about the part she really wants being censored, but she thinks nonetheless she understands the Second Law stuff well enough to be working around, now, and well enough to be considering some strategies like saying dramatically ironic things that have no payoff at all because reality doesn't actually pay attention to dramatic irony. (Keltham made a&nbsp;<em>face,&nbsp;</em>when she asserted she wasn't a Kuthite spy.)</p>
              <p>She has several ideas for working around the no-order thing, though she didn't see what Keltham was playing at until the transcript and isn't delighted by it. Firstly, she's not actually sure that it wouldn't ding a person for Evil, if they are in the habit of ordering their slaves not to refuse them and vaguely intend that, if ever disobeyed about that, they'd stop the game and let the slave go. In Carissa's particular case it's going to be more complicated but as a general order Keltham's in the habit of giving it seems in some ways advantageous; maybe they can arrange for him to give that order to someone else who 1) will understand Keltham's intent as the obvious 'you are not entitled to refuse me, so don't', 2) has adequate self-control and won't in fact trigger it and 3) (this one might be inconvenient) will react with arousal to treatment they desperately wish they weren't subject to. And then make it gradually clearer to Keltham over time that the reason he's being obeyed is because he's entitled to obedience, not because it's sexy per se. Secondly, Carissa's planning to eventually raise with Keltham that always following orders is in fact less sexy than sometimes breaking orders and being suitably punished for that, so hopefully he can just not-update the orders about 'no' as they gradually transition to a model where he doesn't have her obedience so much as the right and means to compel it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Can someone alert Carissa please when Maillol's competent to take over project duties, and in the mean time hand her any project related work that's been sitting, so she can hand it off to him in relatively good shape while she goes for her punishment?</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(She's not scared, even though she's definitely never had half an hour before and knows this kind of thing is not linear in effects. That would be pathetic, and she's not that pathetic.)</p>

              <p>"I think the three main conditions, here, are, one, getting to know the Queen of Cheliax like at all, two, figuring out whether Carissa is all right with this, in a way that doesn't just trigger 'hey you can run a sword through me and this isn't even a sword so I'll be fine', and three is, uh, complicated.&nbsp; Any thoughts about one or two before we tackle that.&nbsp; I don't get the impression that I can just ask Carissa if she's fine with being rented, or can I?"</p>

              <p>"I - think Carissa has some equivalent of what a dath ilani would call 'dignity', which translates via Share Language to Taldane dignity but I suspect is really not the same thing at all.&nbsp; Carissa's 'dignity' is that she is impossible to truly hurt, even by running a sword through her and then refusing to Raise her, which is what makes it safe for the man to whom she's completely given herself to do anything he wants with her, and not be afraid."</p>

              <p>"If I try to discuss this with my Carissamodel, my Carissamodel says back that Chelish dignity also says that it's her place to safeguard her own safety and not rely on anybody else to protect her when she's giving herself away, that it would be undignified for her to be relying on me to think about her safety.&nbsp; I don't then feel happy and reassured when my Carissamodel says this back to me, and I don't know where to go from there."</p>

              <p>An observation that might be useful to Keltham is that - by the standards of dath ilan, it's plausible that almost no one is competent to know what they actually want and what they can withstand, and yet they do still have to make decisions and do things, and it can simultaneously be true that they might be wrong and that it is impossible to do better than treating them as if they're right, until one encounters actual reason to think they're specifically wrong about something specific; trust withheld in full generality can be damaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Another might be that one commonly solves this by hurting their Carissa to her breaking point such that they subsequently know what it is, and Keltham probably literally isn't capable of that yet, but the fact he's not also means this isn't very urgent.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Ah, Keltham. Carissa thinks her preferred phrasing might've been better in that regard but yields to Abrogail's superior Splendour. It's like - it's like if the thing you're trying to do is figure out who to send on patrol, and if someone brings up that those two just had a bad breakup and won't get along, your job isn't convincing them they're <em>wrong</em>, it's <em>figuring out what the best patrol group is with the new inputs</em>. Act like the decision power is already yours and you don't need to convince anyone, and then like you need the patrol to nonetheless perform well against demons.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>One objection to what Abrogail just said is that it proves too much, Keltham shouldn't buy and abuse literal children (yes he should but they're not going to get him there yet). So it might be worth acknowledging his concerns as perhaps outweighing her clever response in some cases, but pointing out that Carissa was judged competent by her society to swear the Worldwound oath, which is as competent as her society is capable of acknowledging her to be, and so even if one doesn't want to declare everyone competent until proven otherwise they could extend it at least to those who've served at the Lawfullest place in Golarion.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(Modulo carefulness to not come across as too good at reading Keltham, but Abrogail knows that.)</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>What is the meaning of an oath is a hard question for us to answer, with our vocabulary, but it doesn't mean that oaths only mean to us their most obvious physical consequence, and many people who one way or another don't fear Abaddon still give their word and mean it, groping for a different basis for it to signify what it does.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There's really something to be said for doing things and checking whether they have good or bad consequences, assuming the consequences are recoverable.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Also he could just directly bring this to Carissa, she'll in fact probably be upset and definitely at least somewhat turned-off but that's only a consideration against it, not absolute reason if he's too stuck.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(She's...better at self-deception than most people, it's pretty obvious by now; her self-deceptions go deeper, grow more roots. She didn't just learn to quash the thought 'Abrogail makes mistakes', she uprooted everything nearby, replaced with 'you are too ignorant of the constraints on Abrogail to ever evaluate anything she does as a mistake'.)</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa has only tried being emotional at Keltham once and what happened was that he decided he needed to invent contraception about her sadness, it was very confusing, Isidre should be glad he's not handling Isidre's emotions like that. Maybe dath ilan encourages that because they don't want their people emotionally manipulable and also don't want them to learn to simply not care about other people.</p>

              <p>That hypothesis makes this more valuable to you as a test of his tropes theory though you understand why he wouldn't see it that way. You have lots of observations about how incredibly implausible it'd be for the Queen to steal Carissa, but you aren't sure how they hold up in tropeworld. In the actual, logical world, though, incredibly unlikely.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Also, though he has good reason to put this line of thought on hold, the Queen would absolutely respect a preexisting arrangement, even if things are running on...tropes...she couldn't be the Queen of Cheliax if she broke a preexisting agreement between Keltham and Cheliax over Carissa, such as that she is his.</p>

              <p>"I think that sane people occasionally take time off from running their country to sleep with people they are actually attracted to," Isidre says.</p>
              <p><br>Intuitions only partly magical tell Abrogail that Isidre needs to make this statement incredibly blatantly sharp for a Chelish person, so that it will come across as slightly sharp to Keltham.&nbsp; Abrogail sends a side note to Sevar about how the very blatant sharpness is deliberate, and why it's there; Sevar may need to note for her own future that Keltham may need very loud signals for them to be perceptible to him at all, that's going to take some practice to calibrate right.</p>
              <p>Are Sevar's thoughts by any chance flirtatious right now, in the sense that Sevar is thinking things she knows will get her punished.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Her sincere honest answer is that Keltham is more - something, the phrase she immediately thought of is 'terrifyingly creative' but she's 100% sure she will regret with great intensity having questioned the Queen of Cheliax's terrifying creativity - more dath ilani, the space of solutions he draws from is larger and once he gets competent he'll be able to use the Golarion pool too - he clearly thought he had a way of doing safe Wishes that might work and she can't even tell him he's obviously wrong -</p>
              <p>- anyway, he's more <em>something </em>than the Queen of Cheliax and the Queen of Cheliax would beat him without trying in a ruthlessness contest or a solving your problems with any of murder petrification and mind control contest, but Asmodeus has committed to letting Keltham leave Cheliax alive and in one piece, and given that she thinks Keltham would win this contest, if both of them were trying. And also it's obviously not in Cheliax's interests to let it come to that, though it's maybe in Cheliax's interests to make Keltham realize that he does, actually, want to be the person who would have absolute power over Carissa even if he doesn't quite yet want to exercise it.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Tell him if he'll walk out over me then he does win. And that - caring that much about me - is indeed something the Queen can't compete with, and the key to Carissa's sexuality, or as close to it as a person who still runs into a wall of Good every time he tries to have desires can comprehend it.</p>

              <p>Well.&nbsp; It's clear enough that Sevar thinks that Keltham has already won this contest, and with it her heart; so the question then becomes, does Abrogail Thrune choose to permit Sevar to go on believing that, and to convince Keltham of it too.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"That Carissa's sexuality depends on the <em>truth</em> of two propositions that can't both simultaneously be true is, itself, very much a 'trope', and one of the deepest and most powerful ones.&nbsp; Even more than the Queen of Cheliax being a <em>complication</em>, even more than her coming into <em>conflict </em>with me, the deepest 'trope' here has to be the <em>question-of-fact</em>, what is really true.&nbsp; Everything else fell into place once I realized that."</p>
              <p>"My proposal is as simple as it is unfair to the Queen.&nbsp; If I meet her and know her and think she's worthy of Carissa at all, I offer to negotiate the rental agreement for Carissa.&nbsp; In front of her advisors.&nbsp; And with Carissa there to see it, because she's the one who has to know this truth and witness it.&nbsp; I say plainly" (a dath ilani does not bother to add 'and truthfully' if they're bothering to let words leave their mouth at all) "that I'm worried about a more experienced sadist stealing Carissa from me, and if the Queen of Cheliax does that successfully, I will walk out on Cheliax and go make a revolution somewhere else.&nbsp; I say that I want guarantees about my right, signed by the government of Cheliax and by the Queen and by the Church of Asmodeus in whatever capacity Asmodeus recognizes such things, to take Carissa with me if that happens, potentially including against her own will, if I so choose, to somewhere that puts enough value on a dath ilani to also recognize my possession of her."</p>
              <p>"Having that right doesn't mean I'd actually exercise it, obviously, but nobody needs to say that in front of the Queen; and while Carissa might know what I wouldn't really do, I think she'll also understand the romantic gesture in the spirit in which it was intended."</p>
              <p>"If everybody's being sane, the Queen and her advisors are like, sure, sounds weirdly extreme but he's obviously doing it to impress his girlfriend, they sign on like the totally sane grownups they are.&nbsp; The limits on the Queen's sadism are in a sealed section of the compact that I trust you to write.&nbsp; The conflict <em>and the 'trope'</em> have been defused, easily enough to call into severe question whether there was ever really any 'trope' at work in the first place."</p>
              <p>"If the Queen is like, why, no, how could I possibly do <em>that</em>, I have strange reasons I cannot do <em>that</em>, then we know she's a giant 'trope' avatar and there's a foretold path of conflict and complication whose core question-of-truth is who Carissa Sevar really belongs to - both de facto and in terms of her core sexuality, because those two are the same thing."</p>
              <p>"In which case, obviously, I stop negotiating that rental agreement, get back to my new research installation, and both we and the Queen's advisers do everything we can to keep the Queen and Carissa apart for as long as possible.&nbsp; We do everything we can to, like, totally slow down all of that from actually happening, if that is at <em>all</em> possible, and try to delay everything into the future as far as possible, because, like, I already have a job."</p>
              <p>"Eventually either the Queen loses power, or the two of us reconcile and kiss, or, if I screw up along the way, the Queen wins and Cheliax stays poor for longer.&nbsp; Or Golarion ends up falling to the Worldwound because there wasn't really anywhere else that could offer the resources that Cheliax and Asmodeus could.&nbsp; I suppose there's other possibilities within the 'tropes' that would then almost have to be governing, but I'd have to think hard about what they were; they'd be less probable."</p>

              <p>Her reasoning is not complicated; why, Sevar herself might see it if Sevar had the requisite +6 headband of all mental attributes.</p>
              <p>Keltham thinks he's describing a future event that he has to arrange in accordance with 'tropes'.&nbsp; That event has&nbsp;<em>already happened, without Keltham knowing it.</em>&nbsp; He has been fighting the true Queen this entire time, in front of Carissa, and, apparently to Carissa for now, won.</p>
              <p>In dath ilan's rhythm of prediction, success, credibility, that is a victory he has won.</p>
              <p>Abrogail has worked out by now a wordless sort of apprehension as to what sort of things 'tropes' are, namely, things out of stories, except that they're not the 'tropes' of Cheliax or Golarion, they're the 'tropes' of dath ilan.&nbsp; But if dath ilan has, per transcript, girls who dream of becoming Dark Unilateral Rulers, then dath ilan surely <em>also </em>has a 'trope' for appearing to have won when you haven't, because the person you're fighting is smarter than you and you never knew how many of your plans were known to her from the beginning.</p>
              <p>More the fool Keltham, if that thought hasn't occurred to him; and more the fool Carissa, if, knowing the true place of the Queen of Cheliax in all of this, it hasn't occurred to her to wonder the same.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>...or she could just not decide to do any of that, and then her life wouldn't be a 'trope'.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Possibly then there wouldn't be any 'tropes' around at all, she's not sure how that works.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Ice and fire alternate, in an unoccupied room nearby.&nbsp; Cycling between the two prevents the floors and walls from melting; it's not Abrogail's first time venting emotion where her adversaries will not see that and be warned.</p>

              <p>In the end, the logic behind Abrogail's last decision here is simple.</p>
              <p>She doesn't actually want to spend the rest of her life like this.</p>
              <p>She'd rather not be a 'trope'.</p>
              <p>In fact, she now <em>deeply </em>desires that there be no 'tropes' anywhere near Cheliax.&nbsp; Ever.</p>
              <p>And while she's not quite sure that this is how any of this works, she's going to do her part there.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"Well, then," Isidre says, and sighs.&nbsp; "I suppose you should go back and talk to Carissa and determine how she feels about being rented to the Queen, and I should see if you can meet the Queen at least briefly.&nbsp; And then maybe move directly to the confrontation with her and her advisors in sight of Carissa, then or very soon after.&nbsp; If everyone is sane, which I <em>do </em>expect them to be, Keltham, it should actually get done quite quickly - or I certainly hope so, because these are all very busy people.&nbsp; But time today is no more time than time tomorrow, and if possible we may as well get this done while we can do it without burning Teleports."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"Is your proposal here that we read in a couple hundred people on everything we know about the secret that may have started the godwar.... so that the betting markets resolve."</p>
              <p><br>"Yes," the Prince Merenre says. "Precisely because something about the situation may have started a godwar. It's important, so we need to be competent to reason about it, so the betting markets need to be something more than a fancy layer of fuzziness on top of all my personal guesses."</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I trust precisely thirty people with this," says the pharaoh of Osirion. "And all of them know better than to bet against you, ever, about anything where they don't have inside information."</p>
              <p><br>"In principle we can fix that with more lopsided payoffs," says Merenre. "They can't be infinitely confident in my being better than them."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I predict their bets-against-you will cluster around yours, if they're allowed to know yours, and maybe even if they aren't. What I want here is people who'll think of something you haven't. And less of a&nbsp;<em>spread - </em>because come on,&nbsp; this is ridiculous -"</p>
              <p>"Where are the markets at right now?" a serious, stiff-robed priest asks.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Our&nbsp;<em>eighty percent confidence interval&nbsp;</em>spans 'totally useless except to Abadar and three mathematicians' to 'the destruction of the multiverse'".</p>
              <p>"- how are they even resolving that -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, the usual. That's not the point, the point is, I can't govern like this."</p>
              <p><br>"What if we get predictors from Axis," says the King-Consort. "They've got better participation than us, there's a convenient list of exactly who to ask-"</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Can't afford them."</p>
              <p>"If this project is as important as the 50th percentile projection, we can give them the Sphinx."</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "- there's a policy proposal, I guess, raffle off every archeological relic in the country, except our God in his wisdom has copies of all of them already -"</p>
              <p><br>"Can you ask Him to pay to subsidize the prediction markets in Aktun?" says Merenre tiredly. This is technically a breach of protocol - they're not supposed to acknowledge, even in private, that the person of the pharaoh is not the person of Abadar Himself - but it's been a long two days since they first learned from Abadar of a complicated situation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We subsidize all the prediction markets in Aktun," says the pharaoh, who is not actually the person of Abadar Himself but is closer than most mortals come, and doesn't use the 'we' just as an affectation. "There's still the security question." There are reasons that sometimes when there are ongoing wars you don't just subsidize a bunch of public markets.</p>
              <p><br>Fe-Anar, the Pharaoh's father, mutters a phrase in the fast-changing language of the Maelstrom which no one who doesn't talk to proteans at least weekly, or have permanent Tongues, could hope to understand; it translates approximately to 'lol fuck the security question'.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pharaoh has permanent Tongues, and also did not need it to know what his father was going to say there. "One thing We would pay a lot to resolve is 'odds that Osirion and Cheliax end up at war over this," he says sharply, "and I expect Hell would also observe that with fascination. And while We don't find the arguments for squishing anomalies before they change Golarion persuasive, obviously, and are appalled that that's been policy for so many millenia, obviously, We're trading with a lot of entities that do find those concerns persuasive. But really We'd make it all public in Axis, subject to some standard nondisclosure agreements, if it weren't obviously an avenue for interference by Hell."</p>
              <p><br>"They've got to have their own predictions."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Only relevant market public in Hell is the one for the souls of some various adjacent parties, which, uh, keeps getting more expensive, I don't know how to interpret that exactly -"</p>
              <p><br>Fe-Anar mutters a phrase in the fast-changing language of the Maelstrom which translates best to 'fuck Hell'.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Amen," says everyone else, fervently; they keep on top of how the Maelstrom says that one.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><br>"Is there not," says Merenre, "some kind of ordinary Aktun market participation contract understood to be robust against Hell - really I'm astonished that all Aktun market participation contracts aren't understood to be robust against Hell -"</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"They're robust in the sense that if they're fucking around, We'll take their money, in the long run."</p>
              <p><br>"And that long run is measured in - transaction volume? What goes wrong if we just subsidize it."</p>
              <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That long run is measured in transaction volume and also in time for arbitration courts to make them eat penalty clauses that're still financial in nature -"</p>
              <p><br>"So pay the courts to work inside a time-dilated demiplane. With all earned respect, &nbsp;if this has a one in ten chance of being as important as it looks, you aren't spending enough money on it!"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I literally cannot afford to spend money on ten things like this, so I need some way to figure out which one is going to get me more than a math textbook!"</p>
              <p><br>"The arbitration courts do already run at whatever speed is necessary for them to resolve in the contractually obligatory time. That's a month sidereal, for current events prediction markets," observes a sparkling ball of gears floating above one of the conference-table seats.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><br>"Do they promise they won't speed up and start settling everything overnight?"</p>
              <p><br>"They do not," says the sparkling ball of gears, with what might be faint amusement.<br>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"First prediction market," says the King-Consort. "Pay a hundred top performers in Axis with a share of future returns from the work of Abadar's new cleric, to get up to speed and then predict what'll go wrong if we make the betting open in Axis and try to beat Hell at what is, in the end, our game, more than theirs."</p>
              <p><br>"The future returns from the project aren't ours."</p>
              <p>"The cleric's ours -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The cleric's - so it's not clear he&nbsp;<em>is,&nbsp;</em>is the thing, Abadar's tried to show me what He's looking at but I don't understand it, and I certainly don't know that he considers himself to have entered into a trade relationship with us where we can conditionally commit his resources according to our model of what he'll be willing to pay for later -"</p>
              <p>"A share of future returns from the project conditional on the target agreeing that this market served his interests -"</p>
              <p><br>"Not to harp on this too much, but, all of what was just proposed plus 'inside time-dilation', we're already later to this than I'd like because of the Zon-Kuthon war -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Because of the Zon-Kuthon war We have fewer resources to run bits of Aktun in time-dilation than We'd like."</p>
              <p>"Can you put numbers, when you say things like that, like, precisely how much time-dilation can we have at what multiplier on its usual cost."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I really can't."</p>
              <p>"I mean, give me an order of magnitude -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "If Abadar were able to put orders of magnitude in His visions then We would have so many fewer problems!"</p>
              <p><br>"Proposal: a communication to the target in Cheliax to the effect 'subsidizing prediction market in Aktun, evaluate policy questions relevant to you with promised share project returns, reply yes no"</p>
              <p><br>"Cheliax is we believe committed to not murdering him if in their evaluation he starts to look dangerous to their interests but they're neither above nor prohibited from neglecting to prevent his capture by Nidal.

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>...that means she should also probably take her punishment before she goes back to Keltham, and she's currently in the wrong mental state for it, namely euphoric and full of giddy terror, but she's not actually the out-of-control child Abrogail seems to think, she can talk herself around. She trots over to the temple and contemplates dath ilani Lawful Evil, which they do tell stories about apparently, Evil Keepers who wield the Law for their own benefit. She wants to be that. Cheliax doesn't understand dath ilan but it does understand how to harden Evil in someone's heart, how to turn human weaknesses in so they feed Evil impulses not Good ones. She needs that. And she deserves punishment, because she erred, and doesn't want to blunder through the world unpunished until she faces the ultimate punishment for an error too big to overlook. Asmodeus said to punish her as his Law requires, because otherwise she'll err too far before reality shows up to correct her.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Keltham has her childish, stupid heart, because he's rich and powerful and willing to walk away from Cheliax over her and it's very cute, but Cheliax owns her body and soul, and this is, in the evaluation of a system designed for punishing weakness and building Evil in human hearts, what she needs.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>There, that's better. She will just have to not let all that Asmodean conviction be shaken by the sight of Maillol.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>It's the second most physically painful experience of her life, and opening Abrogail's gift bag earlier helps a lot to appreciate how much it could be worse.&nbsp; Unlike Abrogail's bag, which is meant to amuse Abrogail to think of it, disciplinary torture is meant to educate and improve the soul and not <em>just</em> be pleasing to Asmodeus.</p>
              <p>They show you what's coming, to let you contemplate your error.&nbsp; They apply it only somewhat painfully at first, so you can still think coherently about your mistake, and fear how much worse it's going to get, and regret, and then they make it worse and worse to drive the behavior firmly out of you, once you've had that chance to fix in your mind what you did wrong and how much you regret it.</p>
              <p>If you want your pain to mean something, if you want to relate productively to your own torture and suffering, Asmodeus's torturers are doing all the right things to make sure you can.&nbsp; At least if you've been sent in for corrective torture, and not this-is-the-fate-you-should-have-feared-and-now-you-have-earned-it torture.</p>
              <p>The Queen's order calls for the corrective sort of torture.&nbsp; It's a good thing that happened before Abrogail became less optimistic about whether Sevar could be salvaged, or more personally annoyed with her.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>It lasts a lot longer. At least Carissa thinks so, she never actually asked how long the bag lasted. This had a duration written neatly on the scroll she turned in. And she's pretty sure it's longer, because her voice is much, much hoarser, and her face much stickier with snot and tears, and she gets <em>tired,&nbsp;</em>in a way she doesn't think she has before, random uninjured muscles screaming about having been tense for so long.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It'll be worse in Hell.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She understands her mistakes better. She won't make them again. There isn't another way to get this result; dath ilan tries to do everything with rewards, but that just builds stunted little Good people who'd <em>go to Abaddon</em> rather than not get their fair share of a deal.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa would never, ever go to Abaddon. If you told her this was all that was left to her forever, more of this, she wouldn't go to Abaddon. She is strong where the people of dath ilan are weak; she can live in worlds they can't.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She hopes someone is reading her mind because she requests healing adequate to conceal signs of injury from Keltham but can't seem to make her mouth move right now.</p>

              <p>The common sense of dath ilan says to, like, think dangerous things through before you do dangerous things, not try to improvise them as you go.&nbsp; Especially when you have two more Truthspells, to use later if needed - shit he should've cast Augury before he tried that, oh well, he'll get used to having magic eventually.</p>

"Did you use one with Isidre, that <em>might&nbsp;</em>have been faked, she's powerful enough to cast that anti-Enchantment spell that your god gave you for the Kuthites and I bet she knows it.

            <div class='post-content'><p>There are some sights you see very rarely in Golarion, and one of those sights is the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus clutching a sheaf of parchments and laughing so hard there are tears in her eyes and she's having to physically lean against the wall and is probably going to hit herself with Lesser Restoration when this is over to make up for how much she isn't breathing and all of these paroxysms are making her stomach physically hurt but none of this matters because Aspexia Rugatonn has now reached the part where Keltham is completely innocently explaining to the Queen of Cheliax that if she doesn't act like a fucking sane person for once in her entire life she will be either unceremoniously removed from the throne or forced to become his girlfriend.<br><br></p>
              <p>That... might not be such a bad idea actually?&nbsp; Though not in <em>that</em> sense, of course.</p>
              <p>It's just that Keltham - for all his headstrongness, his errors, his delusions, his total spoilation and lack of discipline bestowed by his Lawful Good society's insanely permissive upbringing - still in other ways radiates a powerful impression that... well.&nbsp; &nbsp;That he could not only understand Aspexia's notion of 'corrigibility' after three minutes of explanation, but would possibly even invent it all himself the moment he understood what Asmodeus's own problems were like as seen from His perspective.</p>
              <p>They have no idea what dath ilani halfbloods will be like, at this point.&nbsp; But depending on how they turn out, if they can keep half of all that Law and be raised also Evil, it's plausible that the Church of Asmodeus would really, really, and by 'Church of Asmodeus' Aspexia Rugatonn here means 'Aspexia Rugatonn', really, really, <em>really</em> want somebody on the throne of Cheliax who could understand the concept of 'corrigibility'.</p>
              <p>Abrogail Thrune II's compact with Asmodeus says that, while she can bear any number of potential heirs to men of her own choosing, the Church may twice ask of her a father of the Church's own choosing.&nbsp; As for who inherits, that is something that only a compact with Asmodeus can decide.</p>
              <p>The Church hasn't asked that of Abrogail, so far, because there's been no candidate that would be worth the amount of fuss they'd get.&nbsp; Abrogail's compact says that she needs to do it, but the incompetent devil who framed that compact unfortunately did <em>not </em>specify that Abrogail needed to act professional about receiving such a request.&nbsp; Rather a massive oversight, as it turned out, among many others.&nbsp; So far Abrogail has borne no children at all; but this is not a national problem, there are other Thrunes who could compact with Asmodeus.</p>
              <p>Aspexia Rugatonn will have to seriously consider whether she wants to <em>actually </em>do this, or just threaten to do it in order to witness the look on Abrogail's face.&nbsp; Those are the only two options, to be clear, there is no third.</p>
              <p>But first she's going to finish reading.</p>

              <p>If one of those agenda items was causing the downfall of another god, he'd treat it no differently than any other.&nbsp; Gods, to Keltham, are things to be coordinated-with; and if they <em>don't </em>coordinate, they have to be put down, first temporarily by other gods, and then permanently by the eventual Civilization that Zon-Kuthon feared and that Keltham sees an opportunity to build.</p>
              <p>He's stranger, and maybe a tiny bit scarier, when he thinks about matters on a larger scale than his woman Carissa.&nbsp; Finding himself in a world with gods is no different to him from finding himself in a world with fish; they are both just ordinary real things to him once he knows they exist.</p>

              <p>Keltham's private thoughts?&nbsp; Exactly the same as what he says aloud; there is no dishonesty in him, no dishonesty at all, when it comes to trade.&nbsp; That's not because he's nice, but because he knows what fairness is and will not lightly brook any departure from it, whether by himself or any other.&nbsp; In that sense, if in very few others, this young man could pass as an ordinary cleric of Abadar.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham's thoughts show sincerity (of course, he's a cleric of Abadar negotiating a trade deal with somebody who hasn't visibly betrayed him yet) and some not especially Golarion-comprehensible thoughts about logarithmic <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">utility-functions</span> if you're spending money on yourself. &nbsp;Abrogail does know what a logarithm is, but the connection in Keltham's thoughts is not clear.</p>
              <p>"If you were willing to take some of your share of the gains in a public investment fund that stayed in Cheliax, it would potentially simplify some political problems for us."&nbsp; And also probably be the sort of thing that's much easier to contractually yoink, if Keltham tries to leave.</p>
              <p>Abrogail does have some thoughts about how Keltham's gains, if he tries to leave, could be made payable to him 'in the standard backing of value for Chelish currency'.&nbsp; The trouble is, that gets caught by that incredibly audacious clause he innocently dared to offer Lrilatha about avoiding terms expected to have unexpected unpleasant consequences.&nbsp; If Keltham's departure leaves behind most of his gains in the form of a Cheliax-only investment fund, if they can get away with including that clear and understood term, it might save Cheliax quite a lot of loss.</p>

              <p>Did she doom herself to 'trope'hood by <em>that</em> not happening in front of Sevar?&nbsp; She doesn't think so; that was a duel between herself and Keltham and not one that was really over possession of Carissa at all.</p>
              <p>Well.&nbsp; Perhaps Sevar's thought was correct, perhaps everyone but her underestimates Keltham; he is doing better than she expected, even now.&nbsp; But at least to Abrogail, it seems like Keltham does flirt very close to the edges of losing his games and damning himself in one sense or another.&nbsp; He just needs to be encouraged to go on playing them.</p>
              <p>The Queen sighs.&nbsp; "I suppose we could have it be - the kind of favors owed that are understood not to be enforceable even in the eyes of Asmodeus?&nbsp; I am a little friendlier to you for borrowing Sevar, you are a little friendlier to me for making you look good in front of her."</p>

              <p>It is <em>infuriating</em> that the child has gotten herself into a vital position where she needs to be accommodated for incompetence like that, rather than it being turned into a more object lesson.&nbsp; But they're planning to try out Lrilatha running Suggestion on Keltham; and while that is expected to go well, Sevar needs to be in better form to exploit whatever change Keltham has then in his thoughts.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p><em>Are</em> they done here? - Keltham asks himself.&nbsp; He didn't - get a chance to talk about, well, what's actually going to happen to Carissa.&nbsp; Which Keltham apparently needs to treat as an infohazard for probably like at least a month or something.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately Keltham came into this conversation with a clear goal, namely, get his brain into a position to decide whether it was comfortable renting Carissa to the Queen, but with no real idea of how to accomplish that goal.</p>
              <p>...internal interrogation suggests that, on the one hand, their overt interactions have not been very - sexy, doesn't really create any relationship where Keltham rents Carissa to her... oh.&nbsp; In retrospect, maybe <em>that's</em> what the Complicated Flirting was about; it was just that Keltham was much more worried when that happened, about the Queen possibly trying to open her eroLARP route at him, so he shut it down.&nbsp; He was probably not supposed to do that.</p>
              <p>Still, that the Queen flirted (<em>hopefully </em>just pseudo-flirted) at him, at all, is an acknowledgement of Keltham as a sexual-romantic-relationship-having-thing, and that is... possibly enough for whatever weird thing is inside him, Keltham does not understand the rules at all.&nbsp; Well, it's enough <em>provided that</em> the Queen is in fact incredibly hot, which she is.</p>
              <p>But maybe add safety margin?&nbsp; Why do something your brain just barely approves of, when you could do&nbsp;<em>not that.</em></p>
              <p>"I think the dath ilani thing to do in this situation, if it could manage to come up in dath ilan, is that we both tell each other a mildly embarrassing naughty story from our early sexual experiences, in a way meant to acknowledge that the other person's story is sexy and funny, and then we have a relationship that is not just about project management or 'trope' avoidance and my brain is more confident that I can rent Carissa to you."</p>

              <p>- even naive Carissa, who would be experiencing the shock of her life right now, wouldn't be so childish as to let it show on her face.

And it's not like it embeds everything else in a lie; she can tell him afterwards that she would usually have tried to conceal her shock, but didn't, for him.&nbsp;</p>

              <p><em>And also</em> Keltham's worried about Carissa's heart being stolen away from him - not least by her possible delusion that Carissa's own person could possibly be taken away from him, even by the Queen of Cheliax, if Keltham himself had decided to get serious about keeping her - so he now, as indeed the greater part of his compensation for this rental, demands that before he hands over Carissa, the Queen sign such agreements as will duly incentivize her to attempt no such thing and ensure a correct outcome for her if she does.&nbsp; If by untampered truthspell it is proven that Carissa has come to love the Queen and to love her more than she loves Keltham, then Keltham has the right to walk out on all this shit not withstanding other bargains to be signed later, and haul Carissa's chained-up ass away with him, if he chooses.</p>

              <p>Very standard language; it wouldn't do to include anything hard for Abrogail to check, that she'd have to stop to consider, and give away that such compacts are dangerous in front of Keltham.</p>
              <p>What the very standard language <em>says </em>is 'fuck you, stop messing with Asmodeus's pet outsider unless the Church says you can'.&nbsp; She can't even send him to fake etiquette lessons.&nbsp; That said the legal language in which that 'fuck you' is written is very standard, for Hell.<br><br></p>
              <p>But that's pretty much what Abrogail <em>wants,</em> at this point; and you know what, the etiquette thing would maybe not have actually been a good idea, maybe dath ilan also has an idea that there is more than one kind of flirting.</p>

In Baseline, obviously; it would take too long to say in Taldane, and make Keltham very uncomfortable if spoken in Infernal. "The economicmagic under discussion causes the target's mind to be externally influenced and proceed in such fashion as to end up containing thoughts chosen by the causal originator of the economicmagic, these thoughts being not distinguished to introspection from thoughts arising naturally, morever lending these thoughts a quality by which they seem believable and other thoughts will flow into conformance with them, and if done skillfully and by a powerful caster this may be unnoticed even retrospectively,"&nbsp;</p>

There are two things that affect uptake in the general population of a new option: how expensive it is, and how much it requires basic capacity to function in the world. For example, a contraceptive option that requires a person to go in once a week for an appointment, even if the appointment is free, will be effective only for the approximately thirty percent of humans who can do something once a week in order to achieve their long term goals."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"That is correct. A third circle wizard attempting this against a fourth-circle cleric would be detected instantaneously, not even retroactively, in more than half of cases, and my best guess is that they would certainly be detected retroactively in virtually all of the rest; detecting the spell retroactively isn't usually considered hard, unless the caster's skill is unparalleled. The degree of skill necessary to cast the spell undetectably with decent reliability is possessed only by myself, the Queen herself, and perhaps a handful of other casters in Cheliax, all of whom are deployed elsewhere. If you would like, your Carissa can be taught the spell so you can experience having it cast on you by a third-circle caster, even a skilled one."</p>

              <p>"I have not yet come to decisions regarding my having children here.&nbsp; But it has been represented to me by Carissa Sevar that use of the spell 'Alter Self' to male is sufficient to reliably prevent and terminate female pregnancy; I ask you to affirm whether this is so."</p>

              <p>"I know not what standard legal protections exist here, but I would have a contract negotiated between myself, Carissa, Cheliax, and potentially other female parties to become signatory; which says that, if a pregnancy is not past half the standard duration of pregnancy, I have the right to demand that Carissa Sevar, or other parties to be added, cast 'Alter Self' as needed in my opinion to prevent pregnancies that might have come from me."</p>
              <p>"Being a party to this contract may be terminated at will by myself, but by them only after casting 'Alter Self' in a fashion sufficient to prevent any pregnancy that might exist, including latent pregnancies requiring casting after a delay, if those are a thing.&nbsp; Moreover should the other parties simply refuse to cast that spell, the Chelish government will at my demand terminate that pregnancy at once, by such forcible external means as may be standard, up to and including their death and resurrection if there are no simpler means.&nbsp; Nor may a party to this contract leave the reach of Chelish Governance without either my consent or having terminated this contract first, including any castings of 'Alter Self' required to terminate that contract."</p>

              <p>The amount of additional anti-child security he can get through any precautions weirder than that does not seem worth mentioning, given both what they can do with Suggestions and haven't, and that if they were being really clever they could've gotten his precious bodily fluids via the oral sex he already had.&nbsp; You can be more paranoid anywhere, but not all marginal paranoia is marginally useful.</p>

You should be aware, if you are not, that abortion is under most circumstances judged as an Evil act by the goddess who judges such things, Pharasma. She has Her own convictions about whether it is a moral good to a person to bring them into existence; as She created this whole system, you might predict She is broadly in favor, and tends not to find it credible that an abortion is an act for the benefit of the person thereby prevented from being, and also tends to weight it as an act of high consequence. So expect, if you do it a lot, to count as Evil eventually; I don't think that's an unpleasant consequence, but now it's also not unexpected."</p>

It's just incredibly stupid, on principle, to sign something a devil wrote for you, after an amount of review that can plausibly happen now without destroying the mood. The fact she can't see anything wrong with it doesn't mean that much and the fact that there's the clause about no unpleasant surprises means - more, but not enough. However, they don't want to get Keltham the impression that one should treat Lrilatha's contracts as even potentially adversarial.</p>

              <p>Well, what's going to happen to her is already only bounded by Asmodeus's unknowable will and the fact that apparently being tortured enough makes her short-term worse at her job.</p>
              <p>She signs without any visible hesitation, after a respectable amount of time reading it which nonetheless would not be enough to catch a clever trap.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Even in an authoritarian country answering to Hell, it's not easy to prevent rumors, at their tech level and social level. &nbsp;There are too many people, especially in the Imperial Palace, with enough self-considered impunity that they'd whisper a few words among each other, or ask questions of another. &nbsp;Security may stamp out rumors elsewhere, but they've got to be able to exchange whispered rumors among <em>themselves </em>to do their job correctly; or at least, that's what Security wizards sure seem to think. &nbsp;Or Asmodean nobles. &nbsp;Or priests of Asmodeus.&nbsp; They're members of the Inner Ring, and privileged to be the ones who trade rumors if they want, while stamping down hard on all loose talk among the Outers who don't need to think, just be told.</p>
              <p>And Cheliax doesn't think about informational security the same way dath ilan does. &nbsp;They don't have an explicit concept of information theory and probabilistic entanglement and improbable observations narrowing down probable worlds. &nbsp;If a top-secret Civilization project requests two hundred mice, and most other projects don't do that, then the mouse order is also obviously top secret, period, your job isn't to figure out what an adversary could deduce from a piece of unusual information but to deny your adversaries as much information as possible. &nbsp;Even if you're at +3sd they may perhaps be at +5sd, and you won't see all the connections that they'll see.</p>
              <p>Dath ilani children's fiction is replete with cautionary tales of fools who assumed that some fact could not possibly be deduced from the scanty, unreliable information that some slightly less foolish person possessed. &nbsp;Adults, of course, read about more sophisticated and plausible errors than that.</p>
              <p>Not that every dath ilani has the deep information-theoretic security mindset either, to be clear. &nbsp;Any real information-theoretic-security expert of dath ilan - as opposed to some random punk kid on an airplane - would've told Keltham, during the Nidal attack on the villa, that as soon as his life was no longer in immediate danger, he needed to get the shit out of those Obviously Strange Clothes before he went into the villa and anyone project-uncleared got a close or extended look at him. &nbsp;No, <em>not </em>because an ideal agent could use a mere glance at the zipper to deduce precise manufacturing technology not currently known to Golarion. &nbsp;Because the clothes are <em>incredibly abnormal</em> and therefore a <em>highly improbable rare signal</em> and therefore represent a potentially <em>massive update</em> for any adversary who is smarter than you and making unknown deductions; seriously what the shit is Keltham thinking.</p>
              <p>A dath ilani proverb runs, "The most important part of any secret is the meta-secret that the secret exists." &nbsp;(Not literally always true, of course, e.g., consider public-key cryptography.) &nbsp;Cheliax has this concept deeply and instinctively for private interactions, hiding the very existence of secrets from adversaries who'd want to pry them out of you. &nbsp;It doesn't think in quite the same way about most secret government projects, unless there's a specific and obvious reason why a secret also needs to be meta-secret. &nbsp;Tyrannies are not based on a deep respect and worry for what your lessers could do with the information they have, if they were secretly master criminals opposed to you. &nbsp;In an Asmodean tyranny, if you order someone not to think about something or ask any further questions, they don't ask any further questions and make a sincere try not to think about it. &nbsp;That, and not hiding the very existence of the secret itself from anyone, is the first line of defense around secret government projects in Cheliax.</p>
              <p>So if a top-secret Chelish project asks for a budget estimate on two hundred mice, the project manager will think about whether they believe anything top-secret seems obviously deducible from the mouse request; and if there's an obvious way to deduce something genuinely ultra-top-secret, they'll mark the mouse order as being also genuinely ultra-top-secret. &nbsp;Otherwise, it will soon be widely rumored within the Inner Ring - this being something that would make dath ilani informational security experts spit out their drinks - that a top-secret Chelish project ordered two hundred mice, no, nobody's allowed to ask for what. &nbsp;When Abrogail Thrune issues an order, it's put forth under Crown authority so everybody knows how important it is and what happens to them if they fuck up; rather than being issued anonymously with a quantitative priority that isn't any higher than it has to be to get that job done, rounded up to make the exact quantity less revealing.</p>
              <p>Even Hell thinks that it's fine for random contract devils in Dis to know everything their owned souls know; they won't <em>repeat </em>it, right, who cares if their behavior changes in externally observable ways given their knowledge. &nbsp;Hell is playing their informational security game against mortals in Golarion, not gods or dath ilani.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Small stones can start an avalanche, a single added uranium brick can put a pile over criticality.</p>
              <p>While 'Project Pet Outsider' was called 'Project Pet Outsider', even the name of the project obviously-to-a-Chelish-person needed to be secret, since the fact that Cheliax had a pet outsider was explicitly secret.</p>
              <p>A dath ilani would've never renamed it 'Project Lawful'; even Keltham would know better than <em>that</em>. &nbsp;That means the name of the project is entangled with its contents in any way whatsoever! &nbsp;If the name needs to be readable at all, call it Project Artichoke or something else generated true-randomly. &nbsp;And then deploy single-use disposable pseudonyms whenever possible, if the person doesn't need to know <em>the </em>project name to enable a persistent conversational subject, which they usually don't.</p>
              <p>From a Chelish standpoint? &nbsp;You can't figure out what Project Lawful is really doing from hearing that it's called Project Lawful. &nbsp;Why, it probably even gives Cheliax's enemies the wrong idea, if the name leaks somehow! &nbsp;Nobody's going to figure out the existence of Keltham or deduce a prospect of revolutionary military advances from <em>that</em>. &nbsp;So the name 'Project Lawful' is fine to tell to people who are not allowed to know what Project Lawful is about.</p>
              <p>And let's face it, 'Project Lawful' is a really cool name. &nbsp;'Lawful' is a powerful but standard concept that could potentially mean all <em>sorts </em>of specific things. &nbsp;Very evocative, while also very mysterious. &nbsp;Slightly ominous. &nbsp;You could say it's a tease.</p>
              <p>As for whether it is in fact a good idea to assign a top-secret project a really cool name, well, that is something of a separate issue.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>When military teams responded to the Nidal attack, they had been very quickly informed that there was a Lawful-Neutral detecting boy there wearing strange clothing who must be (a) protected at all costs (b) not told or shown that Cheliax is evil; <em>but </em>they were also told that this instruction was never to be repeated to literally anyone or asked about further, and that <em>is </em>an instruction you follow in Cheliax. &nbsp;If the boy in strange clothing then channels positive energy to heal some of the response teams (dath ilani actual security expert: AAAAAAAAAAIIIIEEEE), you're obviously likewise not supposed to ever ask anything about that, or repeat it as gossip.</p>
              <p>But the response team also, for example, found a burned-out archduke's villa in which most of the Security were dead and a handful of pretty female wizard students had mostly survived.</p>
              <p>They saw a literal actual godwar start shortly after this mysterious attack by Nidal.</p>
              <p>They hear rumored, even - and again, here dath ilani informational-security experts spit out their drinks - that the attack had somehow been foretold a half-minute in advance. &nbsp;Why wouldn't that be something you could gossip about, if you were a privileged member of the Inner Ring? &nbsp;You haven't been told it's really seriously absolutely secret; and you haven't been told that because nobody sees how <em>that </em>information leaks the secret of Keltham. &nbsp;There's no particular, known government secret of Cheliax that the prophetic warning reveals; why would it be absolutely classified? &nbsp;Obviously, as a Security, you would not gossip about this with non-Security, unless it was really amusing somehow, because part of being in the Inner Ring is that you get to know and other people don't. &nbsp;But it's not attached onto something classified ultra-secret by a visible secret-leaking line of reasoning, so it's not <em>so </em>secret that even Security isn't allowed to talk about it.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Originally, all of the Inner Ring people among the combat response teams who dared ask at all, were told, at the time, only that the villa was part of a top-secret project into which they couldn't inquire further. &nbsp;And so they inquired no further. &nbsp;On paper it was still called Project Pet Outsider, then, so they obviously couldn't be told the project's name. &nbsp;It was clearly one of those things you're just supposed to not think about; and it was given no mental handle with which to persist it as a concept over time or compare it to other things known.</p>
              <p>Now, however, a Security directive has been issued that, to avoid accidental leakage of info in case the project name gets overheard, the project is to be renamed to 'Project Lawful'.</p>
              <p>And, as a result, it is also now known that the burned-out archduke's villa was being used by a 'Project Lawful', into which you are not to inquire further. &nbsp;This fact itself is not forbidden to be gossiped about within the Inner Ring, to be clear, it's just that you're not allowed to inquire <em>further</em>.</p>
              <p>That double handful of pretty female wizard students who survived inside a small villa library while most of the Security were dead? &nbsp;They are part of 'Project Lawful'. &nbsp;Do not inquire further.</p>
              <p>They somehow got advance warning a half-minute before the attack? &nbsp;Yeah, that's 'Project Lawful'. &nbsp;Don't inquire further.</p>
              <p>The unconscious young girl dressed like all the other supposedly wizard students, who shows to Aura Sight as projecting a Lawful Evil aura strong enough to go with a fourth-circle wizard? &nbsp;Shut up. &nbsp;Don't ask any further questions. &nbsp;She's part of 'Project Lawful'.</p>
              <p>A remarkable number of these apparently young girls who are supposedly unproven second-circle wizards seem to have acquired permanent arcane sight somehow, despite no illusions or shapechanges showing up on them? &nbsp;It's 'Project Lawful', you don't ask why or what's really going on.</p>
              <p>(The young man in strange clothes channeling positive energy?&nbsp; Him you don't talk about <em>period</em>. &nbsp;Not even a whisper to your best friend. &nbsp;You don't ask if he's part of 'Project Lawful' or not; you don't <em>think</em> any more questions.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Another concept that dath ilan has and Cheliax lacks, is the notion of the virality of a discussion topic. &nbsp;Gather five people in a hushed circle; let one say a thing, on subject matter X. &nbsp;While on average, each of the four other people there have &gt;0.25 items remaining to say, in response to the last items said, the discussion continues; if each reply provokes less than 1 total further replies, the discussion dies out.</p>
              <p>Questions you can actually settle by thinking about them do not <em>stay </em>viral. &nbsp;To stay viral they must somehow provoke the appearance of settleability, or some other reward of talking about them, without actually being resolvable.</p>
              <p>Civilization has always been very careful not to allow social media to exist - outside of fiction discussion boards, in which you can't really be objectively&nbsp;<em>wrong</em> about anything too important, and which thus serve as an ongoing dire example to all Civilization of what happens when you implicitly sort ideas by how controversial and hence viral they are.</p>
              <p>(Well, if you dare to engage in Ill-Advised Online Consumerism, you can look at what happens when you do that with other topics too, not just fiction.&nbsp; But dath ilani do not usually do that. &nbsp;Why would they? &nbsp;Obviously it's Ill-Advised for a reason, one that they have no particular motivation to override as an exception. &nbsp;Dath ilani do not grow up inside the mental world of an adversarial cognitive environment where most secrets are being kept for someone else's good and their own harm, and must clearly be uncovered as quickly as possible. &nbsp;They've had a huge number of secrets kept from them as children and then they've grown up and found out that, sure, there were very reasonable reasons for all of that, it <em>was </em>for their own good or the good of Civilization after all.)</p>
              <p>The difference between a conversation topic where each remark provokes &lt;0.8 remarks, and a conversation topic where each remark provokes &gt;1.0 remarks, for an extended duration, is much like the difference between a greater-fire fission reaction where each neutron breaks loose &lt;1 other neutrons and &gt;1 other neutrons. &nbsp;It determines whether the reaction goes critical or not. &nbsp;The effects are not linear.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>People can think up new bright variations on rumors and try whispering those, and some of those variations are more viral and propagate differentially. &nbsp;Given that this is so, why don't all rumors always constantly mutate further and further to create versions of invincible virality?</p>
              <p>And the answer as to why this does not happen routinely among the Inner Ring of Cheliax - leaving aside that they don't have fiction discussion boards per se - is that the Inner Ring is not without its prideful skepticism. &nbsp;To repeat a rumor that cannot possibly be true, the sort of thing only Outers would believe, is to look foolish. &nbsp;The known facts about the archduke's villa and the Nidal attack are not <em>so </em>outrageous that, given their established truth, you ought to consider believing almost anything else you hear about Project Lawful.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the facts from the Nidal attack are not <em>all </em>that is known, now, about Project Lawful.</p>
              <p>Even if you're a Security, a priest, or a noble, even if you think you're part of the Inner Ring, you can't easily get a peek at Carissa Sevar of Project Lawful. &nbsp;Sevar is only rarely visible outside the extremely restricted area of the Imperial Palace where she usually stays, doing who-knows-what, and only particular top Security elites are allowed to read her mind anymore. &nbsp;These are interesting facts, but not skepticism-shattering ones. &nbsp;As for the Lawful Neutral boy in strange clothes, people really <em>aren't </em>talking about him, and the military responders who saw him personally are mostly fighting at the front; the Inner Ring rumor circle doesn't <em>collectively </em>know he exists.</p>
              <p>However.</p>
              <p>Carissa Sevar is not the only part of Project Lawful currently to be found in the Imperial palace in Egorian.</p>
              <p>A certain other person - who, as the only visible sample, may be presumed to be representative of 'Project Lawful girls' in general - has absolutely not been living her life in any way that would deescalate this issue.</p>

              <p>But it's <em>also </em>that she went to Elysium, somehow; and apparently voluntarily came back; and now she's skipping through the temple halls on the way to the torture chamber, to assign her own punishment for heresy; and then getting tortured, which she seems to take pretty well; and in fact starts to sing a song afterwards about how being properly punished can make you feel better, until a priest slaps her to shut her up (which she obeys immediately).</p>
              <p>And if you're worried about the amount of Chaotic or Good aura she radiates, well, nobody except Aspexia Rugatonn is authorized to correct <em>her </em>on matters of faith.</p>

              <p>But it does seem to be true. &nbsp;Credible sources of rumor have repeated the key facts, there are multiple accounts.</p>
              <p>Maybe other things... might also be true?<br><br></p>
              <p>Skepticism breaks, not completely, but far enough to permit mutation and variation to propositions more interesting than usual in an Inner-Ring rumor. &nbsp;The variety and strangeness of the rumors is sufficient that each 1 remark sparks &gt;1 other remarks, people competing to say what <em>they </em>heard; the host population is large enough that new mutated rumors are being originated in the host population faster than individuals get bored with old ones.&nbsp; Replication coefficients go past the critical threshold of 1, not to 1.05, but to 2+.</p>
              <p>A phenomenon is born that appears very rarely in Golarion. &nbsp;Any dath ilani who reads fiction discussion boards would immediately recognize it; the victims here don't even know what's feeding on them. &nbsp;It's gone past rumor, it's gone past avidly repeated rumor, it's gone past wild rumors that you can hear out in one night's drinking and that most people don't actually believe.</p>
              <p>In the heart of Cheliax within the Imperial palace in Egorian, among the members of the Inner Ring of Asmodeus's tyranny, 'Project Lawful' has become a meme.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rumors presently circulating about Project Lawful:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Project Lawful was started because of a direct divine vision from Asmodeus Himself.</p>
                <p>The project manager of Project Lawful committed suicide and had to be severely tortured in Hell into consenting to be Raised before he was put back on the project.</p>
                <p>The top weapons enchanter at the entire Worldwound now works at Project Lawful instead. &nbsp;No she isn't <em>actually </em>third-circle, are you stupid?</p>
                <p>All of the Security wizards on Project Lawful have requested reassignment.</p>
                <p>Otolmens is very concerned about Project Lawful.&nbsp; [Rumored among Otolmens-cleared individuals only, of course.]</p>
                <p>The oldest Project Lawful girl is secretly the real leader of Project Lawful.</p>
                <p>If an event worth celebrating happens to you, one of the girls on Project Lawful will already be standing behind you and will offer you cake. &nbsp;It's good cake and eating it seems to be completely safe as far as anyone can tell. &nbsp;Nobody knows what happens if you refuse to eat it.</p>
                <p>You are not authorized to correct the heresies of Project Lawful.</p>
                <p>One of the Project Lawful girls is secretly Abrogail Thrune, no, you shut up, she totally does that to people.</p>
                <p>Nobody at the Palace knows where the original authorization for Project Lawful came from but everybody is afraid to be the one who takes responsibility for canceling it.</p>
                <p>Abrogail Thrune is negotiating with Project Lawful for the use of its women.</p>
                <p>When Project Lawful moved out of their previous location, they left behind sealed-up skeletons decades old despite having only been operating there for 2 days.</p>
                <p>No the cake girl doesn't give a shit what kind of Forbiddance is up or what kind of wards were on the room. &nbsp;Because Project Lawful that's why.&nbsp; Why yes, that does sound potentially useful if it could be controlled! &nbsp;In unrelated news I hear that Nidal's diamond supply is now in Cheliax for some reason and that their first strike in the war was on Project Lawful, did you think about that question for literally five seconds before opening your mouth?</p>
                <p>Starting a war among the gods isn't the most extreme thing Project Lawful has ever done, just the most extreme thing they couldn't cover up.</p>
                <p>Project Lawful originally started in an incredibly expensive archduke's villa that it took them nearly 2 full days to finish destroying - no, I heard it was mostly gone <em>before </em>the Nidal attack started -</p>
                <p>One Project Lawful girl believes she's one of only 12 people Aspexia Rugatonn really trusts - no seriously, that's what she was thinking to herself, the guy said - no, her thoughts weren't otherwise crazy -</p>
                <p>So apparently every devil in Hell has heard of Carissa Sevar by name. &nbsp;Because of resurrectees who reported to their contract devil, that's why. &nbsp;Yes, in principle that could be true, but <em>why </em>would it be only contract devils who work with Cheliax -</p>
                <p>Even Barons of Hell can't afford to buy the souls of Project Lawful girls in Dis's markets.</p>
                <p>I heard Carissa Sevar was chosen by Asmodeus Himself, no, they didn't say chosen for what exactly, that's classified -</p>
                <p>If Contessa Lrilatha, Gorthoklek, Aspexia Rugatonn, and Abrogail Thrune want to meet Carissa Sevar, and Carissa Sevar wants a nap, guess who gets notified when who else's nap gets finished.</p>
                <p>Project Lawful's manager once managed to piss off Aspexia Rugatonn, Contessa Lrilatha, and Gorthoklek, all in the same day. &nbsp;No shit it didn't turn out well for him. &nbsp;Needed his ass pulled out of the torture room by Asmodeus Himself. &nbsp;That absolutely happened, I was on duty. &nbsp;Yes a direct divine intervention to do that would be very surprising anywhere else. &nbsp;You're new to Project Lawful, aren't you? &nbsp;Project Lawful has never made it through an entire day without a direct divine intervention, the average is usually more like 3, and at some point the gods are literally going to run out of energy to prevent whatever it is they're trying to prevent.</p>
                <p>Are we actually sure that Hell itself knows what is going on with Project Lawful, I mean, has anyone actually summoned a senior devil and checked that they know, is what I'm trying to ask here - all right, that's fair, if Contessa Lrilatha has been spotted on-site then I'm less worried -</p>
                <p>One of Project Lawful's girls can see the future even with prophecy broken, and warned of a coming war with Nidal, but the project manager ignored her until it got to the point where she was yelling about incoming shadows in thirty seconds. &nbsp;Yeah 'oops' doesn't really cover it, Gorthoklek didn't think so either.</p>
                <p>The project manager of Project Lawful has been cursed by Pharasma Herself with all of Her malice.</p>
                <p>One of the girls on Project Lawful who died during the Nidal attack got sorted to Elysium - no, they Raised her successfully - well obviously she consented to be Raised so she could try harder for Lawful Evil next time, just as any faithful Asmodean would do in her place, now would you care to explain why you asked a question with such an obvious answer -</p>
                <p>One of the girls on Project Lawful is constantly calling out to Takaral, who is apparently a Neutral Evil herald of the god Nethys, not that anybody seems to think this could possibly be heretical or something.</p>
                <p>Asmodeus and Abadar are collaborating on Project Lawful.&nbsp; [Because the two gods are known collaborators and it's called 'Project Lawful', not because it leaked via knowledge about Keltham directly.]</p>
                <p>Asmodeus and Erecura are collaborating on Project Lawful.</p>
                <p>Asmodeus and Nethys are collaborating on Project Lawful.</p>
                <p>Asmodeus and Cayden Cailean are collaborating on Project Lawful.</p>
                <p>Oh, well, <em>I</em> heard that Asmodeus and <em>Milani </em>are collaborating on Project Lawful - yes of course I made that up just now, now how about you admit the Cayden Cailean thing is also made up -</p>
                <p>One of the girls in Project Lawful sometimes thinks about herself as belonging to Nethys, not that anybody else in Security seems to consider this could possibly represent a serious concern for multiple reasons.</p>
                <p>Nethys just fucking loves Project Lawful</p>
                <p>one of the girls on Project Lawful has been rigged to EXPLODE</p>
                <p>secret prediction markets in Osirion are giving odds of 1:8 that Project Lawful DESTROYS THE MULTIVERSE</p>
                <p>even the gods are forbidden to intervene in Project Lawful</p>
                <p>The discovery that started up Project Lawful was made by Carissa Sevar while she was serving at the Worldwound, no shit you're not allowed to ask what it is.</p>
                <p>Project Lawful has been instrumental in all of Cheliax's military victories over Nidal.</p>
                <p>One of the Project Lawful girls is secretly the heiress of a County and dresses accordingly.</p>
                <p>The library of Project Lawful looks tiny but apparently has as many books available as a major academy library, if someone asks the Project Lawful girl serving as a librarian to 'go look for them in another room', not that there's a Forbiddance in place or anything.</p>
                <p>The librarian of Project Lawful knows any time one of her books is damaged.</p>
                <p>The librarian of Project Lawful cannot leave her library and sleeps in a room inside it.</p>
                <p>Project Lawful 'wizard' girls have been spotted also casting cleric/oracle spells up to second circle.</p>
                <p>One of the Project Lawful 'girls' used 5 different cantrips in a day - well, I mean, she wasn't obvious about it, two different Securities had to compare notes to figure it out -</p>
                <p>One of the girls on Project Lawful is secretly the cleric of a god other than Asmodeus and nobody on Project Lawful knows who, including the girl herself. &nbsp;Yes, the question of how they know that <em>is </em>then an interesting question, and if we were talking about anything except for Project Lawful you might have a point.</p>
                <p>All of the Project Lawful girls were completely normal before they started working for Project Lawful, yeah, I know, right, it didn't sound very plausible to me either.</p>
                <p>So about the old halfling who detects as Lawful Neutral if you can detect him at all, the most interesting theory I've heard is that he's another form of The Old Man - yeah, I know it's confusing, but one of the heralds of Irori is apparently called that - how would I know why, maybe it's called 'Project Lawful' for a reason -</p>
                <p>A Lawful outsider is being held prisoner inside Project Lawful and interrogated for information.&nbsp; [Not a Keltham info leak except indirectly via the name 'Project Lawful'.]</p>
                <p>Project Lawful is intensively studying the history of Taldor in order to launch a team of operatives into Taldor's past which will convert Taldor to worship of Asmodeus in the present.</p>
                <p>The girls of Project Lawful are collaborating on writing a new kind of romance novel for official publication.</p>
                <p>Cheliax's most-senior retired honeypot instructor was summoned to teach a Project Lawful girl to corrupt paladins more effectively, but after reviewing transcripts the instructor said she was vastly out of her league and went home.</p>
                <p>Project Lawful goes through an awful lot of mice on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>Actually all the Project Lawful girls except Sevar are from the current graduating class at Ostenso wizard academy. &nbsp;No you shut up, I don't care how little sense that makes, my brother is attending that academy. &nbsp;Yeah that's the same thing I was thinking, they probably <em>were </em>normal girls at first, rounded up for an experiment, who got exposed to whatever it is that Project Lawful is studying.</p>
                <p>Project Lawful girls get to decide their own punishments, especially for heresy.</p>
                <p>Can we maybe talk in the first place about <em>why </em>everyone in Project Lawful who isn't Security is apparently a pretty girl or beautiful woman - we're not talking about that, okay, fine, we're not talking about it.</p>
                <p>Project Lawful reports are the only known thing that causes Aspexia Rugatonn to laugh.</p>

              <p>He feels like he's starting to get the hang of this whole 'just doing what <em>I </em>want in the cuddleroom' concept; it's strange and alien and he can still feel unworn sharp edges of his own ?????? reactions jolting him each time he moves, but he is generalizing quickly and mental motions are transitioning from unfamiliar to familiar.</p>
              <p>'Just do what I actually want in the cuddleroom' is not actually that complicated of an idea.&nbsp; And if Carissa can't easily have standard pleasure goals completed for her, then he may as well do what he wants and let her enjoy that without other pressures.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Maybe that's why the eroLARP gave her that exact sex problem in the first place</span> look he just had a really pleasant trope-free interaction, and it is possible there are not in fact any tropes, okay?</p>
              <p>His brain occasionally pokes him and says that he should do something nice for Carissa now, give her something that she wants.&nbsp; Keltham has to remind his brain that Carissa is probably not feeling him to be net in debt to her right now; even if, perhaps, the various things he's finished doing for her, are things that would not have made sense to Keltham as gifts to himself.&nbsp; Also he doesn't have 600gp in hand and also also he doesn't really know how to buy things yet...</p>
              <p>Eh, he'll just say it.</p>
              <p>"I feel warm and fuzzy things towards you and want to do something nice for you," Keltham murmurs, "even though I don't have anything specific in mind.&nbsp; Yes I realize that I've done some fairly nice things for you today already, my brain keeps feeling it anyways."</p>

              <p>"I can't figure out the steps after that.&nbsp; Now, I already realize that this is not going to be how it works in Golarion, but in the non-monogamy mating market of dath ilan, the number of men a woman is simultaneously dating is determined by her ero regeneration rate, how many times per month she wants to have sex, divided by the number of times per month she wants to have sex with any one man.&nbsp; The quality of the men she fucks would be mainly determined by her own desirability on the informal mating market, what qualities she has that are in high demand and low supply, that sort of thing.&nbsp; The main correlation pathway would be if more men wanted to heavily date a low-supply monogamous version of her, than to shallowly date a high-supply nonmonogamous version of her, in which case being nonmonogamous would lower her mating market value, but it's not obvious to me that this is how things work particularly."</p>

              <p>" - do people on dath ilan think of themselves as having a specific number of times per month they want to have sex? - probably not the main point. Uh, on Golarion even if there's not a monogamy agreement it's some evidence you are dissatisfied with your existing relationships if you're shopping around, so it speaks somewhat negatively of your existing partners. Also, on Golarion, women are generally assumed to be - bottlenecked on people who meet their standards - so if they have a lot of sex, they probably have low standards. Though less applicable if one is rumored to be sleeping with the Queen in particular."</p>

But it's - not a hostile move, because it was an offer - "I'll write it," she says coolly, her face neutral. "I'd like it to come in before I return to Keltham."</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She puzzles the rest of it out while she writes. Non-hostile, and in fact very slightly generous; her getting something she wants and doesn't really strictly need, faster. Does he want to be owed a favor - no, she's owed one, for doing the project work earlier, even though she did that for the project not for him - well, obviously they're not doing anything out of generosity for each other, but she was a more useful project collaborator, and so, a minor benefit from it. Why tell her she can write it herself, rather than that he'll write it at the top of the queue for her? He can't be <em>that&nbsp;</em>tired. Maybe something in the genre of - the reward for a job well done is more of a job - you want to do some of my work, you may do it for your benefit - yep, that feels closer to right -</p>

              <p>Contessa Lrilatha, addressed with appropriate courtesy, has a copy of a contract she wrote and to which Sevar has placed her signature in the course of Sevar's work on Project Lawful. Sevar requires it so that she knows to what she has bound herself. If she is expected to have difficulty noticing it, key bits could be underlined.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"I don't know if you got to this in your stack yet," she says, handing it to Maillol, "but I did not intend to make Contessa Lrilatha and Gorthoklek and the Grand High Priestess and Her Imperial Majestry all wait for me, understand my error, and if there's not a punishment code in there already will expect one from the Queen when Keltham hands me over. Other than that, the meeting went well."</p>

              <p>Maillol, when he angered that same group of people, came back worse. There's not actually a way around that conclusion. He is worse. That's not how punishment is supposed to work but evidently it is in the range of mistakes that Cheliax is capable of making. And she can't afford to get worse; she needs to get stronger as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Maybe she can propose to the Queen that she be sent to Hell for however long it's going to need to be. Cheliax has a lot of diamonds, now.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Asmodia feels stronger, now, knowing that good things can ever happen to her, and that someone somewhere might even care.&nbsp; Maybe the 100 years aren't a threat, a week would be a threat.&nbsp; 100 years could just be a message:&nbsp; Go back, you still have something to do, please, I lent you a hand, lend me one too.</p>

              <p>"All right, you piece of shit, let's be clear about a couple of things. First thing, if you have a secret the fact of which also needs to be secret, you can communicate that by Messaging that you need to be alone, or by asking to go to the temple for your debrief, or by saying 'debrief may cover highly classified materials, ask the project head if you're the person to do it', or by exercising literally any initiative whatsoever. I'm not going to rip you apart for that, because I didn't expect any better, but that's how it's done, among people who aren't&nbsp;<em>catastrophically stupid.</em></p>
              <p>Second. If you have a secret the fact of which also need to be secret, you don't just randomly volunteer potentially-relevant information to a large group of strangers for no reason. I am going to guess, wildly, with only my intelligence which is apparently at least double yours, that your devil dying <em>might have had something to do with </em>this very secret secret. Which they are destroying people, in Hell, to protect. If a secret is important enough to destroy devils over, it's&nbsp;<em>probably&nbsp;</em>important enough to say in a&nbsp;<em>whisper</em>, or in a Message, or by&nbsp;<em>passing a note,&nbsp;</em>or by waiting until we got out of the room, because I was very evidently avoiding doing a real debrief until we got out of the room. Instead of any of those things, you opened your stupid fucking mouth, you worthless fucking idiot. I did actually expect you to be slightly less stupid than that because you somehow survived to adulthood, and I&nbsp;<em>repent of my error."</em></p>

              <p>"I'll see you tomorrow, then," she says, and lets the door swing closed, and stares at it for a little while.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>What if we're doing this wrong. Not Hell, Hell isn't doing this wrong, but what if Cheliax in its effort to imitate Hell is, what if they're as far off Asmodeus's vision as Osirion is off Abadar's - because the latter is easy to see from the outside, easy to see how the prejudices of the people who started the project shaped what they were capable of understanding when their god said it.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She walks back towards the temple.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The worst case scenario, unless she offends the Queen, is just that she'll be tortured a lot and that doesn't seem as helpful as it's supposed to be but it also doesn't exactly damage her, it can't even get her lack of feelings about Keltham to stick.</p>

              <p>Asmodia takes some deep breaths.&nbsp; Sevar doesn't talk like a Power of Hell, Asmodia has some idea about that, now that she's met one.&nbsp; She acted more like - she maybe doesn't&nbsp;<em>know</em> why her contract devil would think she's more interesting than anything else in Keltham's project?</p>

              <p>Wait.&nbsp; She's been assigned a personal private room of her very own in the Imperial Palace, even with Pilar right next door, and her own room is obviously large enough for four people if they share the bed.</p>
              <p>And when she came back, the whole room was full of invisible people.&nbsp; And there was <em>a message from the CROWN asking if she had any superpowers, she should probably have focused a bit more on that part, it seems possibly important.</em></p>
              <p>"I have no idea what's going on right now," Asmodia says out loud.&nbsp; "I don't suppose anybody in Security is there and listening and would like to hear my report about a whole lot of people acting very strange?"<br><br></p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>The palace refectory nearest the outer palace temple is quite a lot nicer than the canteen in Project Lawful's old villa site, with a variety of high-quality-food smells on par with the nicest restaurant in Corentyn that her father deigned to take her to once per year, to show her what wealth could buy for her in the way of pride if she ever lived up to her promise.&nbsp; The Continual Lights that illuminate it are warm enough to see the food, but aside from that the decor is definitely a great deal more doompunk than the Corentyn restaurant aspired to be.</p>
              <p>It's mostly priests here up to third-circle, a scattering of nobles, nobody who obviously looks like a Security.</p>
              <p>They don't&nbsp;<em>exactly</em> all hush as she enters like Abrogail Thrune walked into the room, because what actually has to happen is a rapid propagation of people whispering "Carissa Sevar" to people who don't know that, who then stop whatever they're saying and glance in her direction before hurriedly turning back to resume their conversation in quieter tones.</p>
              <p>So there isn't a sudden silence, just a conversation that enters a slowly troughing lull as more and more people glance at her, falling silent, and then start speaking again but quieter.&nbsp; Afterwards there are a lot more faces at tables that happen to be turned in Carissa Sevar's direction coincidentally.&nbsp; And others that are very determinedly looking down at their food and definitely not looking straight at her.</p>
              <p>It sure is one heck of a shirt.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>She burns a Fox's Cunning. She's aware that she's using practically all her spell slots for intelligence enhancement these days, and that she's doing it despite having a headband that makes Fox's Cunning not even as good. She feels fine with this. It feels correct, about a Carissa Sevar capable of pulling this off, that she spends practically all her time tugging her brain into smarter configurations. Maybe some of the habits will stick.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- an incidental solution to a different problem occurs to her. She should have a collar commissioned for herself, as a present to Keltham, that stops her from refusing him. Since, after all, he told her not to. If she presents it to him with enough genuine delight and pride she doesn't think he'll have the nerve to say that actually he wants her to be capable of refusing him and actively choosing not to do it. He seems to know he shouldn't say that to her. ...there's some details to work out but it's a promising general approach.</p>
              <p>These people know who she is, and think she's important and dangerous. That's - well, first of all, that's not ideal, since the project is supposed to be a secret. Probably the fact that she's on a very secret project has spread, somehow - maybe also the fact that the Queen wants her -</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Asmodia said she had a message to Carissa from a devil who was now dead -</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- the devil she tried to sell her soul to knew her name. He had instructions about Carissa Sevar. It wouldn't have been left up to chance whether a summoned devil knew her name, not for something that important. So all the contract devils in Cheliax knew to do something different than their usual, if presented with Carissa Sevar. Maybe that's how people here know about her; they're in regular communication with Hell, and in Hell people know who she is. Almost no one ever comes to Asmodeus's direct attention, the devil told her. Why didn't she take that more seriously? She only half believed it, but even so.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>"My best attempt to filter through the lot and reconstruct something that could have plausibly happened:&nbsp; An ordinary weapons enchanter, stationed at the Worldwound, received a vision from Asmodeus directing them to find some manner of mini-Starstone, which empowers people in several ways.&nbsp; One of those includes bypassing Forbiddances in order to move about cake slices, books, and, in a much more important case, diamonds.&nbsp; You need to give the cake to somebody who'll eat it, or give the book to somebody who'll read it, the ability can't be used that freely.&nbsp; The mini-Starstone bestows powerful auras that may not match true alignments, but are sufficient to change afterlife destinations.&nbsp; It may grant minor cleric spells and magical detection.&nbsp; I do not, presently, buy the claim that seeing the future is included among bestowed powers, since if that were possible at all, the gods would still have it.&nbsp; The initial group of subjects exposed to it were graduating students at Ostenso's wizard academy."</p>
              <p>"The mini-Starstone either fails to empower men who touch it, or turns them into women. &nbsp;It makes people more physically ideal and perfected, over time; which is why you, as the first person to touch it, are now the prettiest of this very noticeably pretty group; and, according to at least one rumor, have become visibly prettier over the last few days."</p>
              <p>"I admit, I'd given less credence to the turns-into-women theory, and probably wouldn't have mentioned it at all, if you weren't wearing an obviously-magical-looking man's shirt that no longer fits you.&nbsp; Not that I'd hold that against you, if you're not exclusive with Abrogail."&nbsp; He smiles in a way that makes it very clear that this is supposed to be a complete joke, or at least, deniable as such.&nbsp; "Oh, and your project manager is a complete fuckup but I don't think anyone has actually deduced what the details were."</p>

              <p>We matter far, far more right now than we will in Hell. If Asmodeus could in destroying all our future potential for Him make us better servants of Him right here and right now, I think He obviously would; in Hell there are millions of souls like us, but here and now we are the&nbsp;<em>only people who can do&nbsp;</em>the most important thing that there is to be done. I am not interested in our long-term spiritual improvement. I have not adopted some kind of heretical belief that punishment is bad for us, in the long run; it is good for us, in the long run, which isn't our priority at all. I have not adopted some kind of heretical belief that it is bad for people to suffer unless they grow from it; if this directive works better paired with some directive to round up a bunch of orphans and torture them, I'll do that, or delegate it if that's allowed because I am&nbsp;<em>kind of busy.&nbsp;</em></p>
              <p>I have a theory, which is that punishment is in the short term particularly bad for the kind of acuity needed to succeed at this project, and I need this project to succeed, so I want everyone to <em>stop torturing my project members&nbsp;</em>without reason to think it will&nbsp;<em>make the project likelier to succeed.</em></p>
              <p>Exception for myself, because I don't think any justification short of Asmodeus personally saying so would protect me now, and I don't want there to be any question of whether I conveniently developed this conviction when facing down something I know I can't handle. Exception for Pilar, because as noted, she likes it. Exception for one random girl at the villa because everything is an eye, and if the girl who still gets punished normally is performing well then we'll go back on this. It's how Evil dath ilan would do it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I don't care about any of you, but I need to be able to use you if I'm going to win. You need to be better than Cheliax knows how to make people. And it needs to happen fast. So we try this."</p>

              <p>He probably should have thought it out earlier.&nbsp; If he wanted to win this, he is far worse off trying to win this fight starting now, than if he'd set up his pieces for this conflict starting after the first moment he'd tried giving Sevar a taste of power.</p>
              <p>Can he take her, if he contests her control of the project right now?&nbsp; It's not at all clear that he can.&nbsp; Yesterday he could've, at the villa where he was running everything and had all the reports.&nbsp; Today he's in the Palace, where he's that pathetic guy who got tortured by Gorthoklek, and Sevar has now met the Queen and her advisers.&nbsp; Paper lines of power count for a lot in a tyranny, but not for everything, not among the Inner Ring.&nbsp; It's not entirely clear that the Security would obey him if Ferrer Maillol ordered Sevar cut down on the spot.&nbsp; This Security isn't one of the older Security from the villa; this Security knows Carissa Sevar only as a Power at least on Ferrer Maillol's level, who always has been such.</p>
              <p>Does he&nbsp;<em>want</em> to take down Sevar, does he want to fight back at all, would he rather just let her have it?&nbsp; Maybe that question should've come first, but if he can't take her, it's a moot one.</p>

              <p>He never asked to be reassigned from the Worldwound to the Imperial Palace in Egorian, where the real games of power were played.&nbsp; Pride never was the part of this he was best at.</p>
              <p>Now all he is, is a fifth-circle priest with two relevant visions from Asmodeus and a job he doesn't understand.&nbsp; And because of those visions, he's not getting away back to the Worldwound.&nbsp; He's stuck with Project Lawful no matter what.</p>
              <p>He doesn't have to be stuck at the top of it, though.&nbsp; Does he want to be the one responsible for Project Lawful when whatever happens, happens, on Day #4?</p>

              </a>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Asmodia is sitting in her peaceful, lovely bedroom in the Imperial palace at Egorian.&nbsp; It is not the gardens of Erecura, and the main thing that makes it different is not that the gardens are nicer-looking or the air is fresher, it is that the gardens are, so far as she can tell,&nbsp;<em>safe,</em> whereas the Imperial palace at Egorian is not safe.&nbsp; It can have the quality of not hurting you right now; it cannot have the quality of being guaranteed to still not be hurting you a few minutes later.</p>
              <p>But she knows where to find safety, for a time, if she needs it.&nbsp; Maybe somebody would be nice to her again 100 years later, maybe not; but what comes after 100 years hardly feels like it would still be real, still be this Asmodia who makes the choice...</p>
              <p>She keeps on reviewing what she knows.&nbsp; Maybe if she knew all that Keltham knew, as well as her own knowledge, she'd be able to figure it out; but she can't.&nbsp; The shadows got her, she was revived in the Imperial Palace, she's next to Pilar so the project is probably still active.</p>
              <p>The gardens were peaceful except for two events.&nbsp; First, the disorienting sensation that, she was informed, not by Erecura this time, had been the sensation of her contract devil being destroyed and her soul being passed to whoever inherited it from him.&nbsp; She'd figured, at the time, that he'd either asked too many questions about the Keltham project, or it was the Carissa Sevar thing.</p>
              <p>Later, she'd been called closer to the center of Erecura's gardens, closer to Erecura Herself in the fullest place of Her power within Her home plane, and the seal on her thoughts had been placed in full.&nbsp; Asmodia can't remember it well; she probably didn't originally experience it well, never mind memory.</p>
              <p>When she'd woken - it apparently being possible to fall unconscious in Hell under <em>sufficiently</em> extreme circumstances - she'd known the rules.&nbsp; How to put thoughts <em>about the existence of the seal,</em> but not the&nbsp;<em>contents of the seal,</em> temporarily outside of the seal and readable.&nbsp; That if she needed to report defiance of the seal, she should go to the most senior outsider under Asmodeus, but <em>not</em> any archdevil or other being reporting directly to Him; and that she was forbidden, by Asmodeus's own Law, to pray to Asmodeus or turn her thoughts too much in His direction, while the seal lasted.</p>
              <p>(No, she is not allowed to ask Aspexia Rugatonn what happened.&nbsp; Not that she would, but it doesn't matter, it's not allowed.)</p>
              <p>And she's been assigned her own room at the Palace, with a bed large enough to sleep four.&nbsp; There was a Crown order on checking her for new or exotic special abilities, which has now been returned with a <em>false </em>answer that she has none.&nbsp; There were way too many invisible people watching her when she came back.&nbsp; Sevar was acting weird, asking weird questions that were almost like she knew the secret but didn't quite, and in other ways acting like she doesn't know what's going on around her any more than Asmodia does.</p>
              <p>Around the only thing in the universe that still remains stable and true is that Abarco is a giant fucking asshole.</p>
              <p>The main thing Asmodia is currently worried about is whether Abarco is right and her devil <em>was</em> destroyed to keep the Secret.&nbsp; She found out that the devil was destroyed, before she found out there was a Secret, so all the explanations she thought up, had nothing to do with what happened to her being Secret.&nbsp; But in retrospect maybe there was always going to be a Secret and she just found out about it later.&nbsp; She shouldn't have mentioned the devil being destroyed.&nbsp; Too late now.&nbsp; Not that she'll ever tell Abarco he was right about anything, and he won't see it in her thoughts, either.</p>
              <p>Asmodia knows what she has to do next, to figure things out, it's all too obvious, she just wanted to keep to her peace for as long as she could before...</p>

              <p>"You'll what, talk at somebody else?&nbsp; You know what, <em>fine,</em> if you absolutely have to blabber to somebody about whatever this is, I suppose it does less damage with me than anyone else."&nbsp; It is his considered opinon that the average Security assigned to safe temple jobs inside the Imperial Palace are noticeably less elite than those assigned to top-secret projects started by divine intervention.&nbsp; Which, in fact, makes sense, but.&nbsp; But.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "So I was the Security in Ferrer Maillol's office when Carissa Sevar walked in on him, and tried to hand him a new policy for the whole Project.&nbsp; I probably shouldn't repeat the exact proposal, but it was <em>six</em> kinds of heretical, and to be clear, she wasn't phrasing it as a suggestion."</p>
              <p>"...you have my attention," he says reluctantly.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "And Maillol protests, obviously, how heretical this is, and Sevar stares him down coldly and says, yes, I know it's heretical, but Asmodeus doesn't give a shit about what condition our souls end up in afterwards, <em>Asmodeus wants us to win.</em>&nbsp; So this is your new project directive."</p>
              <p>"And how'd Maillol take that?"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Looks silently at Sevar for a while, then says he's not taking responsibility for implementing that directive when it's actually hers.&nbsp; He offers to write her a note to Aspexia Rugatonn asking for an urgent conversation about whether Sevar's in charge of Project Lawful or he is.&nbsp; He's happy to serve under her if ordered, but if she doesn't come back with orders saying she's in charge and holding responsibility on the project, he expects Sevar to shut up and obey him in the future."</p>
              <p>"And Sevar?"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Just says 'understood', takes the note from him, and heads off, presumably to talk to the Grand High Priestess."</p>
              <p>"Lovely.&nbsp; I concede that makes a great story, and now you've told it to me and you never tell it to anyone again and it doesn't get added to the rumor firestorm, clear?"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You're not going to die if you admit out loud how badass that was."</p>
              <p>"Yes, <em>fine</em>, it was badass, now, are we <em>done?</em>"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "It was&nbsp;<em>incredibly&nbsp;</em>badass.&nbsp; Not a lot of people would be willing to just completely stare down Carissa Sevar like that."</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>In some sense the entire aim of Project Lawful is to produce Aspexia Rugatonns reliably. She's Asmodean, obviously, can't get more Asmodean, and she's - admittedly Carissa has only heard her speak a few times, but she's heard people speak of her more than that -</p>
              <p>she thinks Aspexia Rugatonn might&nbsp;<em>be&nbsp;</em>Evil dath ilani. Or at least much closer than anyone else. But, obviously, Aspexia Rugatonn is not competent to train Aspexia Rugatonns; she must herself have ended up like that halfway by accident, with felt insights she can't share. More fragments of the Law inside her than inside anyone else but still not rules-bound enough she could teach them. At minimum Aspexia Rugatonn is proof that it's possible to reason like Keltham and reason about how the gods reason and not end up a heretic.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>If Aspexia Rugatonn thinks this specific policy is bad, Carissa will drop it. If Aspexia Rugatonn thinks Carissa is thinking about this all wrong, she'll listen. She doesn't think she's magically the best person around for the project, she knows that many people are better than her, she knows that the Grand High Priestess would be better than her, but the Grand High Priestess doesn't have time. They don't have ten of her, yet.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>I can give you ten.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She isn't sure it's true, but she's sure it'd be a winning argument, if she could, in fact, do it.</p>

              <p>Rugatonn glances around, spots Sevar, and frowns.</p>
              <p>"When were you planning to tell me Carissa Sevar was waiting on me?" she says to her emotionless-appearing secretary.</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I was not informed that I should interrupt -"</p>
              <p>"Whether you interrupt me depends on who I'm with, but if Sevar shows up in my office I at least expect to be notified between appointments."</p>
              <p>Rugatonn turns to Sevar.&nbsp; "Step inside," she says, her voice no less stern and harsh than would be expected of the Grand High Priestess, even when talking to Carissa Sevar.</p>

Even though once she chases the thought down - yes, obviously, Asmodeus isn't omniscient - and she has no idea whether He ever makes&nbsp;<em>mistakes given what he knows </em>but the important thing from the perspective of his servants is that He might not intend the effects of things He does, or might be missing key information -</p>

I don't know whether feelings are like humor in being costly for Our Lord to predict. If Asmodeus chose where or when Keltham landed, and it seems He might have, or have been part of a coalition that decided that, He chose to land Keltham on me, and that must've been because of some feature of me that lent his plans a better chance of success, and it seems like a notable feature of me, that apparently I have feelings - uh, uncertainty, what share of approximately loyal Asmodeans would have this problem -"</p>

              <p>So far, things have worked out well for Cheliax and Asmodeus. They have locked away Asmodeus's competitor; they are in the middle of conquering Nidal, the first meaningful territorial expansion of Asmodean Cheliax. They have all Nidal's diamonds, and will come out of the war richer than they started it, not to mention with most of their casters strengthened. Honestly in the Grand High Priestess's place she'd be tempted to declare they should stop while ahead and kill everyone, except Otolmens instructed that Keltham be contained, and probably there are all kinds of people chomping at the bit to raise him.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>What does Nethys want. Almost unanswerable. He did warn them of Nidal's attack. He likes magic and explosions. There'll be lots of explosions if Keltham teaches Cheliax the weaponry of his world. Maybe Nethys thinks Cheliax is competent to prevent Keltham from destroying the world while allowing him the chance to advance the field by thousands of years. Maybe Nethys is trying to explode Cheliax.</p>
              <p>What do the tropes want. For Keltham to have an interesting sex life, Keltham thinks, for the holes that his Lawful Good society left in him to be filled, for him to realize his shape isn't an error. Maybe Keltham being seduced into Evil is satisfactory to the tropes.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>She should have noticed faster that she was confused by all Asmodeus's unAsmodean instructions. No, that's not quite fair to herself, she noticed it was weird, and drew conclusions - specifically it's how she concluded Asmodeus cared more about their succeeding than their being Asmodean. Backtrace, now. You don't know the reason why. Asmodeus is giving unAsmodean instructions. It's not because He has changed his mind. It's -</p>

              <p>"He and Abadar - or He and Irori - have a deal? Most High?" It has not escaped Carissa that Irori might be involved in the effort to bring a more perfect person to Golarion and that this might be why she was warned not to think herself too like Irori.</p>

              <p>"It may be that our Lord would will these events to continue if He knew of them, it may be that He would have them stop. &nbsp;If it is to my Lord's interests that these intricate events He could not have arranged Himself, continue to occur, then I can only work His will, in that case, by not disturbing them.&nbsp; If I disturb them against His will, He will be realistically unable to tell me how to put them back on track even with a hundred visions and a thousand messages from Hell."</p>
              <p>"If He wants it all shut down, one vision or one communication from Hell would suffice.&nbsp; I would not ordinarily reason so, for <em>every</em> divine intervention is greatly costly to Him; I dare not imagine what other opportunities He has foregone, in this place or in others, for the sake of all this.&nbsp; But here - He is intervening over and over."</p>
              <p>"To make myself easy to control, across both cases of what my Lord could plausibly desire of me, I will allow this to continue unless my Lord tells me to stop, and pray that He is, indeed, paying that much attention."</p>
              <p>"I am not going to refrain from having your feelings corrected at all, especially if it happens in a very predictable and Asmodean way in a particular case.&nbsp; But having this strange entanglement shut down by hammering those feelings out of you - that I will not do.&nbsp; Yet."</p>
              <p>"Now, Sevar, do you think you are able to know all this, without that tempting you to do <em>ridiculously complicated and unpredictable things</em> in order to, as you imagine it, keep the plans of the gods on the track you imagine they were supposed to be on?"</p>

              <p>...probably what the Grand High Priestess means is that many normal human things are ridiculously complicated and unpredictable to Asmodeus so by default she'll be ridiculously complicated and unpredictable if she hasn't had explicit training in how to narrow her actions to the set that don't have that property. Evil dath ilani are probably so good at this.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Without having had that training -</p>
              <p>- what examples does she have of things that are complicated and unpredictable. Humor.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Hives of ridiculous rumormongering.</span> Keltham's experiments being deployed in the world. Sending Alexite Gellius Rutilus Thrune to the Worldwound because it'd be good for him. (She wasn't really going to do that, though, she just had fun thinking of it.) All of those feel too obvious, all of those would also be hard to predict for a human overseeing the project.....</p>
              <p>"What errors will I make, what ways of clouding things for Asmodeus will I fall into, if I am <em>only </em>trying to avoid doing things that'd be surprising or unpredictable to <em>you&nbsp;</em>and failing to take into account the ways in which Asmodeus is in predicting me more limited?"</p>

              <p>(This about Pilar Pineda:&nbsp; She walks through Cheliax a lot less nervously than others.&nbsp; It's fine and proper if she's punished fairly, and even an unfair punishment isn't so terrible.&nbsp; Her loyalty to Lord Asmodeus is, if not absolute, strong enough for her to feel <em>pretty confident</em> in it.&nbsp; If Pilar says anything that <em>sounds</em> questionable, anyone who checks her loyalty will discover that she is thinking all the proper things under Detect Thoughts.&nbsp; It's fine for Pilar to say that she'd rather not learn about Chaotic Good, because any superior who rounds on her for that will find Pilar humbly saying that of course she'd do it if ordered, she'd never dream of not following orders.&nbsp; Scan Pilar as you like with Detect Thoughts, you will find that she is absolutely sincere about that, and not in the way of somebody having to suppress a lot of thoughts either.&nbsp; Cheliax is safe for her, and if she is executed there, she gets to go home.)</p>
