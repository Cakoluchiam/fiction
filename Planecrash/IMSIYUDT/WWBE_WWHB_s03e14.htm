              <p>Nidal's current stocks, combat stores, private stashes, combat reserve stores, emergency reserves, emergency private stashes, final emergency reserves, and all other diamonds in Nidal, don't actually end up massing all that much; a 25,000gp diamond is not a large object by the standards of anything except diamonds.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Policy in Dis is to take reasonably good care of souls awaiting resurrection; it doesn't do to have them return to life desperate to escape Hell for real at any cost. Accordingly the contract devil who owns Asmodia has her copying spell diagrams which can't be typeset, for books of magic. The working conditions are pleasant, for Hell. There is a light that Asmodia can fuel with her blood, and which bathes the workspace with a pleasant golden glow bright enough to copy by without straining one's eyes. The chair is not uncomfortable; that makes scribes slower. There are, of course, no breaks, because petitioners do not need to eat or sleep; if Asmodia is too slow to finish a page she is simply encouraged to drink a potion that'll aid her concentration.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The potions are painful, of course. But Asmodia is, if wholly uninteresting herself, adjacent to something interesting, and so her contract devil told her in a friendly sort of voice the secret to making the potions much less painful. It's that they separate, left on the shelf, into an oily top layer and a magically active bottom layer. It's the top layer that causes the agonizing pain, and if it's dumped out on the ground the potion won't work, but it's all right if it's fed to a different person than the one drinking the rest. (Hell's alchemists worked very diligently to achieve this effect.) Since, at the moment, the contract devil is feeling generous with Asmodia, she may go out and feed the potion-tops to some of the less useful apprentices, or if she's ahead of schedule on her scribing she may go all the way out to the waterfront and feed the first sip of the potion to the conscious, petrified angels that are spaced regularly for decor. You know, as a treat. There are many treats in Hell for the obedient.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>They haven't told her how long it's been.&nbsp; It feels like it's been days.&nbsp; So - probably it's been fewer days.&nbsp; They'll still probably raise her.&nbsp; They'll still probably raise her.</p>
              <p>She's not ahead of schedule on her scribing.&nbsp; Being good at math isn't the same as being fast at writing.&nbsp; She would obviously go feed the potion-tops to the petrified angels if she had time, to show what a good soul she is.</p>
              <p>But Asmodia doesn't have time, so right now she's feeding the potion-top to a less useful apprentice, one very close to her own desk, but not the closest one in case that was some sort of trap for lazy girls.&nbsp; She has no idea who this boy was in life, he looks young but could easily have been here for a hundred years for all she knows, his tongue is burned away and reburned by the line of potions he regularly drinks.&nbsp; What happens to him if he doesn't drink the potions, Asmodia doesn't know.&nbsp; He's chained to his desk and can't stop her, doesn't try to stop her, each time she pours one of the potion-tops into his mouth.&nbsp; Maybe he thinks Asmodia is authorized to do whatever she wants to him, maybe he doesn't realize he could fight back, maybe he isn't in fact allowed to fight back at anything done to him, Asmodia doesn't know.</p>
              <p>Asmodia wouldn't waste any time on pitying him even if there was any pity left in her nature.&nbsp; There's very little doubt that copying spell diagrams for distribution in Cheliax is one of the best jobs in Hell, optimized mostly around maximum production for Cheliax and hence unable to distract the petitioners too much from relatively delicate work.&nbsp; Asmodia's going to be retrained into a contract devil when she dies and that will be much much worse.&nbsp; If she could get this boy's position for herself, when she dies, by throwing him into a lake of fire to burn there forever, there's no doubt she'd do that too.&nbsp; Maybe that's how the boy got his position, by being extra good and doing horrible things to somebody like her.</p>
              <p>She hates him.&nbsp; He's so much better off than she'll be.&nbsp; The passive way he accepts her torments feels like he's mocking her, like he's suppressing a smile knowing how much worse she'll get hers, in time.</p>
              <p>Asmodia asks her contract devil if she's allowed to hurt that boy more for any kind of extra credit, if she has only a little extra time in her schedule but not enough to go feed petrified angels.&nbsp; She doesn't want to waste potions by feeding him extra potion-tops.</p>
              <p>They'll still probably raise her.&nbsp; They'll still probably raise her.</p>

              <p>What happens to Asmodia now?</p>
              <p>Asmodia doesn't ask; it's plaintive, whiny, pathetic, if they want her to know they'll tell her.</p>
              <p>(Unless the rules are different in Erecura's Gardens, but no, no, that's too much to hope for, all hope does is hurt you.)</p>

              <p>Well, either, she's not a useless waste of a person, in some way that Erecura Herself can't foresee, like She said, or, Erecura didn't say, that anything was beyond Her sight, She just asked other questions back, when Asmodia suggested, suggested that, somebody, somehow, somewhere, somewhere in all of everything everywhere, cared about her personally, and did this for her.</p>
              <p>She does start crying, then.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>She's still not sure if it was in fact a good idea to push Keltham on the Second Law and on being more sadistic, she's not sure she'll know for a while if it was the right call or not. She understands the Second Law stuff better now (though she's still hoping she'll get it better still once she sees the transcripts) but she suspects it's not something she can use to do anything, making the universe look more like a sex story will also make Keltham wonder if Cheliax is doing that on purpose, besides how it involves lying and lying remains very dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The whole thing might have gone better without the Queen involving herself but - Carissa's not actually sure. It's not as if there are a lot of agenda-free eighth circle casters who understand the project well enough to get through a conversation with Keltham at all. And the Queen's agenda right now seems to involve convincing Keltham that Carissa is very valuable, which does feel nice. Even though it's probably false. And even though Carissa's pretty sure that anyone else would've assigned a milder punishment for what was admittedly a very insubordinate thought but she's been&nbsp;<em>having her thought transcripts read by the Queen and by high-ranking Church officials for several days now while trying to run a sensitive operation&nbsp;</em>and she actually thinks most people would have had, like, two insubordinate thoughts. Or even three.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"I was born in Corentyn. It's a city on the same coast as Ostenso, but pretty far, five hundred miles or so, right where the Inner Sea opens up into the ocean. My father is a merchant; he works out what cargo will be sent in his ships to other cities, and what they'll trade for there, and he sells foreign goods to merchants in Corentyn and sells Chelish goods far away. I have a half-brother who's going to take over the business from him someday. That's how it's normally done; there's a lot of accumulated expertise no one's written down, so you teach your children. Teach your sons, until pretty recently. My mother is a wizard and when she met my father was doing odd wizard work, a step up from laundry - daily cooling spells for people who don't like the summer heat, Comprehend Languages to translate for merchants, that kind of thing.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>When I was young there was a civil war, and that's when the Queen signed her compact with Hell and formed modern Cheliax, though I don't remember much about it, except that the ships were impressed for moving soldiers around and my father was very annoyed about it, and parts of the city where we didn't live got destroyed. My mother kept me home and tried to teach me magic. After the war the church opened up a school for wizards in Corentyn and my mother got a job as a teacher there and I tested in, and did very well, and when I graduated was encouraged to enlist in the Chelish army and go fight at the Worldwound, because it'd be best for my growth as a wizard and paid very generously and was also necessary to prevent the destruction of the world, which even Evil people care about typically. So I enlisted, and I've served six years now, with a year off in between three-year terms. I planned to stay until I hit fourth circle, because I want to be fourth-circle, and I knew in my heart I might actually stay until I hit <em>fifth</em>, because then you can&nbsp;<em>Teleport,&nbsp;</em>and then I was going to open a magic shop in Corentyn and have kids and be rich."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>So Carissa already knows herself well enough to know she'll want children.&nbsp; Well, she's had longer to figure it out than Keltham.&nbsp; Then again, some people younger than Keltham already seem to know...</p>
              <p>...why is he thinking that he doesn't know if he wants children?&nbsp; He was going to become a billionaire and have&nbsp;<em>lots</em> of children.</p>
              <p>It's pretty obvious on reflection that it's because these children will be real.</p>
              <p>"I was born in Default, the city you're born in when you're not born anywhere particularly interesting, because your parents don't have any particular reason to be anywhere else and so they might as well live where everybody else lives; it's the largest dath ilani city in the world, and the center of Governance is there but not in the center.&nbsp; I got the usual education, but with fewer persistent friendships over time with other children, because my parents moved around a lot.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom is that more persistent friendships are better, in childhood, but my parents basically waved it off because they thought I'd be pretty much all right even if they didn't optimize every single aspect of my childhood as hard as possible.&nbsp; I agree with them about that, but one still gets the impression that all of their friends were horrified.&nbsp; In that dath ilani way where you're privately horrified but conceal the overt signs because, first of all, you don't think that exerting more social pressure will help, and second, they can guess perfectly well that you're horrified.&nbsp; We had a small house-module, maybe something like a tenth or twentieth the size of the villa that got burned down."</p>
              <p>"I'm not sure at exactly what point it became clear to them that I was a little different than the other children, but it must have definitely been apparent at the point where I got - one of the elaborate tests that children get, in dath ilan, which aren't just there to measure us, but also to provide the results for the prediction markets that say what will happen in Civilization's future - anyways, I apparently ran across a lightly injured adult who needed me to get help, and I helped him, but I wanted to be paid for helping.&nbsp; I think that was when my parents decided that they'd made a mistake by assortatively mating with each other to select on the quality of reserving a little more of their life for themselves, and moving a lot if they wanted to do that, even if it meant their child's life was less than perfectly optimal; I was more selfish than either of them, which doesn't always happen, in a heritage-mating setup like that one, but happens sometimes.&nbsp; And dath ilan - when you're different, if it's something they can live with at all, they'll do what they can to make life in Civilization easier for you, despite you being different, because everyone is different, somehow, somewhere, everyone needs exceptions.&nbsp; My parents did the very correct thing, then, and sort of gently tried to offer me opportunities to be more Good, if I wanted to be, but without suggesting that I couldn't still just be Evil if I wanted.&nbsp; They argued with me about it, and tried to argue me into being Good, but only after I started it by trying to argue them into being more Evil."</p>
              <p>"I left home as soon as I could pass the requisite financial maturity and self-governance tests, at thirteen.&nbsp; I set up in a part of Default distant enough that my parents wouldn't visit me often enough to be annoying.&nbsp; I got a very default job - doing a thing you don't have words for, setting up high-precision processes that do things, very mundane high-precision processes though, like some business wanted a tweak made to their high-precision process for selling things," this language <em>really</em> is not going to do 'computer programming' without a&nbsp;<em>long</em> digression, "and put all the money I could into the craziest investments I could find that basically seemed to me like they should work, some went up, some blew up, after five years of that I was ahead of the broader market but very barely.&nbsp; I was hoping to - teach myself, if I kept investing like that, that I'd get good at it."</p>
              <p>"For socialization I had a circle of friends my age writing, a kind of stuff that doesn't exist here, though I did a lot more reading and only enough writing to count, but it meant that when everyone was sitting around in a circle eating whatever people had brought in and talking about everyone's work, that I could keep up and talk about it.&nbsp; I picked that writing circle because their themes were, not quite 'doompunk', not quite, Evil aesthetic, more like supervillainy, but not that really - the point was that they were people who could admire people who were selfish, so long as those people were clearly fictional and they weren't out there being selfish in real life.&nbsp; Which, you know, beats people not even appreciating the aesthetic as an aesthetic.&nbsp; I thought about trying to find a circle of other more selfish people, but always decided against it, because - I didn't want to take it from being my personal identity, to a group identity, it was <em>mine </em>and I didn't actually want to be around five other people doing it slightly differently and have debates about that."</p>
              <p>"Civilization really does try hard to make it possible for people who are different to, just be like that and it's fine and their lives aren't about being different.&nbsp; But a lot of us who are different don't want&nbsp;<em>that</em>, either, we don't just want to pass through it all unnoticed, we feel like we have something to prove, not because Civilization is telling us to prove it, but because we want to prove it anyways.&nbsp; And if what you want is - to be acknowledged for it, to make people admit something, to excel so much that you're above average, Civilization isn't just going to hand that to you.&nbsp; Not everyone can have things that not everyone can have."</p>

              <p>Keltham elects not to say it out loud, for now.</p>
              <p>"They didn't think I was a mistake, a person that they'd wish they'd never made and brought into the world.&nbsp; Nothing like that.&nbsp; Not even close.&nbsp; They felt they'd made their own wrong life choices that had resulted in me existing, that's not the same as saying that I shouldn't exist, that if there's a button you press to get a Keltham, you don't press the button.&nbsp; They just felt that they could've made other choices and gotten some other result instead, and then they would have felt like they'd made their own choices correctly, not that one possible child would be - more valuable to them than the other, if you put them side by side -"</p>
              <p>"Their lives are also theirs, and their regrets belong to them, and they didn't try to make them be something about me or something of mine."</p>
              <p>A sudden lump comes into his throat, as Keltham realizes, having not quite thought of it before:</p>
              <p><em>Everyone who knows me thinks I'm dead.&nbsp; Really dead.</em></p>
              <p>The Keepers have to know.&nbsp; The Keepers ought to tell anyone who's really broken up about it, right, it shouldn't be <em>that </em>much of an infohazard - that you wouldn't even tell the kid's own parents, he's still alive -</p>
              <p><em>The Keepers will tell them that Keltham is still somewhere, probably many different somewheres but some weighing more than others, and that to say anything about the details is far beyond anything the Keepers can do.&nbsp; The Keepers would not be able to foresee specifics like Golarion.</em></p>
              <p>Dath ilan wouldn't put that much effort into cryosuspending every single person no matter what, if they expected all the selfish sadists to end up in worlds with masochists who give them everything they want.</p>
              <p>Maybe hearing the current state of knowledge is actually worse for somebody than thinking their kid is just gone, because if they're just nonexistent, nothing any worse can be happening to them, and more importantly,&nbsp;<em>you can be done thinking about it at some point.</em></p>
              <p>Maybe the Keepers won't tell his parents, or anybody else who knows him, after all.</p>

              <p>Not that this is necessarily a good thing.&nbsp; Though it could be!&nbsp; Keltham doesn't know.&nbsp; It depends on, you know, the entire state of the entire multiverse that he cannot in fact extrapolate in his tiny little mortal-sized brain.</p>
              <p>But he should maybe not talk about this much until he's tried to figure out the ways in which it will be an enormous infohazard, which, again, it clearly will be, somehow.</p>
              <p>"I suspect that - at the scale where whole universes interact, like that - time might not mean as much, or be as synchronized, as it is in Golarion.&nbsp; If you can see dath ilan from here, if that's at all controllable, then it might be just as easy to see dath ilan's past as what I think of as its present.&nbsp; That could be why Asmodeus wasn't trying to grab anyone else right away, if it was expensive, and if He knew that all that was needed was one dath ilani to get things rolling here, and that, in time, Golarion's Civilization would then ascend to where it could finish the job itself."</p>
              <p>"And if you think about it from the perspective of somebody who died - they just need - someone, somewhere, who's powerful enough, who can see them, and cares.&nbsp; Or is willing to trade with something else that cares."</p>
              <p><em>Some trades stretch across time.</em>&nbsp; It's a saying in dath ilan that usually means something rather different, there: just ordinary time in one world, coordinated trades that parents make with children who don't exist yet or haven't matured as economic agents.</p>

              <p>"Well, I don't exactly know how I feel about that. On the one hand it is sort of interesting to have smart people try to think about your life for you, I'm always wishing I was smarter and could do that better. On another, I feel strange about it being someone I haven't met who is reading the project transcripts presumably in their capacity as a Chelish administrator. On another, there's something romantic about people having meetings with you about optimizing me, makes it - less like pretending. On another, you've been here for three days and they've been very stressful and you haven't actually signed up for responsibility for optimizing me! What if you don't want to optimize me? - possibly this is too many opinions to have about a one-sentence summary of a conversation I didn't witness. Sorry."</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- so when I went to the sex shop, there was this sort of pervasive assumption that it was - a little like a costume shop, I don't know how to explain it - that some people like to dress up as the possessions of other people during sex, in the same way as some people like to dress up as dragons during sex, and so they'd sell you the outfit for it. And there's nothing wrong with that. But at the Worldwound people were doing something different, something better suited to me, where - you could give terms up front, obviously, but whatever terms you gave, those were real. They weren't a costume, they weren't a game, the whole thing was obviously in an overarching sense governed by the<em> treaty</em> so no one was risking being maimed or murdered but you wouldn't say 'oh, hmm, I'm bored now'.</p>
              <p>And I was slightly worried that the nobility, being the nobility and sort of aliens at best anyway, had the concept but only the costume-party concept." Yep, that's the problem with the Chelish nobility, that they might be assuming by default that their relationship is one of equals-with-some-pretense, <em>definitely </em>not that everyone who doesn't know exactly what's going on assumes what's going on is that Cheliax gave the alien some welcoming gifts. "And if they're asking you, then - then they're not working off a costume-party concept. Even though it's a sort of silly thing for them to have done and I'm sorry you were inconvenienced."</p>

But my ideal endgame here is that we build a dath ilani city in conquered Nidal and get all the modern conveniences Civilization invents before anyone else and I have so much spellsilver I can do every project that comes to mind as soon as it does and I make us immortal -- though we can still visit Hell sometimes, maybe have a vacation place in Dis -- and sometimes you have a very spirited try at hurting me until I say 'no', and you can't do it."</p>

              <p>"I haven't had anticonformity training, yeah," and appreciate the warning this is something you might do to us because wow it sounds kind of nightmarish in the same way as having the Queen show up to mock you for your thoughts from the transcripts she's reading. Except in the opposite direction so getting both at once is double nightmarish.</p>
              <p>There's genuinely something terrifying there, something that feels like realizing you're not standing over solid ground but on a tightrope over the Abyss.</p>
              <p>Or like noticing you could peel all your skin off. It's true but did you really need to notice it.</p>
              <p>Of course most thoughts are the thoughts you're supposed to have.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><br>How about a change of subject.</p>
              <p>"Well, when it comes to having girls by force, I think there are actually more women with that fetish than men who want to fulfill it, so maybe you can have fun without handwringing about the market value of the experience you're getting for free. Or maybe you can charge, though the specific nature of the fetish does make it seem hard to do that."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>"I am worried that your Alliance is not quite Dark enough, frankly, based on interacting with Isidre and hearing some of her concerns about how much fun the Queen isn't having.&nbsp; Very smart people in dath ilan tend to lean Good.&nbsp; The obvious potential problem with that, if not otherwise averted, is that when you care about a very large number of people, you can end up with very large numbers inside your mental decision processes and especially the parts that do abstract thinking.&nbsp; That can produce thoughts at," edges and vertices of the space of thoughts, "extremes you wouldn't get with a more naturally selfish person where the weights don't go much larger than the weights they put on themselves."</p>
              <p>"Now this, to be clear, is a problem you have to solve with more Law, rather than less Law.&nbsp; If it's a predictable fact that certain ways of thinking are going to make certain mistakes, predict it and then don't make the mistakes.&nbsp; If a Good person ends up thinking it's a good idea to break an oath and go to Abaddon in order to save some larger number of other people from going to Abaddon, they could imaginably be right by their own measures, in which case there's no arguing with the," utility function, "values that entities assign to final outcomes.&nbsp; But I would far more expect to observe that Good people end up systematically mistaken about how much good oathbreaking really does, for example because of the further consequences of people not being able to trust Good people's oaths any more, or anyone's oaths because that person might be secretly Good, or just because Good people usually and systematically end up not saving as many people as they hoped with the sacrifices they make."</p>
              <p>"If you have a lot of very smart Good people, they can train each other out of mistakes like that.&nbsp; I doubt Golarion even bothers to collect <em>statistics</em> on the kind of mistakes that very smart people make."</p>
              <p>"And the other thing about Civilization is that we do not often have to worry about fifteen percent of the population dying.&nbsp; There are not millions of people in fixable-seeming horrible situations, and if there were, you would be working on it with a lot of other people rather than nearly alone.&nbsp; Which probably helps a bunch in practice to keep our smart Good people from ending up at weird extremes without them having to be incredibly Lawful about that."</p>
              <p>"To a dath ilani, Isidre reads strongly as someone with overly large problems to worry about, insufficient Law by dath ilani standards, and an intelligence headband too much more powerful than the headbands of the people around her."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham tries to figure out how he'd feel about telling the Chelish government - well, not to give him Carissa or else, because, like, that is stupid on so many different levels both as decision theory and as a trap that Isidre could be setting for him if she was less than absolutely trustworthy.&nbsp; Please give him Carissa permanently or until he gives her back, to do with as he pleases, and have that be the regulation of Cheliax and not just an arrangement between the two of them, formalizing what Carissa gave him informally, as Carissa herself wants according to your very smart people; and in return Keltham charges Cheliax very very slightly less of their GDP increase, or some such.</p>
              <p>It's not - particularly landing, at this point?</p>
              <p>In a world with Pilars, Keltham can see, somehow - not with the eyes of dath ilan but with the eyes of his own sexuality, that had no place available for it in dath ilan in a way that wasn't anyone's fault - Keltham can see how there could be a submissive!woman gender-subtrope that is like being pursued and dated, but more so. &nbsp;He can imagine how that gender-subtrope of woman might think it was more romantic for a man to desire her so much that he came in and just took her away, paying costs to do that but never asking. &nbsp;The question of how this ends up with the right people matched, and without giant flaming obvious incentive problems if a man likes a woman who doesn't like him back, may perhaps rest on Golarion institutions unknown to him; or it may be a reason why this desire unsatisfiable in reality is fed mainly by Golarion romance novels.</p>
              <p>He can imagine that Carissa wants that - even if he's pretty sure he's not imagining it correctly, true to the real Carissa Sevar, it's enough to explain why <em>a</em> possible person would want that.&nbsp; To be in - metaphorical bed-chains, in her larger social and legal situation, chains that she wears always, as proof that a man wanted her that much.</p>
              <p>Carissa wants it, let's suppose that to be true; does that situation appeal to Keltham himself?</p>
              <p>...not really.&nbsp; The part where Carissa gives herself to him feels deeper and more meaningful, to him, than that choice being taken away from Carissa so that Keltham no longer knows she's still making it. &nbsp;It's a choice that says Keltham is worthy, that he and his sexuality are worth so much to Carissa, that she has judged him and chosen him even though she could have had another, that he is valuable to Carissa in a way he was not so valuable to any woman in dath ilan.</p>
              <p>Is there some way you still get that in full measure, if somebody is with you because they can't escape within Golarion and have opted not to escape to the afterlife?</p>
              <p>Keltham isn't seeing it, for now.&nbsp; Maybe his thoughts are being too crystalline and logical about it; too denying of subtleties and forcing it all into 'well, but then therefore' where people could just opt to not conclude that therefore.&nbsp; Maybe there is a way that Keltham can know Carissa still finds him worthy, even as she lives truly in the world where she has no other choice.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Like the Detect Desires spell, for example.&nbsp; If you have <em>that</em> around for people who can afford it, then it is <em>obviously</em> going to change some things -</p>
              <p>SHIT.</p>
              <p>Does Isidre do <em>that</em> to the people around her.&nbsp; Cast Detect Desires around them, or have it cast by a cleric who reports to her, and maybe not a cleric of Asmodeus either.</p>
              <p>Keltham is trying not to believe it <em>too </em>hard, but his brain just shouted very loudly "YES SHE DOES", because Isidre knows <em>far </em>too much about what various people want.&nbsp; And it is <em>extremely</em> the sort of deontology violation that you'd expect from a Good person with a deficit of Law, an overly powerful intelligence headband, and horrifying problems that are horrifically large.&nbsp; Isidre would reason that the privacy violation was just not really that important, on the scale of twenty million people; and even if her intelligence headband lets her fake some intuitive shadow of the Law of Coordination, she might still argue to herself that knowing more true facts about somebody is not something that ought to cause a breakdown of coordination.&nbsp; Keltham isn't even sure she's wrong, he doesn't have her problems.&nbsp; Call it 75% probability.</p>
              <p>But suppose Carissa is fine with Detect Desires being used on her.&nbsp; Though, maybe that aspect has to be illegible so Carissa doesn't have to admit to herself that she could escape by wanting to be free... well, leave aside the deontology violation of doing it without asking, suppose the thought experiment anyways.&nbsp; Or maybe Carissa says Keltham is entitled to Detect Desires her and truthspell her whenever he wants, because that is part of what it means to give herself to him, and they never have to make mutually legible why or whether Keltham is doing that.</p>
              <p>Consider that Least Convenient Possible World, for the argument against putting Carissa in a situation where the 'absolute-power' (Keltham thinks the Taldane word in Baseline) that Keltham has over her has been formally materialized and made real.&nbsp; The world where Keltham casts Detect Desires every morning, or multiple times per day because Least Convenient Possible World, and the spell always says that Carissa still wants him and judges him worthy and would have him hold 'absolute-power' over her.</p>
              <p>Then what?</p>
              <p>Then Keltham does not really see the added appeal from&nbsp;<em>his</em> perspective; but it is not obviously, or not <em>legibly</em> obviously, something he couldn't do for Carissa to make her happier, at little cost to himself.</p>
              <p>Except for where his mind just screamed that he is tilting further on that dangerous narrow ledge he is standing upon.&nbsp; And also, Isidre warned him not to have that done to Carissa unless <em>he wanted it for himself.</em></p>
              <p>Keltham doing it <em>because Carissa wants it</em> is probably not what Carissa wants either.&nbsp; The Golarion woman's romance novel is about the man who&nbsp;<em>wants you that much in that way</em> and not because he thinks it is something you need to be happy.</p>
              <p>Maybe someday Keltham will come to feel for himself the thing that is the male complement of the gender-subtrope that Carissa has, where he wants for himself to make that 'absolute-power' real, and cast Detect Desires as a guardrail around it, and make it so that if Carissa can't stop wanting him then she can't stop having him either.&nbsp; Maybe someday he'll understand better the grounds he stands on in Golarion, and it will no longer seem like something that would get you kicked out of most cities in dath ilan... well, no, not actually, they're just not going to do that to you in dath ilan, if Carissa is standing there saying 'get the fuck out of our private business, Civilization, I don't need you to protect me'.&nbsp; <em>No victim no crime,</em> as the proverb goes.&nbsp; So it isn't like that.&nbsp; But maybe someday it will stop <em>feeling</em> like that.</p>
              <p>Also Civilization would... what would they even <em>think</em> of a situation where Carissa is going 'Let me out, Civilization, I don't want to be here anymore!', to test the bounds of the chains placed on her and be reassured that they are real, and Detect Desires is showing that Carissa wants <em>desperately </em>for Civilization to laugh maniacally and say 'No you belong to Keltham now!'</p>
              <p>Keltham is sad he will never get to subsidize this question in a voting prediction market.&nbsp; He really wants to know what Civilization would think of it.&nbsp; Well, no, actually he wants to see the enormous flamewar and Very Serious People shouting at each other that would happen if this question really came up.&nbsp; But also he wants to know what Civilization would think of it.</p>
              <p>What does the&nbsp;<em>Kelthamverse</em> think of it?</p>
              <p>...The Kelthamverse is, what, three days old, at this point?&nbsp; The Kelthamverse knows that it is a tiny baby world and wants to refer the question back to Civilization so that it has a good starting point.</p>
              <p>But, mostly, this thoughtsearch has reached quiescence; there is not much expected value of logical information in searching further.&nbsp; Keltham finds no desire within himself, for his own sake, to transform Carissa's free gift to him into a metaphorical chain that she wears always; and for him to do it for her sake is almost surely not what Carissa wants.&nbsp; He will reopen the question when and if he finds within himself that gender-subtrope that is complement to Carissa's.</p>
              <p>And meanwhile, he is not going to say anything to Carissa that sounds like 'Never forget, you've got the right to leave at any time!' because that would be stupid.</p>

              <p>- safer not to lie. Except for how everything is a lie. Carissa has never found lying to be difficult before and these days it's like navigating a dungeon blindfolded.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The fact that Cheliax could mind control Keltham and hasn't is useful evidence of good faith, and also she's already told him that - but also making it clear that Keltham wouldn't notice if sufficiently powerful people did it makes it impossible to preserve an escape avenue where Keltham concludes there's a rot that doesn't extend to the top -&nbsp;</p>

              <p>" - I'm going to start by saying things I'm very sure of and then get to things I'm less sure of," she says. "So, invasive divinations by default&nbsp;<em>feel like something,&nbsp;</em>it's possible to notice them happening to you. Probably, uh, Contessa Lrilatha, or the Queen herself, could cast an invasive divination you couldn't even detect - they could also do mind control that felt like your own choices - but anyone much less powerful than that would be running a reasonably high chance that their targets would notice. Unless there are some powerful secret magic items involved, which there might be.</p>
              <p>When you cast Detect Desires on me I felt it, and I could've attempted to fight you off and probably succeeded. We should .... make sure you know what that feeling is and that you haven't felt it at any time in the last couple of days. Strongly predict you haven't, though. When the priest on duty at the Worldwound first got a revelation from Asmodeus about you, his instructions to me suggested that Asmodeus had very firmly prohibited - a very wide class of things including some we don't even think of as bad behavior - with respect to you."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>In Keltham's mind, a hypothesis is taking shape, a mental model.<br><br></p>
              <p>To a Chelish eavesdropper, it would look like rather a lot of ~~~~.&nbsp; Seeing the idea as a dath ilani sees it, compactly and at a glance, requires a grasp of underlying math.&nbsp; If Keltham wanted to say it to Carissa, he would need to spell out rather a lot of things and also use a whiteboard.</p>
              <p>Keltham's thought revolves around a standard dath ilani concept that Taldane has no word for.&nbsp; 'Intelligence' translated into this word in Baseline; but Keltham is starting to suspect that this reflects a mistake that Carissa and other language donors are making, not a translation accurate <em>in the world.</em>&nbsp; For translation purposes, one must then fix a new term.</p>
              <p>Call this one 'thinkoomph'.<br><br></p>
              <p>'Thinkoomph' is optimization-as-done-by-humans.&nbsp; Its figure-of-merit is correct prediction, choice of action leading to desired outcomes, the power of inner thoughts over the outer world, the power of cognition to apprehend and effectuate reality. &nbsp;Of course, humans do this in a weird idiosyncratic way, and a random possible simple optimizer that was about as powerful as an average dath ilani would not understand and manipulate reality in the same way as an average dath ilani. &nbsp;But if everyone involved is a human, then to speak of 'thinkoomph' as a thing-humans-do whose figure-of-merit is optimization, is not too unsensible a concept.</p>
              <p>Keltham does not need to think about this part right now, he has already chunked the notion of 'thinkoomph' long ago.&nbsp; 'Thinkoomph' is a view into the processes that humans do to produce optimization, viewed from the standpoint where its purpose is optimization, and where the information-theoretic goal of the viewpoint you're taking is to make it easy to describe those usual variations among humans that contribute to the variations in their optimization power.</p>
              <p>Thinkoomph then is not a single number but a structure with some internals.&nbsp; But it happens to be empirically the case that a lot of usefully-discussable smartness-components map not-too-terribly onto a unidimensional line, such that, holding the rest of a mind constant, you get more optimization power as you move up along the line.</p>
              <p>For ease of visualization, then, consider thinkoomph as a seven-dimensional thing, because it happens that there's a useful component analysis like that in dath ilan which gives you seven dimensions.</p>
              <p>Or consider thinkoomph as a machine with seven gears each of varying size, if you don't want to visualize seven-dimensional objects for some weird reason.</p>
              <p>Suppose Detect Intelligence gives you an imperfect partial view of thinkoomph that's made up of, say, (1) speed/clarity of information retrieval plus (2) how much information you can maintain in short-term memory. &nbsp;Detect Wisdom gives you an imperfect partial view of (3) the piece of thinkoomph that's perceptual clarity, which critically has a subpiece (3a) that is clarity and detail and accuracy of introspection.&nbsp; Which is to say - shifting viewpoints from the machinery to the result that machinery produces - that Detect Wisdom imperfectly measures the machinery that grinds to produce reflection.<br><br></p>
              <p>In dath ilan the proverb-poem goes: &nbsp;'Beware lest what you can measure easily becomes all that you measure; beware lest it become all that you optimize; beware lest it become all that you ever think of.'</p>
              <p>The people of Golarion know how to Detect Intelligence and Detect Wisdom, and that's it. &nbsp;So they think there are two components of thinkoomph. &nbsp;They invent two spells to boost the thing-that-Detect-Intelligence-detects and the thing-that-Detect-Wisdom-detects.</p>
              <p>They invent headbands to boost the thing-that-Detect-Intelligence-detects.&nbsp; The amount the headband sells for depends on how large of a shift it produces in that handy spell Detect Intelligence, which, as everyone in Golarion knows, detects Intelligence.&nbsp; If the Detect Intelligence spell says that a headband produces a +3 to Intelligence, it's worth less money than if Detect Intelligence says that the headband produces +4 to intelligence.</p>
              <p>Imagine now that nobody has invented Detect Wisdom yet, just Detect Intelligence.&nbsp; Imagine that somebody with a vision of broader thinkoomph builds a new headband that would, if you could also run Detect Wisdom, show to produce a +3 to Intelligence and a +3 to Wisdom.&nbsp; This headband is probably more expensive to build than the one that produces +4 to Intelligence, probably by a lot, and the Detect Intelligence spell says that it produces an inferior result than the +4 headband.&nbsp; So nobody builds a headband like that, if they don't have Detect Wisdom.</p>
              <p>Does either Intelligence or Wisdom incorporate creativity, outside-the-box solutions, outside-the-box hypotheses?&nbsp; Maybe when Keltham dares to try on an intelligence headband, if he ever so dares, it'll be immediately apparent to him that this headband boosts every part of cognition that Owl's Wisdom didn't boost.&nbsp; But Keltham is guessing that this will prove to not be the case.<br><br></p>
              <p>Consider, then, the world in which Golarion has a Detect Intelligence spell and a Detect Wisdom spell, but these are only 3 out of 7 components of cognition.</p>
              <p>It's not the kids with highest thinkoomph who get tracked to be wizards.&nbsp; It's the kids with the highest Detected Intelligence.</p>
              <p>It is of course famously true that in humans (and describing humans is what the concept of 'thinkoomph' is all about), most things you can measure about thinkoomph's components or outputs will all correlate with each other quite a lot.&nbsp; The kids with Intelligence 14, which Keltham thinks was supposed to be the wizard-tracking threshold, do tend to have Wisdom 12 rather than Wisdom 10.&nbsp; But if you were looking&nbsp;<em>not-at-random</em> at somebody with Intelligence 14, <em>selected on high Intelligence, </em>and asking 'what are the rest of their thinkoomph components like', then the rest are probably more like what their Wisdom score happened to be.</p>
              <p>When you select on kids with high Detected Intelligence, you're not just selecting for kids with high general thinkoomph levels that produce high Intelligence along the way, you're selecting for kids whose Intelligence is unusually high compared to the rest of their thinkoomph.&nbsp; That's why the Wisdom comes out as 12 instead of 14.<br><br></p>
              <p>Dath ilan has heritage-optimized itself over generations&nbsp;<em>in full awareness of how all these measurement and optimization gotchas work.</em>&nbsp; They are doing their best to measure real-world results broadly, and doing genetics and statistics to them.&nbsp; Dath ilan does not want to end up testing some weird projection of thinkoomph that originally started out correlated with thinkoomph, optimizing over this weird projection, and ending up with optimized things that have much more of the weird projected quality than they have thinkoomph.&nbsp; Dath ilan wants&nbsp;<em>actual thinkoomph</em> and is explicitly not pursuing it the stupid way.</p>
              <p>So you've got your kid with Intelligence 18 and Wisdom 14 and they get wizard-tracked and get a +6 intelligence headband or maybe, if they become spectacularly successful, a relic with +6 Intelligence and +4 Wisdom, and if they're incredibly insanely successful, they get 2 or 3 layered Wish spells on top of that.&nbsp; They end up, say, with 27 Intelligence and 21 Wisdom; in dath ilani terms, those subcomponents of thinkoomph would now be at +4.5sd and +1.5sd respectively.</p>
              <p>But their other 4 out of 7 thinkoomph characteristics are still around 14; or in dath ilani terms, if the scales match, -2sd.&nbsp; Golarionites don't know how to easily measure these other components; they don't try to boost them; they don't think about them.</p>
              <p>This sounds a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more like a model consistent with Golarion, than the model where <em>anyone </em>with +6 thinkoomph has literally ever existed here.&nbsp; You don't need training to be a Keeper at +6 thinkoomph, you just are one.<br><br></p>
              <p>Inside Keltham's mind this is all a much shorter and better-chunked thing to think; what he thinks, roughly, is 'Hey maybe they got Goodhart's Cursed on Intelligence and Wisdom metrics'.</p>
              <p>Only Keltham's actual thought is that thinkoomph is the underlying true value; Intelligence and Wisdom are imperfect proxy measures of thinkoomph; optimization over Intelligence and Wisdom will select not just on thinkoomph but on upward divergence of measured Intelligence and Wisdom scores from underlying thinkoomph scores; that this applies both to selecting students for wizard-tracking and for boosting them with Intelligence headbands later; and that this will of course produce people who may detect as +4 Intelligence and +4 Wisdom but who started with something like -2 or -1 underlying general abstracted-correlation-of-thinkoomph-components, and now have something more like +1 final-optimization-power as a result of all that Intelligence and Wisdom boosting.<br><br></p>
              <p>Nobody with +6 thinkoomph has ever walked through this place.&nbsp; They'd shred it around themselves like tissue paper.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>After a bit of silence, relaxing again, mentally leaning into the massage, and yes, very briefly poking some internal curiosity about what exactly it&nbsp;<em>is</em> that is Pilar's obligate fetish precisely speaking, Keltham returns to contemplating more sexual questions.<br><br></p>
              <p>How does he feel about renting Carissa out?</p>
              <p>...mostly he's still getting a WHAT from his brain.<br><br></p>
              <p>Can he evaluate it concretely rather than abstractly?</p>
              <p>Not without having actually met the Queen of Cheliax at all.<br><br></p>
              <p>Okay, but, Keltham does know some people.&nbsp; He even knows some female people, in case this is a polarized gendertrope with respect to the renting individual.&nbsp; How does Keltham feel about renting Carissa to his max-mutual-wordcount coauthor from his fic-circle back in dath ilan, who happens to possess the requisite parts?</p>
              <p>...sad about never writing anything with her again, also, she's&nbsp;<em>proooobably&nbsp;</em>not a sadist like at all(??), also, maybe it actually is not a terribly good idea to think right now about people who believe he's Truly Dead.<br><br></p>
              <p><em>Keltham knows some female people inside a totally different universe that is not that universe.</em>&nbsp; He doesn't know them very well but he can ask himself the concrete question anyways.&nbsp; What if he were to rent Carissa to, say, Tonia Barrero, in repayment of the debt he owes her for an unexpected, un-volunteered-in-advance, at-best-semi-consensual truthspelling?</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>Still file not found, here, he doesn't know Tonia well enough.<br><br></p>
              <p>Keltham knows what to do in this cognitive situation!&nbsp; <em>For purposes of testing this function,</em> keep supplying imaginary values to the Tonia structure until he can complete the function call!&nbsp; If at any point he gets a negative result he can then tweak values to see if there's any value that produces a positive result instead, and then he'll also know what properties he's looking for!</p>
              <p>Let Tonia be a sadist, but, like, a young sadist who's only slightly more experienced there than Keltham, and in no danger of providing Carissa with an unforgettable experience less forgettable than other experiences she's already had, thereby causing Carissa to leave him for Tonia who is the superior sadist...</p>
              <p>...actually Keltham is not sure he really needs this part of the spec, Carissa's current attraction to him is not because Keltham is a supersadist, and therefore it is Perfectly Pseudo-Reasonable that you can't steal Carissa from him by being a better supersadist.&nbsp; Alas, that which is Perfectly Pseudo-Reasonable is not always Perfectly Reasonable.&nbsp; Anyways, fix the current values at favorable ones to see if this function returns 'false' even under quite favorable circumstances.</p>
              <p>Tonia can hurt Carissa slightly more than Keltham, but not threateningly so; she can't give Carissa an orgasm due to Carissa's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">eroLARP character arc posing a</span> sex problem, so Tonia's not threateningly better than him there.&nbsp; And if Tonia was, Keltham could always just tell Carissa she's not allowed... okay something reacted to <em>that</em> inside him, that didn't react to hearing about the magical-item Belt of No Touch.&nbsp; Possibly because in this case there was any reason for it, and that made the scenario more real.</p>
              <p>Or say mostly, in this scenario, Carissa is being rented to Tonia in order to provide Tonia with not-necessarily-reciprocated pleasure just like if Tonia had bought a sex worker in dath ilan.&nbsp; Suppose Carissa doesn't hate it - Keltham's Carissamodel is now complaining that he is not supposed to check this and that offends her dignity of being harder to hurt than that, well, sorry, Carissamodel, that is not what Keltham is optimizing right now.&nbsp; Carissa even manages to have a moderately fun time because Tonia hurts her some and reacts in a way that makes Carissa feel pride in her own sexual skills and it... actually matters to her that Keltham told her to do it?&nbsp; Postulating this part feels hard; Keltham is not himself a Carissa and he is not sure what it is like on the inside to be a Carissa.<br><br></p>
              <p>Keltham thinks he is at least <em>not obviously not-okay</em> with this whole sort of thing?&nbsp; It feels a lot like asking, in an ordinary relationship, how you would feel about your partner going out for a night with somebody else who'd been like 'yeah screw flirting what's your monetary price'.&nbsp; He wouldn't have objected to that back in dath ilan, he wasn't that monogamous with anyone.</p>
              <p>...that these feel like similar questions, probably reflects Keltham <em>failing to get to grips with the actual gendertrope here.&nbsp; </em>Isidre seemed to think this should&nbsp;<em>not</em> feel like the same gendertrope as sex work, even if it had similar gender ratios.</p>
              <p>For one thing, Keltham was&nbsp;<em>aromantic</em> back in dath ilan because he is a&nbsp;<em>romantically obligate sadist,</em> or at least the very first masochist he ran into was the first person he ever started feeling at all like he needed something from her that was about it being <em>from her</em> and didn't funge with things he could possibly get from somewhere else.</p>
              <p>How would Keltham feel about Carissa trading herself to somebody for - one unskilled-labor-week is, like 1.2gp or so?&nbsp; Let's say 2gp, Carissa is hot.</p>
              <p>Parts of Keltham are not happy with this.&nbsp; Because Carissa is <em>his?</em>&nbsp; Because Keltham is insecure about whether that would mean Carissa still liked him more than she likes anybody else?&nbsp; Because Keltham is supposed to give permission first?&nbsp; Keltham doesn't know.</p>
              <p>But if Keltham orders Carissa to do it?&nbsp; For whatever reason?</p>
              <p>- then that's okay.&nbsp; Possibly.&nbsp; At least if all the other call values are set to Imaginary Tonia settings.</p>
              <p><br>And with likely settings on the Queen of Cheliax, rather than favorable settings on Tonia?&nbsp; If, in exchange for an ultimately insignificant symbolic amount of money, and with at least some pressure on the side to deny a trope and perhaps the entire theory of tropism, Carissa is rented to Abrosomething Thrune?&nbsp; Older than Carissa, with the same de facto ability to chain her for real if she really wanted (assuming that Keltham did not object, which he would), probably a much much more experienced sadist than Keltham, with access to far more powerful sex toys that are the equivalent of overpowered vibrators with biofeedback functions and, yes, the ability to make Carissa come.</p>
              <p>...it's not quite an obvious 'no'.&nbsp;&nbsp;It basically depends, Keltham is pretty sure, on whether Keltham is afraid that Carissa can be taken&nbsp;<em>away</em> from him by somebody being a better sadist to her, than he can be for a while yet.&nbsp; If somebody is the more skillful manipulator of masochism, of, what did Isidre call it, submission, can they steal away Carissa's feelings from him?&nbsp; The threat of giving Carissa an orgasm, the threat of also having potential absolute-power over her, seem less real than that.</p>
              <p>Keltham's hindbrain, which may, of course, be entirely factually wrong about everything, intuits that it is basically not possible to steal Carissa by giving her a good-enough orgasm.&nbsp; Hurting her, maybe, understanding the deep keys to her sexuality that Keltham is still struggling with; but not with humanly reasonable amounts of pleasure short of dangerous drugs.<br><br></p>
              <p>And as for the absolute-power threat, in part, it doesn't feel as real because Keltham has not internalized a model of whatever it is that Carissa has inside her.&nbsp; But also, it's impossible for two people to&nbsp;<em>both</em> have potential absolute-power over someone.&nbsp; If they came into conflict, after all, only one of them could get their way.&nbsp; So long as that person would be Keltham, rather than the Queen of Cheliax, everything would be fine, right?&nbsp; It just has to be clear to Carissa that if Keltham and the Queen fought over her, Keltham would be the one to end up with her; if that's true, the keys to her sexuality would be safe.</p>
              <p>...not that Keltham is thinking that he can, like, wield more political power inside Cheliax than its own Nearly Unilateral Chief Executive.&nbsp; But the Queen of Cheliax has to be sensible and consider things like political capital with the Church of Asmodeus, while Keltham can be much less sensible and walk out on Cheliax if the Queen steals his girl from him.&nbsp; It shouldn't be about power alone, Keltham doesn't think; differential <em>willingness to use power</em> should be an acceptable coin to Carissa's sexuality.&nbsp; It controls who would&nbsp;<em>actually</em> end up with her, if it came to that.</p>
              <p>Keltham's not willing, not today, to bargain a probabilistic or absolute walkout on Cheliax, in order to tell the government of Cheliax to hand Carissa over to him in-legal-reality, to say that he considers her a necessary part of his gains-from-trade.</p>
              <p>Telling Cheliax that he considers Carissa a necessary part of his gains-from-trade and he'll walk out if the Queen steals her, either by kidnapping her, <em>or </em>by renting her from Keltham but then giving her an experience that shifts her romantic focus away from Keltham to the Queen?&nbsp; She's Keltham's, the Queen can't have her except temporarily?</p>
              <p>Sure!&nbsp; <em>That,</em> he feels totally willing to do.</p>
              <p><br>Carissa would...&nbsp;<em>probably</em> find that hot?&nbsp; Keltham's Carissamodel confidently finds it <em>very</em> hot if Keltham actually wins at it, but Keltham is not entirely confident in his Carissamodel.</p>
              <p>Well, at least Keltham should definitely win?&nbsp; He can't really see any functional Chief Executive being like 'lol no I'm gonna take Carissa and watch you walk out on Cheliax', and even if the Queen wanted to, her advisors would stop her.&nbsp; She's an overly-Good person in an overly-Good government that has to be stopped by Asmodeus from resorting to outright mind control when it looks like that might be for the greater good of the country.&nbsp; Keltham isn't pure Evil, sure, but he's not <em>that</em> Good, which means he should win this particular contest.</p>
              <p>Of course, that's only if people are running on sanity.&nbsp; If the Queen is running on <em>tropes</em>, she'll try to steal Carissa no matter how bad it would be for Cheliax if she succeeded... but then if those events are running on tropes, it's impossible to win Carissa's true love-sexuality <em>without</em> winning a fight for real power over her,&nbsp;the Queen should ultimately fail to do that after making worrying progress, and then end up kicked up out of Cheliax and/or harem-recruited.</p>
              <p><br>Anyways, he's got enough of an answer that his next step is to ask Isidre to meet again and check his model of how all this works.&nbsp; Or ask Carissa?&nbsp; He kind of wants to ask Isidre first, before he tries to talk with Carissa; Isidre is more willing to be legible, and nothing blows up if he says the wrong thing in front of her.</p>

              <p>- there's not actually much point contemplating what having sex with the Queen of Cheliax would be like, and not just because that definitely counts as flirting with her. It will probably be awful. Carissa is a grown adult and is going to go to Hell someday and can handle awful. It'll probably be - so, being hurt isn't upsetting, being hurt can be fun and even when it's more than she can take, like the cursed bag, it's not upsetting, it's bad but it's a specific kind of bad that's all right. There are things that are actually upsetting, and -&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The idea of ordering her to do it - seems more comfortable now, possibly it has something to do with having heard that she has any coherently imaginable endgame, maybe it's just a shock having had time to sink in and for Keltham to adjust.</p>
              <p>But then his libido might go offline for a while.&nbsp; He shouldn't expend his newly refilled ero reservoir if he needs to have another conversation with Isidre today... it's not clear how urgent this whole thing is, exactly?</p>
              <p>"Carissa," Keltham says out loud, his voice coming out sounding as relaxed as he is, "I'm too relaxed right now to really want to move, so can I ask you to have them return my reply to Isidre that I'm interested in further discussing her second suggested course of action, though I'm not yet on a definite yes.&nbsp; And can I possibly get a yes-no in the next ten minutes about whether or not Isidre wants to meet me again today."</p>
              <p>(It wouldn't occur to Keltham that Isidre might not imagine him to be capable of a quick reconsideration and answer.&nbsp; One hour is a long time to think in dath ilan, and sure it may take&nbsp;<em>longer</em>&nbsp;to reconsider some major life questions, but there's no presumption that you&nbsp;<em>can't</em> do it in an hour.&nbsp; It similarly wouldn't occur to Keltham that he ought not ask a Senior Governance Official for a yes-no answer in ten minutes; somebody like Isidre is surely interrupted often enough, and good enough at task-switching, that she's checking her tiny-task queue every eight minutes, in Isidre's computer-based and network-connected task management system; which will continue to go on existing in Keltham's imagination and his preprogrammed social reflexes unless and until he thinks explicitly about that question for literally half of a second.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>The massage continues to be nice.</p>
              <p>Keltham doesn't... <em>especially</em> feel like massaging Carissa back, apparently, if he is honest with himself about that.&nbsp; He would do it if they were trading pleasures, obviously, but he does not seem to really actually <em>want</em> to give massages.</p>
              <p>He still feels grateful for it, and a need to do something nice for Carissa in return, no matter how much she says he doesn't have to; he wants to anyways.</p>
              <p>Keltham doesn't feel like massaging her back.&nbsp; But he does feel like... buying a massage for her, as soon as he's got any 'gold pieces'?&nbsp; That seems like the blatantly obvious solution -</p>
              <p>The thought of a stranger touching Carissa's naked body does not feel especially pleasant.</p>
              <p>Keltham is not <em>used</em> to his brain working like this, and it's causing his self-model to stumble over itself repeatedly.</p>
              <p>...he could pay one of the other girls to give Carissa a massage&nbsp;<em>from</em> him?</p>
              <p>For that matter, if he doesn't have any gold yet, he could tell Ione to do it after she's recovered.</p>
              <p>Is Keltham allowed to <em>do</em> that, does it count as something Ione offered him?</p>
              <p>Well, Keltham doesn't have any massive anti-legibility issues with Ione, so he can just <em>ask,</em> which will make his life massively simpler.&nbsp; Keltham's guess is that Ione's objection, if she has any, will be that Carissa might ask what got traded to Ione for the massage, and Ione doesn't want to mention the Nethys thing to Carissa.&nbsp; But they could just tell Carissa it's a secret, so that doesn't seem like a problem?</p>
              <p>Seems like a plan.</p>
