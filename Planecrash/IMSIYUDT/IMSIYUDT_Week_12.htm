            <p>It turns out that dath ilan doesn't have exactly the same ideas about kissing.&nbsp; Keltham gets through that by just mirroring what Carissa does, since kisses are anatomically symmetrical.&nbsp; They both survive the experience.</p>

            <p>Carissa invites Keltham to take his first step into sadism by biting her ear, which he does.</p>
            <p>Carissa then mentions the fact that third-circle wizards are tougher than mortals (implying Keltham can potentially bite harder without hurting her).</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Keltham taking off his jacket-shirt is going to look strange, to an inhabitant of Golarion not accustomed to overengineered dath ilani clothing.</p>
              <p>In principle, one spends a lot of time in clothes, and hence should be willing to spend some money on better clothes.</p>
              <p>In practice there is a certain element, in Civilization's clothing choices, of that dath ilani personality trait which always puts a hidden passageway behind at least one bookcase in the house library. &nbsp;Often one that just goes around a short corner and exits from a different bookcase in the same library. &nbsp;The point is, the hidden passageway has to be there, and if you ask why, the people of dath ilan will smile and tell you to shut up.</p>
              <p>Keltham's jacket-shirt assembly includes more technology than just zipper slides. &nbsp;It has been painstakingly designed by a cultural accumulation-over-time of engineers with +4sd intelligence to, among other things: manifest a rainproof hood from no obvious receptable, convert between warmer and colder coverage... and be easy to remove from yourself while you're already cuddling somebody, without having to disentangle yourself. &nbsp;This easy-removal feature makes good use of micro-velcro fine enough to not be obvious from a distance, and arrays of tiny rare-earth magnets which automatically pull bits of fabric back together again in a correct stepwise pattern.</p>
              <p>From an outside perspective, one would see Keltham tear his jacket-shirt off of himself with an audible ripping sound, and end up holding a jacket with no visible damage. &nbsp;If you were watching closely enough, you'd see the jacket split along the seams and then quickly come together again along those same seams. &nbsp;The way this registers from outside is not an accident or any kind of side effect of other design purposes. &nbsp;A mad engineer who would detect in Golarion as INT 26 spent several years figuring out exactly how to do that and make it look cool, subsequently collecting 0.1-unskilled-labor-hour royalties on over 200,000,000 pieces of clothing.</p>

            <p>Keltham:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"But I - don't understand - what you mean by saying that a symmetrical bet isn't Evil. &nbsp;You bet because you expect to win? &nbsp;Maybe some people aren't like that in the cuddleroom, but I sure am - I mean - what version of this practice is asymmetrical, Evil instead of Neutral -"</p>
              <p>"You can't just mean, what, that we pick something with even odds and - bet an hour one way against two minutes the other way? &nbsp;Wouldn't that be less Evil for you, even if it was more Evil for me? &nbsp;Taking things without giving in return, isn't that - I mean, isn't that - a smaller version of Abaddon, basically?"</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Carissa:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"I am here. I am not here because I calculated how much pleasure I could get out of you and how much inconvenience I would be buying it for, and in fact came here without any particular expectation that dath liani sex is pleasurable to Chelish people, though it does seem to be, actually. I am here because I want you, and - part of what it means to want you, in the terms I learned, insofar as it's safe and reasonable and all those other things - is to want to put myself in your power and witness what you do with it, to strip away every conventional arrangement for how we ought to relate to each other, to <em>stop calculating</em> whether it's been long enough or fair enough or reciprocated closely enough, to emerge <em>whatever you choose to make of me</em>. And the difference between us and Abaddon is that I knew what I wanted, and came here to do it, chose this and chose you in pure selfish curiosity about what you'll do with me and where I'll be after that. And if your terms aren't fair, I can walk away, if I'd like, but I can also <em>not </em>walk away, if I'd like. And there's nothing of Abaddon in a bet we both agree to, with our eyes open, for our own reasons, even if it gives you everything and me merely the satisfaction of having that to give you."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Keltham:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"We're taught - that there's always an exchange, one way or another - and that we have to acknowledge whatever that exchange is, to make sure it's a fair one -"</p>
              <p>"If I knew you better, or maybe if just understood Chelish people, I'd already know what you were - expecting from me in this - in whatever we're doing, which is something that I don't even understand, if we're not trading pleasures with each other, which, I mean, some people enjoy the act more than others, it doesn't mean that - what they're doing isn't valuable -"</p>
              <p>"I can tell I'm in the wrong frame for this new thing that we're doing but I was raised among people who weren't Evil enough and I don't understand what the really Evil thing to do here <em>is</em>. &nbsp;Part of me is fascinated by the idea of you giving me things and you being rewarded only by the satisfaction of giving them to me, but wouldn't that make <em>you </em>Good?"</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Carissa:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"It's not resistant to analysis, but you can't do it at <em>all </em>by trying to make sure the other person's getting their duly negotiated share of the value being produced, you will destroy all the value being produced if you try. It runs on - Evil emotions let loose in a context where it is safe to let them loose - on the power that want has, when it's not held in check by all the things that have to hold in in check almost every minute of all of the time, it runs on - from the other end - the ways that it changes you, for the better, to <em>stop looking out for your interests</em> and discover where they fall when you aren't protecting them -"</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Carissa also mentions that sex games can involve giving people orders they can't follow, in order to punish them, and deliberate unfairness.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Boy howdy betsy-booyah is Carissa using some ideas not natural to the conceptual language of dath ilan.</p>
              <p>When Keltham was very young indeed, it was explained to him that if somebody old enough to know better were to deliberately kill somebody, Civilization would send them to the Last Resort (an island landmass that another world might call 'Japan'), and that if Keltham deliberately killed somebody and destroyed their brain, Civilization would just put him into cryonic suspension immediately.</p>
              <p>It was carefully and rigorously emphasized to Keltham, in a distinction whose tremendous importance he would not understand until a few years later, that this was not a <em>threat</em>. &nbsp;It was not a promise of <em>conditional punishment</em>. &nbsp;Civilization was not trying to <em>extort </em>him into not killing people, into doing what Civilization wanted instead of what Keltham wanted, based on a prediction that Keltham would obey if placed into a counterfactual payoff matrix where Civilization would send him to the Last Resort if and only if he killed. &nbsp;It was just that, if Keltham demonstrated a tendency to kill people, the other people in Civilization would have a natural incentive to transport Keltham to the Last Resort, so he wouldn't kill any others of their number; Civilization would have that incentive to exile him regardless of whether Keltham responded to that prospective payoff structure. &nbsp;If Keltham deliberately killed somebody and let their brain-soul perish, Keltham would be immediately put into cryonic suspension, not to further escalate the threat against the more undesired behavior, but because he'd demonstrated a level of danger to which Civilization didn't want to expose the other exiles in the Last Resort.</p>
              <p>Because, of course, if you try to make a threat against somebody, the only reason why you'd do that, is if you believed they'd respond to the threat; that, intuitively, is what the definition of a threat is.</p>
              <p>It's why Iomedae can't just alter herself to be a kind of god who'll release Rovagug unless Hell gets shut down, and threaten Pharasma with that; Pharasma, and indeed all the other gods, are the kinds of entity who will predictably just ignore that, even if that means the multiverse actually gets destroyed. &nbsp;And then, given that, Iomedae doesn't have an incentive to release Rovagug, or to self-modify into the kind of god who will visibly inevitably do that unless placated.</p>
              <p>Gods and dath ilani both know this, and have math for defining it precisely.</p>
              <p>Politically mainstream dath ilani are not libertarians, minarchists, or any other political species that the splintered peoples of Golarion would recognize as having been invented by some luminary or another. &nbsp;Their politics is built around math that Golarion doesn't know, and can't be predicted in detail without that math. &nbsp;To a Golarion mortal resisting government on emotional grounds, "Don't kill people or we'll send you to the continent of exile" and "Pay your taxes or we'll nail you to a cross" sound like threats just the same - maybe one sounds better-intentioned than the other, but they both sound like threats. &nbsp;It's only a dath ilani, or perhaps a summoned outsider forbidden to convey their alien knowledge to mortals, who'll notice the part where Civilization's incentive for following the exile conditional doesn't depend on whether you respond to exile conditionals by refraining from murder, while the crucifixion conditional is there because of how the government expects Golarionites to respond to crucifixion conditionals by paying taxes. &nbsp;There is a crystalline logic to it that is not like yielding to your impulsive angry defiant feelings of not wanting to be told what to do.</p>
              <p>The dath ilani built Governance in a way more thoroughly voluntarist than Golarion could even understand without math, not (only) because those dath ilani thought threats were morally icky, but because they knew that a certain kind of technically defined threat wouldn't be an equilibrium of ideal agents; and it seemed foolish and dangerous to build a Civilization that would <em>stop working</em> if people started behaving <em>more rationally</em>.</p>
              <p>The Taldane word 'punishment' translates into Civilization's conceptual library as a technical concept for a structure that should never appear in reality - not just the punishment itself being kept out of reality; the <em>threat </em>of punishment is something that shouldn't appear in the <em>actual counterfactuals</em>.</p>
              <p>So "giving someone orders that they cannot follow, so you can punish them for failing to follow them" <em>doesn't make any sense even assuming the actualization of a counterfactual threat structure</em>, because <em>punishment </em>is by technical definition something that appears in <em>threats</em>, which, if they're being deployed sanely, are meant to work in a way where the naive agent obeys in actual reality and therefore the threatening agent doesn't have to expend resources on carrying out the punishment in actual reality, so why would you <em>purposefully give somebody orders they can't follow</em>, that doesn't even make sense <em>even in the world where threats work on people</em> -</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>And that's not even getting into the math underlying the dath ilani concepts of 'fairness'! &nbsp;If Alis and Bohob both do an equal amount of labor to gain a previously unclaimed resource worth 10 value-units, and Alis has to propose a division of the resource, and Bohob can either accept that division or say they both get nothing, and Alis proposes that Alis get 6 units and Bohob get 4 units, Bohob should accept this proposal with probability &lt; 5/6 so Alis's expected gain from this unfair policy is less than her gain from proposing the fair division of 5 units apiece. &nbsp;Conversely, if Bohob makes a habit of rejecting proposals less than '6 value-units for Bohob' with probability proportional to how much less Bohob gets than 6, like Bohob thinks the 'fair' division is 6, Alis should ignore this and propose 5, so as not to give Bohob an incentive to go around demanding more than 5 value-units.</p>
              <p>A good negotiation algorithm degrades smoothly in the presence of small differences of conclusion about what's 'fair', in negotiating the division of gains-from-trade, but doesn't give either party an incentive to move away from what that party actually thinks is 'fair'. &nbsp;This, indeed, is what makes the numbers the parties are thinking about be about the subject matter of 'fairness', that they're about a division of gains from trade intended to be symmetrical, as a target of surrounding structures of counterfactual actions that stabilize the 'fair' way of looking things without blowing up completely in the presence of small divergences from it, such that the problem of arriving at negotiated prices is locally incentivized to become the problem of finding a symmetrical Schelling point.</p>
              <p>(You wouldn't think you'd be able to build a civilization without having invented the basic math for things like that - the way that coordination actually works at all in real-world interactions as complicated as figuring out how many apples to trade for an orange. &nbsp;And in fact, having been tossed into Golarion or similar places, one sooner or later observes that people do not in fact successfully build civilizations that are remotely sane or good if they haven't grasped the Law governing basic multiagent structures like that.)</p>

            <p>Carissa continues to attempt to explain that she is trying to give herself to Keltham to do whatever he wants with her.</p>
            <p>Keltham:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Again that sense of standing on a narrow ledge, and not being sure whether Carissa is trying to stabilize him or push him off it.</p>
              <p>"I - you're right that there's a part of me that wants that - wants it a lot - and I keep wanting to say that it's like being offered a, an apple for free, without paying for it, who wouldn't want it, except that I can tell it's more sexual than that," and deeper and darker and maybe dangerous, "but - but how is it okay? &nbsp;How is it all right with you? &nbsp;I keep wanting to check that you're not expecting more equity or the rights to the fasteners in my shirt or - but you sound like you've done this with other sex partners - it seems so, so valuable, to give that to somebody, if you didn't charge for it at all even in non-financial ways then there should be many many more people wanting it then people who'll supply it and I don't understand and yes I know it shouldn't be something I need to figure out to have the sex itself, but it doesn't feel safe to grab something so precious and scarce, whose scarcity has to be rationed somehow, without knowing why I get it, when not everyone gets it, because that reason, whatever it is, is the price*."</p>
              <p>(*) Lit. "factor_that_varies-to_equilibrate-supply-demand" in Baseline, but unfortunately this more technical and general term has just translated right back into 'price' in Taldane.</p>

              <p>Keltham smiles, for he sees the humor in the situation, though he doesn't know if Carissa will find it humorous at all.</p>
              <p>"Well, I just got an interesting answer from my mind when I asked it why I was scared of something I knew I wanted. &nbsp;Apparently, I really don't want to disappoint you by missing some key requirement on my performance that you're not thinking to mention, and then you'll never offer me this again. &nbsp;Apparently, even if three other women here offer it to me, I'm attached to getting it from you, in particular. &nbsp;I have no idea how you'll take that, but it seemed like the sort of thing I ought to let you know."</p>

            <p>Carissa:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Carissa has not encountered that level of being emotionally vulnerable at someone on purpose - presumably it's on purpose? - since she was eight and another child told her that their dad died yesterday, as if they expected sympathy for this. She corrected them, by saying cheerfully, 'you look it. you have a dead dad face' and then, when the kid merely looked confused, 'like, if I were your dad, I would die, of how stupid your face looks'. This got the message across and Carissa does not think the kid even said it to anyone else and got beaten for it, so really, she was doing him a favor.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>....anyway. "So far I have found all your miscommunications very endearing. I think I will enjoy watching you get better at this, even if you are very bad at it, starting out. And - it's doing it more wrong, to want it and - do something else, you aren't actually avoiding doing it wrong that way."</p>

              <p>Well, that was one of the objectives, so, good job on that objective, Carissa. Are such declarations accompanied by snuggles? It seems like maybe they should be. She will stop leaning over him and curl herself in at his side.</p>

It's - it's the same problem they ran into earlier, right, Keltham pulling apparently-magical correlations out of nowhere, because his society shelves entirely different things alongside each other - and not 'actually I really dislike experiencing pleasure', which isn't even true but feels kind of true right now, and not 'oh that was my badly behaved unsexy body double -'</p>

And, uh, it Is physically much safer here but it's also very confusing.

            <p>Keltham:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Keltham hugs Carissa closer to himself. &nbsp;It's an honest reaction, of course, he's not going to start <em>faking </em>things, that would be a sign something had gone dreadfully wrong with an equilibrium; if people acted fake in that way, then Carissa would be expecting the fakery, and if they don't then he's not going to be first to defect, etcetera. &nbsp;Keltham <em>is </em>moved and feeling empathetic suffering, as one would expect, what with Carissa's story being more awful than anything you'd almost ever hear in dath ilan where the news coverage tries to be statistically representative of how often things happen in reality.</p>
              <p>But Keltham is also concealing another thought, one that seems not especially helpful to speak right now, which is about the way that Carissa made sexual sounds despite her low objective arousal. &nbsp;It blatantly rhymes with the Permanent Cheerfulness - he is beginning to suspect it is not dignity - of his students.</p>
              <p>There is, Keltham is beginning to suspect, a kind of damage to the self that non-psychiatrists like himself have never heard of, maybe a kind of damage that approximately doesn't exist in dath ilan; something like an illusion spell, something like the Eagle's Splendor spell, something that unglues seemings from actualities. &nbsp;Keltham suspects, he intuits, that the ungluing isn't just in the outer social world, it's not like a lie told to other people, it reaches deep into people's own selves. &nbsp;It is a form of damage that dath ilani mental training protects against so thoroughly that he was never warned against it as a danger; or maybe it's a socially-inflicted hazard that requires your society to be doing everything wrong simultaneously.</p>
              <p>Fighting endless demons at the Worldwound and that making you tense to the point where you have a hard time getting off during sex even after you leave, well, yes, that's bad or even grimdark; but it's the ordinary kind of grimdark you would see in a movie or novel out of dath ilan. &nbsp;The thing where you make noises like you're fine, that seems very, very, very much worse in ways that Keltham is finding hard to describe. &nbsp;That cannot possibly be something that would not damage a person, nor a thing that an undamaged person would do.</p>
              <p>...he wants to find whatever did this to Carissa and unmake it.</p>
              <p>Ha. &nbsp;Keltham has never felt that way about another person before. &nbsp;It isn't limerence, Keltham doesn't think, it doesn't feel like descriptions he's read of limerence. &nbsp;More like he owns equity in Sevar or, or he doesn't even know.</p>
              <p>He's supposed to set aside sad thoughts like this, but Keltham can feel that he should not do so that quickly. &nbsp;The current running through him now is deep, not lightly to be told to go away and come back later. &nbsp;Still, he can at least not say any such things out loud. &nbsp;If his Carissa is broken and doesn't know it, he shouldn't ask about that or try to explain his hypothesis to her in the middle of sex; under previously decided meta-policy, it should not be said tonight at all.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>"Ha. &nbsp;No, that's not what it means in dath ilan at all. &nbsp;It's the second discipline of speed, which is fourteenth of the twenty-seven virtues, reflecting a shard of the Law of Probability that I'll no doubt end up explaining later but I'm not trying it here without a whiteboard."</p>
              <p>"As a human discipline, 'If you know your destination you are already there' is a self-fulfilling prediction about yourself, that if you can guess what you're going to realize later, you have already realized it now. &nbsp;The idea in this case would be something like, because mental qualities do not have intrinsic simple inertia in the way that physical objects have inertia, there is the possibility that if we had sufficiently mastered the second layer of the virtue of speed, we would be able to visualize in detail what it would be like to have recovered from our mental shocks, and then just be that. &nbsp;For myself, that'd be visualizing where I'll already be in half a minute. &nbsp;For yourself, though this would be admittedly harder, it'd be visualizing what it would be like to have recovered from the Worldwound. &nbsp;Maybe we could just immediately rearrange our minds like that, because mental facts don't have the same kinds of inertia as physical objects, especially if we believe about ourselves that we can move that quickly."</p>
              <p>"I, of course, cannot actually do that, and have to actually take the half a minute. &nbsp;But knowing that I'd be changing faster if I was doing it ideally is something I can stare at mentally and then change faster, because we do have any power at all to change through imagining other ways we could be, even if not perfectly. &nbsp;Another line of that verse goes, 'You can move faster if you're not afraid of speed.'"</p>
              <p>"You seemed to think that the first layer of speed made perfect sense, so I thought I'd go try the second layer on you. &nbsp;Though that may have been a little ambitious now that I'm actually saying out loud what all goes into layer two."</p>

              <p>That's about the best veiled helpful-advice Keltham can offer relative to the obvious possible reason why Carissa might be imitating all the sexual responses of a person who hadn't just gotten back from the Worldwound.</p>

I want to bathe in a flame that hurts me but does not damage me, and emerge perfected. I want to suffer and survive and know things about myself from the surviving. I want to let go of all the things I cling to as I try to keep the world under my control, and learn what happens without them. And I want to watch people transformed by power over me, I want to see what they grow into when I am the raw material they get to use for growing. I - know that I will survive anything, Keltham. I think no one in your world has ever really had that. And since I will survive anything I want to endure lots of things.

                <p>"- so, several things. First, I think you probably actually can't damage me for the rest of my pre-afterlife existence, I recognize I'd be more credible on this front if I didn't apparently have some kind of Worldwound-related trauma but I've been there for six years and I'll be astonished if I have trouble relaxing for a month. And that's, you know, watching my friends eaten by demons in front of me and so on, not getting <em>hurt</em>. Second, I'm worried you're still - reaching too much for a trade frame? Which is maybe my fault, for telling you what I like - I am not trading you 'the right to do whatever you want' for 'hopefully it's a satisfactorily compelling experience for me and if not I'll wish I hadn't made the trade'. I am giving you the right - because I have it, and so I have the right to give it away - to do whatever you'd like."</p>
