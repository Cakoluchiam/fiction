              <p>Aspexia keeps her temper under absolute control. &nbsp;When she gets home for the day - if, indeed, she ever does get home for the day - she's going to order a dozen slaves sent to her, bask in their understandable fears for a while, and then set all of them on fire.</p>
              <p>Why. &nbsp;Why did Otolmens pick <em>him</em>. &nbsp;Why halfling slave #958245?</p>
              <p>...because Broom is a simple predictable mortal, who will do something predictable in the future, if Aspexia had to guess.</p>
              <p>All right. &nbsp;Aspexia will not modify her predictable initial plans unless Asmodeus tells her to. &nbsp;Broom gets a greater invisibility ring and a dagger of assassination; and what Aspexia hopes is exactly the right level of gentle suggestion not to kill random Asmodeans without a reason, and that the reason is supposed to have something to do with his new god and Her purposes, not just Broom's previous grudges...</p>
              <p>Aspexia is glad that she doesn't have to work on this project or live in this villa, but, in fact, she doesn't have to work on this project or live in this villa, so everything is fine.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Awww, Asmodeus's favoritest pet squirrel in all of Golarion has been spooked by Otolmens hanging around!&nbsp; To be fair to His pet squirrel, this is literally among the most reasonable possible reasons for a pet squirrel to become spooked.&nbsp; His pet squirrel is probably not deducing the context about how Otolmens freaks out every time the laws of physics do something She thinks they shouldn't, like throwing out the anomaly-squirrel, and now She is hanging around Golarion being upset about that.</p>
              <p>He sends a faint nonsemantic touch of reassurance.&nbsp; Gods are allowed to do this to their clerics without it being very costly from the intervention budget, so long as they don't do it often enough or reliably enough that it starts to form a signaling code.&nbsp; The part about making Otolmens's new oracle be invisible is weird and unpredicted, but Asmodeus doesn't have time to pay much attention and His pet squirrel probably knows what it's doing. &nbsp;It's not worth an intervention, almost certainly.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Broom has spent a long lifetime looking and sounding, and in some cases thinking, exactly as wise and intelligent as will not get a slave punished under a variety of circumstances.&nbsp; This usually does not call for very much apparent wisdom and intelligence; it is better to let your masters look down on you, when that does not give them a reason to punish you.</p>
              <p>When the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus explains matters to Broom using carefully dumbed-down clauses - about how he's been chosen by the goddess of preventing the world from ending, and he's allowed to kill an Asmodean if he thinks it stops the world ending but shouldn't do so otherwise, except that if he feels a very strong impulse to do <em>anything</em> he should probably do that whether or not it involves killing someone - Broom displays <em>exactly </em>the level of apparent wisdom and intelligence that makes him look like a gruff old halfling sweeper who was in fact able to grasp all that and will do it reliably.&nbsp; He thinks he understands, mistress; some people might make a world-threatening mess that destroys not just Cheliax but all of Golarion, and if it looks like they're going to do that, Broom will clean it up.</p>
              <p>Broom does not plan to do this as a masquerade, or think any worded thoughts about it; it's just a reflex by now.&nbsp; Like so many others in Cheliax, Broom has become not a very distinguishable person from his mask, even to himself.&nbsp; It may not occur to Broom for a while yet that he is now allowed to be wiser or more intelligent than he previously needed to look to his masters.</p>
              <p>This, too, is mortal nature, if you put someone in a position where they are not allowed to look too intelligent or wise, and then take them out of it.&nbsp; There is momentum, but a finite momentum, and it is hard to guess how far that momentum will last.<small></small></p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham has now guessed, and then been shown, what happens when he tries to touch magic, on four different occasions.&nbsp; He's burned his remaining Greater Detect Magic for the day on watching what happens when other people interact with spells above scaffolds, though he can't hold his concentration on Greater Detect Magic while trying his own magical manipulations; and before his spell ran out he also took another look at people catching cantrips.&nbsp; He's not forming solid perceptual generalizations about what does what.</p>
              <p>But he's ever played hyperdimensional arcade games with lots of hidden information and subtlety.</p>
              <p>"I get the impression that Detect Magic is not showing all of the - latent information, hidden facts - about what goes on with magical structures.&nbsp; Like, two magical configurations that looked the same to me, in the illusion you're showing me, could have other different facts about them, not visible in the illusion, not visible in the detection spell, which would change how the spell reacted when I touched it.&nbsp; In particular, I touched it what I thought was the same way twice, and even though it seemed to have reset to the same starting point both times, it reacted pretty differently.&nbsp; Maybe I touched it differently, which could be true, obviously, but going on general behaviors and my intuitive sense of the pattern, I think that - something changed in the hidden background.&nbsp; Does that sound right?"</p>

"Magic&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>deterministic, but the illusion probably isn't conveying enough to fully determine it - if&nbsp;<em>I&nbsp;</em>touch it it'll do what I want every time, for something as simple as a cantrip, but I don't know what additional features of the situation I might be paying attention to that I'm not properly putting in the illusion. For the kind of spell where it won't do what I want every time, I'd be failing to pay attention to its momentum properly, or failing to pay attention to the viscosity it gets from having been recently manipulated, or failing to track an interaction it's having with other nearby magic, but cantrips are so easy that you don't have to account for all of that."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>- they can&nbsp;<em>try&nbsp;</em>but all the known rules of thumb are not quick and all the equations are not <em>known.&nbsp;</em>Principles of Spell Design lays out all of the heuristics you can use but you still usually fail, when designing spells with all of those in mind; it's speculated that gods can see all the hidden properties exactly as clearly as the visible properties and that's why it's not hard for gods to design spells.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>They launch into all the known rules of thumb, usually with the caveat that casting cantrips doesn't actually require this. You can think of one aspect of magic as lagging the visible aspects like so, requiring more energy to move and moving more slowly when it does but also requiring more energy to stop; you can think of another as reacting badly to close contact with itself, and resisting spell structures like such or such, which is why no spells have structures like that; you can think of this other thing as possible to tug into alignment only by sort of jiggling the spell, and you can tell you've got it when you don't get any reverberations when you do&nbsp;<em>this -</em></p>
              <p>And people have, of course, tried hyperdimensional representations that capture all that, but it's&nbsp;<em>hard,&nbsp;</em>and usually less useful to learn than the heuristics if you aren't specifically doing spell design, and none of them have arrived at equations that if solved for let you invent spells, despite having headbands and plenty of motivation. It's understood that the number of ways magic interacts with itself is just very very large, for high circle spells, and it's not reducible complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It is, someone ventures, sort of like the thing Keltham said, about how knowing how objects move doesn't let you catch them in the air.</p>

              </a>
            </div>
            <div class='post-content'><p>Ione Sala has now realized two things.</p>
              <p>First, she knows where there's a copy - several copies, in fact - of 'Principles of Spell Design' in the Ostenso wizard academy's library.</p>
              <p>Second, her oracle's curse allows her to borrow copies of nonmagical books in general circulation, from libraries Ione has already visited and spent time reading inside, if she's been inside the part of the library that has those books. &nbsp;Though it's not teleportation, and she can't use it to write messages back; the books just temporarily disappear from their current libraries, and temporary copies of them get created in her own library.&nbsp; She thinks she can do five books per day at the current power - circle? is it a thing that has circles? - of her oracle's curse, and a borrow lasts for a day unless she expends one use on renewing it.</p>
              <p>Ione has <em>the best curse ever</em>.</p>
              <p>It's tempting to imagine that Nethys did that because she would have wanted it. &nbsp;But that's pathetic; Nethys isn't a Good god who would be thinking like that, even if Good's own propaganda was true. &nbsp;If she has this curse, she's meant to use it for Nethys's benefit; which, so far as Ione can possibly guess, means using it to push Keltham's research forwards.</p>
              <p>This is... also going to make her a lot harder to replace with an imposter that can fool Keltham. &nbsp;But that is not why she is doing this, she is not trying to make Chelish security's life more difficult for her own benefit. &nbsp;Her god has given her an ability which is clearly meant to be used for the benefit of this important Chelish project that Cheliax is spending lots of money on, and she is only going to use it for that. &nbsp;She is completely not going to argue if Cheliax tells her to pretend that a book isn't there or can't be retrieved. &nbsp;In fact, she's going to lie to Keltham and say there's sometimes unpredictable exceptions in which books she can get, specifically so Cheliax can order her not to get something and she'll have an excuse. &nbsp;She is a very good and obedient oracle of Nethys who doesn't want Chelish security to gouge her eye out again, it was very unpleasant, and Ione definitely feels very scared and threatened by that (even if they can't destroy her the way Nethys can). &nbsp;Even Nethys is clearly being somewhat cooperative, since the inability to write any messages back is probably there to reassure Chelish security against information leaking out that way. &nbsp;But it also wouldn't be the best possible service to Nethys to ask Chelish security's permission to reveal this ability; they might say no, and that is clearly not Nethys's will here.</p>
              <p>"Keltham, wait a second," Ione says out loud, "let me write you a note about something."</p>
              <p>She starts to scribble:</p>
              <p><em>I have a secret ability to borrow up to five ordinary books, for a day each unless renewed, if they're in a part of a library that I've been to. &nbsp;Though they're just temporary copies, you can't write things in them permanently, and there are weird exceptions about which books it works on. &nbsp;I think for a project this important, I'll accept if the other girls get suspicious I can do it, or even if you just want me to announce outright that I had a secret like that. &nbsp;Do you want me to get you Principles of Spell Design from the Ostenso academy library?</em></p>
              <p>Is security stopping her?&nbsp; She's really sorry about talking to Keltham first like that, she really is, she didn't do it to make their lives harder, but she doesn't believe that Nethys would want her to offer Chelish security a veto on using her powers to help this important Chelish project <em>at all</em>, which is how Nethys obviously intends them to be used, for Cheliax's benefit, Nethys even made it not involve real teleportation, there could be a pact about this between Nethys and Asmodeus for all they know, Nethys obviously has an interest in Asmodeus succeeding here, and she's very happy to not retrieve particular books in the future if Chelish security says so, and she even lied to Keltham about that like a good obedient Nethys oracle should, without anybody needing to tell her that, please don't hurt her.</p>

              <p>The book has an orderly list of heuristics for telling what the unobservable dimensions of magic are doing. Most of their activities that you have to worry about for low-circle spells are being attracted or repelled by other magic nearby them, or having momentum of their own once tugged on indirectly by tugging on an observable dimension. The strongly recommended way to handle this, as a new wizard, is to practice with small tweaks until you get a feel for it; some people report success trying to imagine and explicitly track what the other dimensions are doing, but most don't, and it becomes practically impossible to do a fully-encompassing version of as you approach higher-circle spells. There are a couple interactions to explicitly track, starting at first circle: they are such-and-such. There are twice as many at second circle.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>"I'm reaching the edge of how much stamina I allocated to spend on this.&nbsp; I think next the plan says I try to cast -"&nbsp; Keltham has to think back on which spells he actually has.&nbsp; Shit, he didn't think to use Eagle's Splendor while interacting with Lrilatha, which was almost certainly what that spell was for... oh well.&nbsp; He can use the two spells one of which is Eagle's Splendor (not as important here) and one of which is Owl's Wisdom, then have security cast Haste on him, then cast Guidance and try to catch it, then try to catch Read Magic - he thinks that was the plan they came up with this morning.&nbsp; "Well, I get some spells cast on me and then try to catch my remaining cantrips.&nbsp; How long do Owl's Wisdom and Haste last, respectively?"</p>

              <p>Everyone seems incredibly entertained. Of course, Carissa herself seems incredibly entertained, while in reality this is occupying a tiny fraction of her attention, and who is she to say, really, that that isn't true of everyone else. Ione, who presumably isn't stupid enough to have told everyone she's a oracle of Nethys, is pretending - what, exactly? Something's up with an invisible assassin halfling who might or might not be watching this, and that sure is some distracting information to have. ...for that matter, maybe every single person here - except Keltham, who couldn't hide it - is having a day as interesting as Carissa's. The devil didn't promise the same offer wasn't being extended to everyone in the room. Here she's been thinking she did something special but maybe this is actually just the default outcome in a situation of as much interest to the gods as this one.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>While Ione and Keltham are flirting she checks for illusions, which would be suggestive of whether anyone has been arrested and is being impersonated already. No one...seems to be? A promising sign, if they've all made it through the first day alive.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Carissa hopes she is not called on for Improv With Innueno and relatedly is not at all in the mood to go on a date tonight. An hour ago she was all delighted about it but now she does not want to beat Keltham at a challenge of sexual cleverness, she wants...what does she want.... to burn in the purified flames of Hell and emerge perfected. Well. That's kind of kinky.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham's very weirdly augmented social-presentation skills are telling him that he's screwing up, faster than they're telling him how to fix it; the problem isn't in his body's execution of the orders his mind is sending, it's that his mind is sending bad orders.&nbsp; Ione may be acting interested for the sake of this skit, but in real life, well, he's not sure because everybody here is sort of hard to read, but in real life, Ione probably wouldn't be interested in the Roguish Gentleman Template he picked up from some of his own previous larping?&nbsp; Even if that Roguish Gentleman Template was being perfectly executed, and even if it didn't come across as a weird dath ilani trope that may not even exist here?&nbsp; Even if he's learning, he's probably learning the wrong thing right now.</p>
              <p>Keltham is used to this feeling.&nbsp; He knows that learning a new art often feels like screwing up, or even meta-screwing-up the process of learning.&nbsp; It doesn't occur to him to be embarrassed about that happening in public, he clearly said that he was going into a learning and practice mode; like, how would people here even know how to <em>read</em> if they'd never learned and practiced anything in the presence of another human being.</p>
              <p>He tries another couple of flirting exchanges, makes no headway on the problem of getting Ione to admit when she's getting off work and leaving her workshop open to robbery, and then gives up.</p>
              <p>"This scenario isn't working for me, can we switch again?" Keltham says, with more calm and confidence than that statement even warranted.</p>

              <p>His first thought is that Keepers would trade out-of-preference sexual favors or <em>do crimes</em> for this spell.</p>
              <p>His second thought is that there's so many thoughts he hasn't been thinking in the last day.</p>
              <p>His third thought is that this is a mind-affecting drug, one making him think that he can think better and promising epiphanies, even if the rest of his mental processing isn't degraded.&nbsp; There are protocols trained for being hit by mind-affecting drugs like that, which you're supposed to follow even if it seems like you have better ideas for things to do while you're on the mind-affecting drug.</p>
              <p>It takes an additional effort and self-surety for Keltham to override that very trained and solemnly advised protocol, even temporarily.&nbsp; But he can <em>see,</em> even more clearly than he could at other times, that it would be stupid to follow standard protocol and run out of this room immediately.&nbsp; He knows he's more awake right now, and it doesn't matter how many people think they're becoming super awake as they fall asleep and into madness, he can tell the difference.</p>
              <p>He still needs to cast his spells and then leave this room of untrusted others.&nbsp; These are rules that derive strength from their unconditionality; there is some real sense in which even an extremely well-justified exception to them is breaking or bending a piece of the Algorithm that would work better for other people the more unconditional it is, and those people should remember the same thing about that Algorithm.&nbsp; That's even leaving aside where part of his reason for violating these hard-and-fast rules about behaving under conditions of mental oddity, is that he died in a plane crash and has been in a magical world for the last day, which isn't the sort of epistemic state that - he's wasting time.</p>

              <p>While that's going on, you don't let people who aren't Keeper-trained and Keeper-oathbound talk to you. &nbsp;You especially don't talk to people you don't trust an awful lot. &nbsp;You double-especially don't talk to whoever talked you into using the drug or maybe subtly guided you down a path that ended with that decision. &nbsp;There are known drugs that seem to have an effect of permanently relaxing your priors about whatever somebody says to you while you're on drugs, which in dath ilani terms is something like a date rape of the soul. &nbsp;Keltham has had drugs that mimic the more innocuous effects that go along with those, and Owl's Wisdom is absolutely nothing like them, but still.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham ducks in and starts writing.&nbsp; Translation spells are a thing, and he's not sure how that interacts with cracking the kiddie's substitution cipher he has memorized, for writing non-readable notes to himself in RPGs and so on.&nbsp; Instead he's going to write down some cultural references from his homeworld, and hope that there's no version of a cultural translation spell that reads through <em>those;</em> Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra, as it were.</p>
              <p>He doesn't have time to think through very much, the first priority is just to write out all the things he hasn't been thinking, notes to himself to hang the thoughts upon, to be followed up later.</p>
              <p><em>Blue and orange,</em> is the first thing he scratches out.&nbsp; There's a constant drumbeat of hints that the people around him operate on a very alien and possibly inhumane morality, and he's been saying things to himself like Carissa was probably making a joke he failed to get, when she talked about tossing the rats into a pit to cannibalize each other and <em>selling tickets to that like people would pay to see it.</em>&nbsp; There's a whole history of little pings like that and his brain pushing back at the dissonance with 'Maybe it was a joke I didn't get?' and he can <em>see </em>that, now, while he's got Owl's Wisdom running.</p>
              <p><em>Subverted True-man Show, </em>he writes out next.&nbsp; The girls all wore permanently cheerful expressions during class, Meritxell and Ione and everyone else didn't read as any less genuine to him than their usual selves read while they were acting out routines, like they were all experienced actresses, like they were all <em>already</em> acting.&nbsp; But they're <em>not </em>running a well-designed full Immersive Reality TV Show trope on him either.&nbsp; If they were really such good actresses, with smart people and smart scripts behind them, they wouldn't be giving that <em>away</em> by wearing permanently cheerful smiles during class, or by not <em>acting awkward</em> when they were called on to act out new weird scenarios.&nbsp; They're not trying to prevent him from realizing that they all have and are using acting abilities like he got from his Charisma boost, which, if they were actually constructing a false reality around him, would be the first thing they'd try to avoid him knowing.</p>
              <p>(Keltham also makes a note in the back of his mind, not for the first time today, that if they don't get adequate Governance support and don't end up with more urgent priorities, inventing ballpoint pens sure seems like it should be a moneymaker.)</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>The next part is - hard for him to write.&nbsp; It feels like it's a betrayal of the person that he'll be, when this temporary boost wears off, to think about this part, to write down the anchor for it.&nbsp; But he can't unsee it, and it's already too late.</p>
              <p>There is a commonly held wisdom, in dath ilan, about the way a human mind is put together, that it is a thing made of little subtle tensions and balances and internal compromises.&nbsp; The human mind being the limited thing that it is, these balances form around your current level of ability to see into yourself and see the implications of what you already know - or not see them, as the case may be.&nbsp; The reason why not everybody runs off to learn all they can from Keepers, the reason why not everyone asks a Keeper to tell them all the answers about themselves, is that this would bring parts of themselves into conflict that were previously living in a more agreeable truce of ignorance.&nbsp; You might not survive as yourself, if you could see yourself.</p>
              <p>Those who say "That which can be destroyed by the truth should be" may continue to walk the Path from there.&nbsp; But not uncommonly, even somebody who sets out along that Path, turns back at some point, and well short of becoming a Keeper.&nbsp; It's not a trivial price, higher for some than others, and there is varying willingness to pay.&nbsp; A lot of the reason why Keepers exist as what they are, is that the people who have large comparative advantages there - in how little they'll be hurt by knowing themselves, or how much they really internally want to keep going anyways - are conceived of by larger society as being paid to throw themselves on that grenade, so others don't have to.&nbsp; And if, to some Keepers, it doesn't feel like much of a grenade at all, they understand that their case is not typical, and are grateful for winning the comparative-advantage lottery.</p>
              <p>Going up by two local standard deviations, in whatever it is that Owl's Wisdom enhances, is something that the current structures of Keltham's personality were never built to withstand.&nbsp; He knows, from up here, because he couldn't&nbsp;<em>stop</em> himself from glancing in that direction, that in dath ilan he would never have had his 144 children.&nbsp; He would have tried to be special and failed and been sad and then maybe gotten an ordinary +0.8sd job and either paid for a child out of that or decided he was too strange and unhappy to have one.</p>
              <p>It's not considered necessary for somebody Keltham's age to go and pay a Keeper to tell them exactly what the probabilities are, about something like that. &nbsp;It's not so much that people are encouraged to lie to themselves, reality forbid, but that people are told it's okay for them not to shove themselves as hard as possible down the Pathway that will dissolve the mistakes their current personality is built out of. &nbsp;That's what <em>Keepers </em>are for. &nbsp;They do it so that not everybody else has to. &nbsp;There are grownups around in Civilization, who can and will speak up if the people less mature are about to make some terrible mistake out of their blindness.&nbsp; So you do not need to rush ahead to be a Keeper if you'd rather be a little less coherent, a little more yourself and your mistakes and your contradictions, a little more human, for a time.</p>
              <p>But it's too late now, for Keltham to go back, because also in the common wisdom is that once you see what it is you weren't letting yourself see - once you <em>know</em> which mistakes your personality is founded upon - or even if you're trying hard not to know it, to the point where it's becoming a big internal battle - well, at that point, you're supposed to give it up.&nbsp; It means that, well, sorry, you <em>are</em> that smart now, like it or not, you <em>are</em> that wise, you&nbsp;<em>did</em> grow up that much whether or not you wished to stay a child for longer; it's time to move on.</p>
              <p>And the part where he was going to fail at his life's goals, in dath ilan, isn't even the important thing that he can't help but see now, about himself; realize now, at this level of wisdom.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>There was a question asked once of some bright children, among whom Keltham was numbered; in a class where he had seemed to be among the oldest and worst performers; a class assembled of kids who were faster than Keltham.</p>
              <p>And young Keltham had, by that time, already seen through some of the Lies Told To Children; he was past his experience with finding that lightly injured adult on his way home.&nbsp; He had learned that children are sometimes put into contrived situations meant to teach them things.&nbsp; Keltham was suspicious already, before the key moment; he had already guessed that he was meant to learn, in this class, something about what it feels like to be surrounded by others faster and more knowledgeable and even younger than you are.</p>
              <p>But in this guess, Keltham proved to be wrong; he was not the one there who was to learn a lesson, that day.</p>
              <p>The class was on self-integrity, and relatedly morals; a class taught directly by a Watcher-over-Children, not entrusted to older children at all.</p>
              <p>And the Watcher told the class a parable about an adult, coming across a child who'd somehow bypassed the various safeguards around a wilderness area, and fallen into a muddy pond, and seemed to be showing signs of drowning (for they'd already been told, then, what drowning looked like).&nbsp; The water, in this parable, didn't look like it would be over their own adult heads.&nbsp; But - in the parable - they'd just bought some incredibly-expensive clothing, costing dozens of their own labor-hours, and less resilient than usual, that would be ruined by the muddy water.</p>
              <p>And the Watcher asked the class if they thought it was right to save the child, at the cost of ruining their clothing.</p>
              <p>Everyone in there moved their hand to the 'yes' position, of course.&nbsp; Except Keltham, who by this point had already decided quite clearly who he was, and who simply closed his hand into a fist, otherwise saying neither 'yes' nor 'no' to the question, defying it entirely.</p>
              <p>The Watcher asked him to explain, and Keltham said that it seemed to him that it was okay for an adult to take an extra quarter-minute to strip off all their super-expensive clothing and <em>then</em> jump in to save the child.</p>
              <p>The Watcher invited the other children to argue with Keltham about that, which they did, though Keltham's first defense, that his utility function was what it was, had not been a friendly one, or inviting of further argument.&nbsp; But they did eventually convince Keltham that, especially if you weren't sure you could call in other help or get attention or successfully drag the child's body towards help, if that child actually did drown - meaning the child's <em>true</em> life was at stake - then it would make sense to jump in right away, <em>not </em>take the extra risk of waiting another quarter-minute to strip off your clothes, and bill the child's parents' insurance for the cost.&nbsp; Or at least, that was where Keltham shifted his position, in the face of that argumentative pressure.</p>
              <p>Some kids, at that point, questioned the Watcher about this actually being a pretty good point, and why <em>wouldn't </em>anyone just bill the child's parents' insurance.</p>
              <p>To which the Watcher asked them to consider hypothetically the case where insurance refused to pay out in cases like that, because it would be too easy for people to set up 'accidents' letting them bill insurances - not that this precaution had proven to be necessary in real life, of course.&nbsp; But the Watcher asked them to consider the Least Convenient Possible World where insurance companies, and even parents, did need to reason like that; because there'd proven to be too many master criminals setting up 'children at risk of true death from drowning' accidents that they could apparently avert and claim bounties on.</p>
              <p>Well, said Keltham, in that case, he was going right back to taking another fifteen seconds to strip off his super-expensive clothes, if the child didn't look like it was <em>literally right about</em> to drown.&nbsp; And if society didn't like that, it was society's job to solve that thing with the master criminals.&nbsp; Though he'd <em>maybe</em> modify that if they were in a possible-true-death situation, because a true life is worth a huge number of labor-hours, and that part did feel like some bit of decision theory would say that everyone would be wealthier if everyone would sacrifice small amounts of wealth to save huge amounts of somebody else's wealth, if that happened unpredictably to people, and if society was also that incompetent at setting up proper reimbursements.&nbsp; Though if it was like that in real life instead of the Least Convenient Possible World, it would mean that Civilization was terrible at coordination and it was time to overthrow Governance and start over.</p>
              <p>This time the smarter kids did not succeed in pushing Keltham away from his position, and after a few more minutes the Watcher called a halt to it, and told the assembled children that they had been brought here today to learn an important lesson from Keltham about self-integrity.</p>
              <p>Keltham is being coherent, said the Watcher.</p>
              <p>Keltham's decision is a valid one, given his own utility function (said the Watcher); you were wrong to try to talk him into thinking that he was making an objective error.</p>
              <p>It's easy for you to say you'd save the child (said the Watcher) when you're not really there, when you don't actually have to make the sacrifice of what you spent so many hours laboring to obtain, and would you all please note how none of you even considered about whether or not to spend a quarter-minute stripping off your clothes, or whether to try to bill the child's parents' insurance.&nbsp; Because you were too busy showing off how Moral you were, and how willing to make Sacrifices.&nbsp; Maybe you would decide not to do it, if the fifteen seconds were too costly; and then, any time you spent thinking about it, would also have been costly; and in that sense it might make more sense given your own utility functions (unlike Keltham's) to rush ahead without taking the time to think, let alone the time to strip off your expensive fragile clothes.&nbsp; But labor does have value, along with a child's life; and it is not incoherent or stupid for Keltham to weigh that too, especially given his own utility function - so said the Watcher.</p>
              <p>Keltham did have enough dignity, by that point in his life, not to rub it in or say 'told you so' to the other children, as this would have distracted them from the process of updating.</p>
              <p>The Watcher spoke on, then, about how most people have selfish and unselfish parts - not selfish and unselfish <em>components in their utility function,</em> but parts of themselves in some less Law-aspiring way than that.&nbsp; Something with a utility function, if it values an apple 1% more than an orange, if offered a million apple-or-orange choices, will choose a million apples and zero oranges.&nbsp; The division within most people into selfish and unselfish components is not like that, you cannot feed it all with unselfish choices whatever the ratio.&nbsp; Not unless you are a Keeper, maybe, who has made yourself sharper and more coherent; or maybe not even then, who knows?&nbsp; For (it was said in another place) it is hazardous to non-Keepers to know too much about exactly how Keepers think.</p>
              <p>It is dangerous to believe, said the Watcher, that you get extra virtue points the more that you let your altruistic part hammer down the selfish part.&nbsp; If you were older, said the Watcher, if you were more able to dissect thoughts into their parts and catalogue their effects, you would have noticed at once how this whole parable of the drowning child, was set to crush down the selfish part of you, to make it look like you would be invalid and shameful and harmful-to-others if the selfish part of you won, because, you're meant to think, people don't <em>need</em> expensive clothing - although somebody who's spent a lot on expensive clothing clearly has some use for it or some part of themselves that desires it quite strongly.</p>
              <p>It is a parable calculated to set at odds two pieces of yourself (said the Watcher), and your flaw is not that you made the wrong choice between the two pieces, it was that you hammered one of those pieces down.&nbsp; Even though with a bit more thought, you could have at least <em>seen</em> the options for being that piece of yourself too, and not too expensively.</p>
              <p>And much more importantly (said the Watcher), you failed to understand and notice a kind of outside assault on your internal integrity, you did not notice how this parable was setting up two pieces of yourself at odds, so that you could not be both at once, and arranging for one of them to hammer down the other in a way that would leave it feeling small and injured and unable to speak in its own defense.</p>
              <p>"If I'd actually wanted you to twist yourselves up and burn yourselves out around this," said the Watcher, "I could have designed an adversarial lecture that would have driven everybody in this room halfway crazy - except for Keltham.&nbsp; He's not just immune because he's an agent with a slightly different utility function, he's immune because he instinctively doesn't switch off a kind of self-integrity that everyone else in this class needs to <em>learn </em>to not switch off so easily."</p>
              <p>It was a proud day for Keltham and a formative one, that dath ilan had acknowledged that the alien in their midst might have his uses.&nbsp; Like making it slightly easier to demonstrate a useful children's lesson for a class full of the smarter and more altruistic kids who would actually grow up to matter.&nbsp; But even so, there's a difference between growing up in a world that has&nbsp;<em>no</em> place for you and&nbsp;<em>no</em> use for you and respects&nbsp;<em>nothing</em> about you, versus a world which has&nbsp;<em>a</em> place for you and&nbsp;<em>some</em> use for you and&nbsp;<em>ever</em> really actually admits you can get some things right a little faster.</p>

              <p>The other thing he sees, from up here, is the point that his mind was put together the way it is, including the part where he's a kid who doesn't have to rush&nbsp;down the Path to stare at things like the truth that he couldn't have made a difference in dath ilan, and including the part where his contribution to diversity is pursuing the Way of being selfish and the things that selfish people can see faster than others, his <em>whole self</em> was put together, based on the assumption that he's in dath ilan, where, if Keltham is like that, terrible things <em>won't </em>happen to him.</p>

              <p>It's a piece of - something&nbsp;<em>wrong,</em> something he doesn't know, something he believes that's false - about this entire situation, this entire world.&nbsp; People not quite behaving like obvious models say they should.</p>
              <p>...or they just have so little internal stuff that is actually powered by self-reflection that not very much happens to them when they suddenly get amplified reflection?</p>
              <p>No, that also feels like one of those weird excuses that Keltham was coming up with inside, to dismiss puzzle pieces.</p>
              <p>Keltham does feel - annoyed, on some level, <em>injured</em> even, that there weren't more warning signs.&nbsp; He thought he was getting a perception boost or maybe the equivalent of +0.1sd at some innate mental quality, not <em>this</em>. &nbsp;Or, well, no, he didn't have that much of a model, he didn't really think about it at all, he didn't ask, because he was still mentally living in a world where everything that can hit you really hard has a clearly attached warning sign that Civilization put there.</p>

              <p>He is - not looking forwards as much, to his date with Carissa tonight, as he was an hour ago.&nbsp; Because he's looked back and reflected on himself, and on the whole headlong rush forwards that is a defining quality of Mad Investor Chaos.&nbsp; And now he is, in fact, thinking questioning thoughts about whether it is really in his own long-term self-interest - or <em>yes</em> the interest of a bunch of drowning children that&nbsp;<em>he does care about literally at all</em> even if he wants to be paid for saving them - for him to prioritize having sex with his research harem as one of his top goals on his second day in another universe.</p>
              <p>Should he actually be hesitant about that?&nbsp; It doesn't make sense, does it?&nbsp; He should not, in the face of this shock, have suddenly turned into a standard dath ilani.&nbsp; He is still himself, he should still have the parts of himself that are hyped for a date with Carissa.&nbsp; Being hit with a temporary spell <em>should not have changed those internal parts.</em>&nbsp; And if now his self is in a weird internal state of strife that prevents him from ever having any fun again - then he is pretty sure a Keeper would tell him that this is not the optimal way to get smashed and rearranged by a temporary reflectivity-increasing mind-affecting drug.</p>

              <p>So.&nbsp; They obviously haven't been told.&nbsp; Which, earlier, Ione thought in the back of her mind would happen as soon as the security wizard walked out after gouging her eye, because they'd tell her former classmates about the new security risk, because all of Cheliax would unite against her in hating her and hurting her as much as they could short of killing her.&nbsp; Apparently the part where, by default, security doesn't tell anyone anything, takes higher precedence.</p>
              <p>Also she is now&nbsp;<em>visibly </em><em>useful to the project</em> and that casts a different shade on the whole thing where - she knows how she wishes this would go, but to make security go along with it, she needs to have something to offer security, something to bargain with security, something that Nethys <em>wouldn't</em> require her to just hand over anyways -</p>
              <p>She also has to choose how to answer the expectant looks, now, even if it's silence she has to make it clearly deliberate -</p>
              <p>Ione thinks of something she can offer security, and picks her strategy to try with the other girls, because she doesn't want to spend the rest of her life with Keltham's other women being as cruel to her as won't kill her, whenever Keltham isn't looking.</p>
              <p>"So I'm not really sure," Ione says, using the glorious feeling of realizing her curse's real power to fuel a smile, "but I think Asmodeus cut a deal with Nethys, to go in on Keltham's project together, and I was the person here who was best suited to get the power from Nethys to summon temporary copies of books from other libraries plus whatever else it is I can do now.&nbsp; Didn't do it on purpose, just happened to me."</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Elias Abarco pulls off his invisibility, looking greatly annoyed. He's mostly annoyed because Ione doesn't seem to care about anybody; they spent the last couple hours checking up on familial and nonfamilial relations they could murder or nearly murder to make a point, and her parents sold her to the school and she has an older brother who by all accounts hates her and she hates him back. This is healthy and encouraged in young wizards but it's damn inconvenient when one is irritated with Ione Sala and really wants to rip something she cares about to pieces before her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>He nods to Paxti, because she was right and should know it.</p>
              <p>"She's still Lawful Evil," he says curtly. "Paxti, you should hit the rest of them, for being slow in reporting. Do you know the spell -"</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes."</p>
              <p>And he looks at Ione. Raises his eyebrows, slightly, nods even more slightly than that. And heads off to see why the damned bird is taking them so long, because it turns out that supervising a bunch of god-touched teenagers is the&nbsp;<em>worst.</em></p>

It's really cramping her style. But there is a halfling, or at least there might be, unless Asmodeus told Aspexia Rugatonn to do something different, which is not less terrifying, and so she doesn't want to particularly confront Ione, even though she has some good material for it, or even ask Ione for a book, which is what she'd do if there were slightly less at stake here, because it seems likely that Nethys's intervention here is part of what Otolmens is objecting to...</p>

              <p>Then Ione realizes she has to say, and it also works for her own benefit that she says it - "Note, though.&nbsp; Keltham thinks I'm a secret Nethys worshipper, and I've told him that probably most of you and most Chelish government officials wouldn't care, but that I wasn't sure.&nbsp; Security thinks that, once Keltham learns the spells to verify that I'm Nethys-touched, I can be a secret worshipper of Nethys here who confirms our stories to him.&nbsp; So don't treat me as anything except somebody with a weird book-fetching power, anywhere Keltham might see that.&nbsp; You are not supposed to know anything about me other than that, and even if you did, Keltham doesn't think that worshipping Nethys is something that'd get most people after me."</p>
              <p>It's a security advisory, it's clearly a correct security advisory, and if Ione gives it before anybody else does, it means Ione is somebody who sometimes says what the security advisories are.&nbsp; Which, obviously she absolutely will never abuse for anything Chelish security would not in fact like, she is a very good and cooperative oracle of Nethys, she is only securing her own safety among the lesser mortals who aren't security.</p>

You live, you stay in your library, you get the books we tell you to get, you study magic very diligently and impress Nethys, he likes high-circle casters, and you never again screw us over for the sake of your bargaining position, or I'll see to it you never hit third circle, and I don't think Nethys cares at all about people who have barely started studying magic.

            <div class='post-content'><p>There's a flare of hate in her then, now that she won't go to Hell for hating Asmodeus's servants.&nbsp; And with that hate, flashes of contempt, starting to arrange themselves around her sudden new identity.&nbsp; She is too scared, too shaking from being on fire for a minute, and too angry, not to think the thoughts that she is thinking now.</p>
              <p>You can make Asmodeans into high-level wizards, if you give them enough intelligence boosts, but you can't make them <em>think</em>.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>She's not particularly happy about having thought that, she doesn't actually <em>want</em> to insult the person in front of her if he's reading her mind, but the thought came to her anyways.</p>
              <p>The security wizard hasn't realized that this entire conversation has been predicted out by Nethys and Asmodeus, he isn't curious about the divine, he isn't keeping his eyes open and because of that he doesn't <em>see.</em>&nbsp; He's posturing about serving Asmodeus, and not realizing how this whole interaction they're having right now is something that Asmodeus no doubt had to work around and pay Nethys extra for in order to get a library oracle on His project.&nbsp; She hopes somebody in Hell has a very very long talk with him about that after he dies.</p>
              <p>Nethys has really gone to some lengths, in ways very visible to her, to make sure that Nethys can seriously threaten her and Chelish security <em>can't.</em></p>
              <p>She can't be <em>maledicted</em>, she can't be tortured for very long, if she's killed in the course of sincerely doing her duties that thought doesn't actually bother her at all if she gets to go to Nethys's afterlife and study magic forever instead of burning, and maybe Cheliax wouldn't dare kill her anyways because if she can't be <em>maledicted </em>somebody else might raise her and she'd talk all about Keltham.&nbsp; Ione Sala doesn't know what Nethys has set up against somebody cursing her stupider, but maybe it'll be too obvious to Keltham by then, or she can pray to Nethys for divine aid, or she could simply go to Keltham and tell him it's time to find a university who can Heal her better.&nbsp; Or maybe the higher-ups here are aware that cursing Nethys's oracle with stupidity <em>would</em> in fact constitute a serious slap in the face of a god, one who's very hard to keep out of things, on a site already subjected to extensive divine intervention.</p>
              <p>And she is too scared, too shaking, and too angry, not to think what she thinks then.</p>
              <p><em>That's not how compacts work, Asmodean.&nbsp; They're negotiated, not dictated.&nbsp; Nethys made very sure you wouldn't be able to escalate your threats against me to worse than what Nethys could do.&nbsp; Maybe you should call in a more experienced security officer who knows how to negotiate with non-Asmodeans you can't just maledict.&nbsp; Someone who understands what happens if you leave people scared of being set on fire and stupidified and your negotiating position does not, in fact, let you just keep escalating further until you send them to Hell.&nbsp; Non-Asmodeans stay on the lookout for ways to improve their bargaining positions, if they're scared and you haven't made a real deal with them, that's what happens.</em><em>&nbsp; I wasn't ambitious and I'm still not ambitious and I don't want really very much at all, if you negotiated terms with me I'd be very predictable and wouldn't even ask for very much, but if Asmodeus's representative wants Nethys's representative to be predictable, he needs to bargain for that and not just dictate.</em></p>
              <p>"I understand," Ione whispers out loud, meekly.&nbsp; He's either reading her thoughts like a halfway intelligent person or he's not; she'll see.</p>

            <div class='post-content'><p>Sure, he'll speak more slowly. "When Nethys chose you, you could have come to us. You went to Keltham instead, to try to position yourself better for a deal. We granted you that you would continue attending class with your little friends. When you realized you had book-summoning powers, you could have come to us. You showed them to Keltham instead, to try to make it more inconvenient to replace you.&nbsp;<em>Then,&nbsp;</em>you proposed your deal: that we don't set the other students against you, that despite all your behavior in the past two days we treat you like an Asmodean student and encourage them in the same. I agreed to that too. And then I told you: <em>don't do that again</em>. You want to stay here, falsely admired by your peers, trusted by Keltham? Great. That has been agreed to. You have that. But if you push us any farther, we will take you out of the picture. The deal is that there will not be further deals.</p>
              <p>I don't know why you think Asmodeus bargained for Nethys's intervention here. The Grand High Priestess said nothing of that, when she came to read your mind, and she pays a great deal of attention to the question of how we accidentally make ourselves more costly for Asmodeus to steer. I think <em>Nethys</em> paid <em>Asmodeus</em> for whatever He's doing, and if it costs Nethys more, that <em>serves my god;&nbsp;</em>that's what I think. If you are a small obedient little girl who only wants a few small things, then, having attained those small things, I don't see why you'd hesitate to agree that you'll stop withholding things from us, stop presenting them to Keltham first to try to force a concession from us afterwards, and stop trying to condition your obedience on our further concessions. The game you have played twice today, you will not be able to play a third time, have I said it enough ways you comprehend it now?"</p>

              <p>"Oracle of Nethys, Ione Sala, of the library's curse," she says, when her clothes are back on and she's sitting on the ground.&nbsp; "My god has either joined with your god, or been paid by Him to assist, on a project to bring another plane's knowledge to Cheliax.&nbsp; I require a bed either in the library, or in a room immediately adjacent to it.&nbsp; Aside from this, I am content with ordinary student-level sustenance and living conditions, which you will not worsen or withhold. &nbsp;You may either leave the other students here ignorant about my true nature, or tell them but then instruct them further not to mistreat me in any way whatsoever whether or not Keltham is watching.&nbsp; I understand there may be some restrictions on me.&nbsp; These restrictions need to mostly not prevent me from providing the services that Nethys intended me to offer this project.&nbsp; Whatever pay or equity is negotiated by Keltham for the participants in his project, will be allowed to actually accrue to me if it actually accrues to any single one of the other girls, and Cheliax can't take it from me including by unexpected fees or cost increases.&nbsp; You don't do anything clever to work around all that and make my life worse."</p>
              <p>"In exchange, I will cooperate with Chelish security, on the understanding that they treat me as a friendly representative of the allied god Nethys and not an Asmodean traitor who gets set on fire at somebody's whim.&nbsp; If we have disagreements, we work them out by negotiating as equals, not by a wizard who works for Cheliax showing up and gouging out my eye.&nbsp; If at some point you come up with something extra that you want from me, don't threaten me into it, offer me an interesting book.&nbsp; Or a magic item.&nbsp; Or if you want me to do almost anything, you can offer me my brother as my slave.&nbsp; Apart from that, I don't think I have any long-term goals besides pleasing Nethys enough to get a good Nethysian afterlife.&nbsp; I'm not impatient to reach ninth circle here instead of there."</p>
              <p>"If you manage to come up with a brilliant way to screw me on this deal, it's off, because I'm not an Asmodean and you're not a devil and this isn't a contract between two Asmodeans, it's a Nethysian-Asmodean deal.&nbsp; I'm Lawful and I'll keep my deals that are actually sensible deals for sensible people being sensible about them.&nbsp; I'm not an Asmodean any more, and I won't keep a contract that an Asmodean twisted around."</p>
              <p>"What makes Ione Sala predictable is when she thinks she can be safe if she stays predictable, which mostly means that she needs to be safe from Nethys's displeasure.&nbsp; The main thing that causes me to start looking for ways to improve my bargaining position with Cheliax, is if it looks to me like Cheliax might suddenly decide to do anything it wants to me at any time, especially things that might hinder my service to my god, unless my bargaining position is better.&nbsp; I will remember your claim that security would have worked with me if I'd come directly to them, and if you keep your side of things, I will try coming straight to you at least the next time I think I see something Nethys would want me to do.&nbsp; I hear your claim that my doing anything else unpredictable makes me too much of a liability and I will be killed no matter what after that, which I understand would make it hard to continue doing what Nethys wants me to do, and I understand Nethys would see that as a betrayal if I let it happen on purpose."</p>
              <p>"Our gods have an obvious common interest.&nbsp; We don't have to fight.&nbsp; I respect what Asmodeus has to offer this project.&nbsp; I hope Cheliax respects what Nethys has to offer."</p>
              <p>Ione finishes talking.&nbsp; She's trying to tense her entire body so it will stop&nbsp;<em>fucking trembling</em> and she knows she can't do this for much longer.</p>

              <p><em>He</em> wouldn't set somebody on fire, if they were implicated in the possible end of the world.&nbsp; They might explode.&nbsp; Broom thought about trying to do something, but before he was done hesitating, the girl wasn't on fire any more, and then she was still talking disrespectfully to the powerful wizard who had just set her on fire.</p>
              <p>That does seem like the sort of person who might destroy the world, either by accident or on purpose?</p>
              <p>The conversation afterwards didn't make it seem like Ione Sala was planning to do that right away, but Broom is still feeling somewhat worried.&nbsp; He can imagine somebody carrying the sort of grudge, from being set on fire, where they decide to destroy the world about it.&nbsp; Especially if it's been happening to them regularly.&nbsp; <em>He</em> doesn't like being whipped and healed and whipped again.&nbsp; He <em>hated</em> that one time of his life where it was happening to him a lot.&nbsp; He just didn't have any options for doing anything about that, such as, for example, destroying the world.</p>
              <p>It is not&nbsp;entirely clear to Broom that Chelish security quite understands how to avoid making giant messes or how to clean them up, which, he supposes, makes sense of why some god named "Otolmens" would randomly grab Broom in the hallway and tell him to do it.</p>
