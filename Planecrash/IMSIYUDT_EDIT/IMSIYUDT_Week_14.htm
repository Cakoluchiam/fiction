            <div class="post-content"><p>It sure isn't.&nbsp; Maillol acidly tells Sevar that nobody needed to promise Keltham that people were actively working to identify his god, up until that point they had the&nbsp;<em>option</em> of saying later that somebody spotted it as Abadar but that they were worried about his adopting Osirion's sexual morals or just that <em>people were still consulting each other about if that was allowable to disclose.</em></p>
              <p>This is,&nbsp;<em>mostly,</em> the fault of somebody whose screaming can be distantly heard in Maillol's office, because he was&nbsp;<em>fucking fed up</em> with this whole scenario and this screaming is at least a little&nbsp;<em>consoling.</em>&nbsp; Much worse for that guy, he's getting a permanent notation on his file saying that he doesn't think fast enough on his feet to take point on complicated situations, like that incident with Otolmens's oracle.&nbsp; Whom Carissa was also responsible for <em>remembering the existence of,</em> even if it wouldn't have been her job to try to yank the guy out of the room fast enough.</p>
              <p>Maybe it was somebody else's fuckup who put her in a bad situation, but she is now the one responsible for recoveries, and on the Abadar thing she muffed the recovery.</p>
              <p>"You're going to spend an hour practicing with Elias," Maillol tells Carissa.&nbsp; "He's going to throw situations at you where Keltham runs across something we've been hiding or sees something he shouldn't, you're going to come up with excuses, fast.&nbsp; If they involve you saying that you've got to talk to me before you can figure out what you're authorized to say now, that's not great, but Elias won't hit you."&nbsp; Ferrer's sickening fake smile vanishes.&nbsp; "Any time you start <em>saying too much</em> in front of Imaginary Keltham and making up excuses that are <em>any more complicated than they need to be,</em> Elias is going to hit you."</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>"I acknowledge my errors. I acknowledge I need the practice and I know if I argue you're going to make it longer, which you are very welcome to. To my mind we never meaningfully had the option of telling him it was Abadar. Abadar has a country right near here and he already knows that, and it's an incredibly obvious place to go when he gets fed up and leaves. If you want him to even contemplate hiding out in a forest or extradimensional space somewhere and not contacting other governments he needs to think he has an <em>obscure&nbsp;</em>god, not one running a country right next door. He's not stupid enough to fail to think that I might be lying about the sexism or that there might be a good justification for it, and it's not an argument-against-Abadar strong enough to stop Keltham trying to contact them. You should find him an obscure Tian deity.</p>
              <p>I appreciate that you are monitoring a tendency towards excuses more complicated than they need to be. I am noticing a tendency towards plans that require <em>using a degree of ability to manipulate Keltham's environs&nbsp;</em>which I would prefer he believe&nbsp;<em>Golarion magic does not enable. </em>&nbsp;The High Priestess asked me, this morning, if my recommendation that we explain Otolmens to Keltham overrode her very reasonable heuristics about sharing less about Otolmens, and I was not willing to persist in a recommendation against such advice, but if I'd thought through that her plan involved us consistently deploying reflexive counterspells to protect the invisibility of Otolmens' representative while Keltham flings around fourth-circle cleric magic aimed at discovering concealed things, I <em>would </em>have persisted in my recommendation.&nbsp; If Invisibility Purge hadn't discovered Otolmens' oracle Glimpse of Truth would have, you can't inconspicuously counterspell True Seeing, and <em>then </em>it's apparent we deliberately hid him from Invisibility Purge discovery. If I had thought of the oracle fast enough I would've told Security to do nothing using abilities other than 'put people in other rooms', and if that wasn't fast enough to solve the problem, so be it. Abadar's going to keep giving Keltham spells in that genre, and honestly the oracle is the most innocuous explanation for them. 'have an invisible person running around with Security constantly counterspelling and actively interfering in Keltham's efforts to discover them' is an extraordinary expenditure of our effort to keep a secret I at this point <em>forcefully recommend </em>we stop keeping. Otolmens is the kind of institution Keltham is used to cooperating with and we should tell him sufficient true things for him to conclude that."</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>"Your argument on Abadar is reasonable and I have downgraded my estimate of the severity of your error.&nbsp; It remains that your current excuses are too <em>visibly</em> extemporized.&nbsp; Your excuses wouldn't fool&nbsp;<em>me,</em> Sevar, they <em>look</em> like excuses to somebody who knows what that <em>is.</em>&nbsp; I'm not saying you should be choosing excuses to fool me, you should be choosing them to fool Keltham.&nbsp; But right now, we're only getting away with this because Keltham is an outsider, and that makes us <em>pathetic</em> and unworthy of the responsibility Asmodeus placed on us.&nbsp; Yes, you need a dose of that practice now and not just later.&nbsp; That you're already exhausted is part of the point.&nbsp; Twenty minutes with Elias today, more later, and don't mistake the reduction for mercy, it's about the degree to which you being slightly better-rested tomorrow is a military priority."</p>
              <p>"I've filed your request for somebody who can train you in conventional honeypot tactics.&nbsp; I've filed your request for the alternate Taldor history, and put my own commendation and priority on it; it's not just a workable idea, it gives us an organizing principle that this <em>chaos</em> of an operation desperately needs.&nbsp; We'll tell Broom that we're fine with Keltham's terms for showing himself in front of Keltham, and ask him politely not to stalk Keltham invisibly until we see how much Invisibility Purge Keltham throws around, assuming that's what you meant.&nbsp; I'll re-query our policy on keeping Otolmens's existence a secret to the people authorized to make decisions that potentially destroy Golarion.&nbsp; You'll brief the girls tomorrow morning on your new plans.&nbsp; Am I missing anything, Sevar?"</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>"No, sir." It is in some strange way cheering, to be told that they are pathetic and unworthy of the responsibility Asmodeus placed on them, because of course all humans are pathetic and unworthy but it only merits comment if in this context they are expected&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>to be. Maybe sometimes when the stakes are high enough some humans figure out how to not be pathetic and unworthy. Or at least how to be less so.</p>

              <p>She looks over at Elias. How much does he look like he would prefer this training to involve hitting her a lot. ...yeah, valid. Carissa, too, if she were in a different role in this operation, would feel like hitting Carissa a lot.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Keltham learns that you're getting sex training."</p>
              <p>"....well obviously I'm getting sex training, he's had it and I'd like to keep up! Also I figured I should see a professional about my relaxation problem."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Keltham learns primary worship of other gods is illegal."</p>
              <p>"Primary worship means, like, breaking<em> other </em>local law specifically on the command of foreign gods; it's mentioned as separately illegal from the breaking other local law because most of the general rules about criminal conspiracies don't apply very neatly to criminal conspiracies where you never interact with your co-conspirators and don't know anything about what exactly they're trying to achieve. Obviously if you're not breaking any laws in the first place then what would it even mean to make it illegal to worship a god."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Keltham learns Cheliax executes people for lèse-majesté."</p>
              <p>"I've never heard of that actually happening. It's a thing people say about kings they dislike and probably at some point in history was true of some of them but Abrogail Thrune's not a thin-skinned maniac whose brain stopped fully functioning thirty years ago, like a lot of kings are, and most king-related abuses are those kings."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Keltham learns that the girls sold their souls."</p>
              <p>"Most people make arrangements before they die, with a devil who has a specialty they're interested in or who lives in the plane of Hell they want to live in or whatever. The alternative is getting thrown into general processing, which can be slow, when a lot of people die at once, and it can be expensive and take a long time to get somewhere right for you. The girls hadn't yet because they're so young but now they're at elevated risk of death and&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>have highly secret information so I'm not surprised they made arrangements."</p>
              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Keltham learns that that vision was of Asmodean Hell."</p>

              <p>An hour isn't really much time to write down that many cleric spells and one-sentence descriptions, but here's what Ione's got!</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>Ione, on reflection, is feeling concerned about Cheliax's chances of fooling Keltham if Abadar grants more carefully-chosen spells like <em>Abadar's Truthtelling</em>. &nbsp;The Asmodeans may be out of their depth here; possibly she, as a smarter Nethysian, should actually grab that library book and start working out strategies for Cheliax to follow if Abadar grants Keltham a spell like <em>Lesser Planar Ally</em>, or a <em>Conditional Favor</em> that Keltham uses with a condition of 'don't lie to me'.</p>
              <p>Well, Asmodeus isn't actually stupid like some of His worshippers, Ione doesn't think. &nbsp;Maybe He'll grant the clerics here appropriate spells like <em>False Future</em> in case Keltham gets <em>Augury</em>, and <em>Undetectable Alignment</em> in case Keltham uses <em>Aura Sight</em> on Ione, and obviously <em>Spell Gauge</em> so they're not caught off-guard by what Keltham receives... though <em>Spell Gauge </em>only goes up to 3rd circle, and you'd need a 7th-circle caster to get all of Keltham's spells up to there...</p>
              <p>Does Cheliax have a plan B? &nbsp;Is Ione part of it? &nbsp;She's an obvious person that Keltham might try to whisper to, if Keltham notices something wrong. &nbsp;She should ask about that later.</p>

I think one full bookshelf should do it, but two would be better."&nbsp; She wants to ask, rather acerbically, if any Asmodean even <em>noticed</em> that their plan wouldn't work without Lord Nethys propping it up, but she is not quite that courageous yet.</p>

              <p>By way of distraction, he first wrote down memory-anchors for all his pending sex questions to submit to Carissa later while they're not in the middle of sex - this being, in dath ilan, a completely reasonable and well-known tactic to overcoming the distracting conversations that are the fundamental obstacle to sex.&nbsp; Plus, he needed to do that before they slipped his mind.</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>The first thing he should do is reserve a condition for "my god can't communicate with me in this way".&nbsp; Arguendo:&nbsp; This could obviously be done by expending one spell slot to signal just 'this communication channel works at all', which spell's absence then means that nothing else worked.&nbsp; Counter-arguendo: that might be redundant if the other consistent states of the code seem sufficiently unlikely to arise by chance or optimization around other criteria, since the absence of a consistent code state would automatically imply channel failure; Keltham isn't going to pick some intricate code that makes full use of every possible bit of information in every spell choice, since that might not make it across the 'prayer' communication medium going the other direction.&nbsp; Counter-counter-arguendo:&nbsp; During initial establishment of this communications channel, probably a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of bits should be expended on error codes.&nbsp; Suppose for now that some very exotic spell gets picked to signal the condition 'this works as a communication channel at all', and its absence indicates failure of the whole scheme.</p>
              <p>Or maybe, if he gets a long enough spell list, he can have a choice of four otherwise unused spells, signaling:</p>
              <p>Question 1:&nbsp; Does this communications channel work?</p>
              <p>Spell 1.1:&nbsp; This communications channel should work fine.<br>Spell 1.2:&nbsp; This communications channel works at all, but may have errors.<br>Spell 1.3:&nbsp; This communications channel is very expensive.&nbsp; Use it very sparingly.<br>Spell 1.4:&nbsp; This communications channel is both expensive and error-prone.<br>1.(none of the above):&nbsp; Basic channel failure.</p>
              <p>Plus actually:</p>
              <p>Spell 1.5: &nbsp;Some element of the code you used is problematic. &nbsp;Try again with a different code.&nbsp; Other spells received should not be interpreted.</p>
              <p>And Keltham should not ask too many questions, on the rest of this first try, before he finds out whether cases 1.3/1.4 hold.</p>
              <p>What does he&nbsp;<em>really really</em> need to know?</p>
              <p>Question 2:&nbsp; What overall strategy is appropriate to his current situation?</p>
              <p>Spell 2.1:&nbsp; Take your current situation at face value and cooperate with the surrounding project.<br>Spell 2.2:&nbsp; Your current situation is not what it seems, use tomorrow's code for more info; but it's still good to go on doing research.<br>Spell 2.3:&nbsp; Exercise your supposed right to leave, as soon as you can use tomorrow's code to figure out where to go.&nbsp; Stall them on more valuable info in the meanwhile.<br>Spell 2.4:&nbsp; They wouldn't actually let you leave.&nbsp; Ask about escape or other options using tomorrow's code.&nbsp; Stall info.<br>Spell 2.5:&nbsp; You are in imminent danger.&nbsp; IMMEDIATELY ask to leave your current location and go somewhere else in Cheliax or a Lawful Neutral country if accessible, taking with only Carissa as a guide and not telling anyone else where you're going.<br>Spell 2.none:&nbsp; None of those are good ways of looking at it.</p>
              <p>Keltham has of course realized that there's variants of 2.5 which imply he shouldn't take Carissa with him either; but if the situation is that bad, they won't just let him leave; and if they won't just let him leave, he's going to need more communication to figure out what he should do instead.&nbsp; It's not like he can see any obvious escape plan as things stand.</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>Actually, now that Keltham thinks about it... he was planning to use a more elaborate code, and ask more questions besides those two; but maybe he shouldn't even be asking any more than this, on a first try at a channel.&nbsp; It might not support that much weight.</p>
              <p>Well, that does leave some room to potentially factor things, and maybe Keltham's own communications will be a bit clearer if he considers more branch points and fewer total leaves.</p>
              <p>Version two:<br><br></p>
              <p>Question 1: &nbsp;Does this communications channel work?</p>
              <p>Spell 1.1: &nbsp;This channel works.<br>Spell 1.none:&nbsp; Total channel failure.</p>
              <p>Question 2: &nbsp;Is this channel significantly expensive to Keltham's god?</p>
              <p>Spell 2.1: &nbsp;Yes.<br>Spell 2.2:&nbsp; A little expensive, use it only as needed.<br>Spell 2.3:&nbsp; Not at all, use it lots.<br>Spell 2.none:&nbsp; Wrong question / channel failure / this question wasn't worth answering.</p>
              <p>Question 3:&nbsp; Is this channel error-prone or noisy?</p>
              <p>Spell 3.1:&nbsp; No.<br>Spell 3.2:&nbsp; Yes, be careful.<br>Spell 3.3:&nbsp; It fails only negatively; you may miss a spell you should have got, but not receive one you shouldn't have received.<br>Spell 3.none:&nbsp; Wrong question / channel failure / not enough priority.</p>
              <p>Question 4:&nbsp; Could this channel handle more complex codes tomorrow?</p>
              <p>Spell 4.1:&nbsp; Yes.<br>Spell 4.none:&nbsp; No or not priority.</p>
              <p>Question 5:&nbsp; Should you be cooperating with your apparent coworkers, or stalling them on things that are really valuable/dangerous?</p>
              <p>Spell 5.1:&nbsp; Cooperate at least for tomorrow, inquire in more detail later.<br>Spell 5.2:&nbsp; Begin stalling, inquire in more detail later.</p>
              <p>This question is sufficiently important that 5.none is a good candidate for just signaling total comms failure, but redundancy.</p>
              <p>The other variations on v1's Question 2 don't actually imply any&nbsp;<em>immediate</em> change of policy besides stalling, except of course for:</p>
              <p>Question 6:&nbsp; <em>Imminent </em>danger at current location?</p>
              <p>Spell 6.1:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Flee with Carissa and tell nobody else where you're going.<br>Spell 6.none:&nbsp; Carrying out 6.1 wouldn't be a net improvement.</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>...that's actually 11 total spells to take on signaling meaning, compared to version 1... okay, the fine detail in spell 3.3 is not something he needs to know literally during initial handshake, which cuts v.2 down to ten spells total, and makes it superior to v.1 because of the lower local branching, clearer meanings, and more critical meta-info being conveyed earlier.&nbsp; Besides eliminating Spell 3.3, are there other improvements to be made here?</p>
              <p>Actually, eliminating 2/8ths of the total code seems like the sort of thing that could easily cross some key threshold for feasibility on the first try, so if he cuts down on Q2...</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>Version three, probably final:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Question 1: &nbsp;Does this communications channel work?</p>
              <p>Spell 1.1: &nbsp;This channel works.<br>Spell 1.none: &nbsp;Total channel failure.</p>
              <p>Question 2: &nbsp;Is this channel significantly expensive to Keltham's god?</p>
              <p>Spell 2.1: &nbsp;Not at all, use it lots.<br>Spell 2.none:&nbsp; Yes / somewhat / wrong question / channel failure.</p>
              <p>Question 3: &nbsp;Is this channel error-prone or noisy?</p>
              <p>Spell 3.1: &nbsp;No.<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Spell 3.2: &nbsp;Yes, be careful.</span><br>Spell 3.none:&nbsp; Yes / wrong question / channel failure / not enough priority.</p>
              <p>Actually on further reflection, he doesn't really need 3.2 here either, since 3.none can safely convey that information mixed into a wider bucket.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Question 4: &nbsp;Could this channel handle more complex codes tomorrow?</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Spell 4.1: &nbsp;Yes.</span><br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Spell 4.none: &nbsp;No or not priority.</span></p>
              <p>On yet further reflection, Keltham can just ask this question tomorrow, if he gets a 'no' on things being noisy.&nbsp; If 'yes' on things being noisy, but not expensive, he should construct a <em>redundant</em> code tomorrow instead of a complicated one.</p>
              <p>Question 4: &nbsp;Should you be cooperating with your apparent coworkers, or stalling them on things that are really valuable/dangerous?</p>
              <p>Spell 4.1: &nbsp;Cooperate at least for tomorrow, inquire in more detail later.<br>Spell 4.2: &nbsp;Begin stalling, inquire in more detail later.<br>Spell 4.none:&nbsp; Redundant signal of total channel failure.</p>
              <p>Question 5: &nbsp;Imminent danger at current location?</p>
              <p>Spell 5.1: &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Flee with Carissa and tell nobody else where you're going.<br>Spell 5.none: &nbsp;Carrying out 5.1 wouldn't be a net improvement and/or this channel element failed.</p>
              <p><br>Okay,&nbsp;<em>this</em> is a code Keltham can believe in, relative to his own level of design ability.&nbsp; It frontloads the most important meta-questions first, delays as many complications as possible beyond the fragile first attempt, and only requires him to keep five questions and six spell-meanings in mind to communicate across his own side of the 'prayer' channel.</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>Those spells, huh.&nbsp; Those sure are some spells.</p>
              <p>Aura Sight is on the list, but not Invisibility Purge; Glimpse of Beyond, but not Spell Immunity.&nbsp; If they'd had all the spells he knew about, but no new especially interesting ones, that would indicate that they were being first-order blatant about telling Ione what to include or exclude.&nbsp; If they'd omitted Aura Sight too, that might mean somebody didn't update Ione about the&nbsp;<em>new</em> list of what not to tell Keltham.&nbsp; This pattern indicates... either nothing much, or that they're able to do basic damn reflection about what Keltham is likely to think of things, and avoided there being any blatant pattern in the spell list so it would mean 'nothing much'.</p>
              <p>Anyways.&nbsp; He needs to pick his spell-request-pattern for tomorrow morning, and then sleep.&nbsp; There were probably other things he told himself to review today, but he is feeling a bit worn and not necessarily up for trying to remember what they all were. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll keep.</p>
              <p>Today he got four cantrips, six first-circle, four second-circle, three third-circle, two fourth-circle spells.&nbsp; Keltham should not assume his god can do that every time, so leave some headway at each level.</p>
              <p>He wants Guidance and Detect Magic among cantrips.&nbsp; If he had to pick spells on his own, he'd want at least one truth spell and at least one Comprehend Languages.&nbsp; Owl's Wisdom seems important to have in reserve for real emergencies, however dangerous it may be to dath ilani who didn't want to be Keepers, and you could say the same about Invisibility Purge.&nbsp; By default he's got the truth spell and Sanctuary to keep overnight, possibly cutting down expenses to his god some little bit.</p>
              <p>Are there any spells here that form useful mnemonic patterns with his questions and answers?&nbsp; Though he should maybe also try to pick spells that his god wouldn't try to urgently assign him for other reasons.&nbsp; And he needs to pick spells where he can see what they do, upon a cast, and without those spells harming the target.</p>

              </a>
            </div>
            <div class="post-content"><p>Oh <em>huh</em>, Keltham thinks, as he starts poking through the list for something weird enough that there's no way his god would assign it unless the communications channel worked.</p>
              <p>Early Judgment: give someone a glimpse of their currently destined afterlife.</p>
              <p>Now there's a spell he wouldn't have expected Cheliax to show him if they were really trying to prevent him from figuring out his god, or for that matter, afterlives. &nbsp;Can he use that to see somebody <em>else's</em> destined afterlife too, and determine their real alignment even if they're not third-circle?&nbsp; That definitely goes on the list, not as a code, just as a default request -</p>
              <p>(At this point, Keltham's translation spell runs out, but somebody is timing things pretty well, and somebody arrives back to cast Share Language (Taldane) on him again.)</p>
              <p>Lay of the Land (2nd) grants instant knowledge of the surrounding lands; it sounds like an unambiguously interpretable spell to cast; and Keltham is unlikely to need it otherwise.&nbsp; Could be used to signal 'this worked at all' or to signal 'flee with Carissa'; semantically it's a better fit for the second.</p>
              <p>Stone Shape (3rd) - clearly interpretable, unlikely to be given otherwise.&nbsp; Mnemonically it could mean '4.1, show them how to make things'.&nbsp; At 3rd circle it's expensive, though.</p>
              <p>Create Food and Water (3rd again) - unmistakeable effect, mnemonically fits both '4.1 industrialize' and '5.1 flee'.&nbsp; He needs to look at cheaper spells though.</p>
              <p>Okay, Obscuring Mist (1st) has unmistakeable effect and would've been an obvious fit for 'this channel is noisy', but Keltham eliminated that answer-spell leaving only 'this channel is clear'... it also works for immediately fleeing with Carissa.&nbsp; Silly spells for silly adventurers, everything's going to look like it was designed for fleeing with Carissa.</p>
              <p>Air Bubble (1st)... <em>probably</em> not something his god would need to assign him otherwise, if he resolves not to do any chemistry experiments today, clearly visible effect, and it can stand for 'This channel is clear'.&nbsp; 3.1 or 1.1.</p>
              <p>Light... uses up a relatively precious cantrip slot, but it sure is unmistakeable.&nbsp; Another good fit for several different possible mnemonics.&nbsp; Hopefully not one his god would otherwise assign him.</p>
              <p>Create Water, likewise uses up a cantrip slot, but is unmistakeable and could mean 'this channel is cheap' because water is cheap.</p>
              <p>(Do they seriously mean <em>create water</em> and not just teleport it in, by the way?&nbsp; Because then why can't you also create very large amounts of energy?&nbsp; E^2 = P^2C^2 + M^2C^4 and all that.)</p>
              <p>Oh, Lighten Object (1st) would also do to convey that things weren't expensive.</p>
              <p>Share Language (2nd) would correspond very well to 'teach them' but it's also something a helpful, deaf god might assign if it thought that a student being able to hear a lecture in Baseline might be helpful to them.</p>
              <p>Silence (2nd) and Silent Table (2nd) are unmistakable and could mean some things.&nbsp; And Silent Table sounds less like it might be granted by a god that thought Keltham needed to flee.&nbsp; 2nd-circle is still expensive compared to 1st.</p>
              <p>Oh, and Read Weather is 1st and sounds unmistakeable and otherwise-improbable-to-get even if it doesn't <em>mean</em> much.&nbsp; At this point Keltham is ready to compromise on some meanings.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>So, attempted code, v1:</p>
              <p>1.1 Read Weather (1st):&nbsp; This channel works at all, and can tell you things, like the Weather.<br>2.1 Lighten Object (1st):&nbsp; This channel doesn't cost much.<br>3.1 Air Bubble (1st):&nbsp; This channel is clear.</p>
              <p>That uses up all his 1st slots if he keeps Sanctuary and a truth spell, and requests a new Comprehend Languages.&nbsp; Wait, didn't he want to keep one 1st-circle slot clear in case his god can't assign him six first-level spells every day?&nbsp; Well, it's probably a little safer if he's keeping some of his old spells... hopefully?&nbsp; He may not have better options.&nbsp; In 2nd, he already has a request for Early Judgment and emergency Owl's Wisdom, 4 slots total of which he should leave one free, and:</p>
              <p>5.1:&nbsp; Lay of the Land (2nd):&nbsp; Run.</p>
              <p>Okay, so instead of using expensive 3rds, what if on the topic of whether to speak freely or stall:</p>
              <p>4.1:&nbsp; Light (0th):&nbsp; Shed light on their ignorance.<br>4.2:&nbsp; Create Water (0th):&nbsp; Stall with a great volume of cheap stuff.</p>
              <p>Those are alternates, so they only use up one cantrip slot, leaving the other two free for Guidance and Detect Magic, and the fourth for his god's choice, or empty because his god strained itself to give him so many spells before.</p>
              <p>And then when it comes to 3rd and 4th... he could mostly leave that up to his god, but if his god wants any suggestions, Keltham will go on Invisibility Purge for 3rd and... he doesn't really have much he&nbsp;<em>wants</em> in 4th.&nbsp; Well, he could ask for Tongues and use that to free up the valuable 1st-level slot occupied by Comprehend Languages.&nbsp; Actually, can clerics request lower-level spells in higher spell 'slots'?&nbsp; That would make his life noticeably simpler in this regard and save his god money.&nbsp; Keltham should have asked this question earlier.</p>

              <p>- and to survive the next hour! Let's do that one first! It's a test, obviously it's a test, but there are all kinds of things one tests for. Loyalty, the willingness to say 'I serve my Queen' even when it's a losing move in the moment. Theological purity, going through the right mental motions on your way to the truth. Strategic competence, where one gets to contemplate considerations like how, if this is real, immediately angering the powerful stranger is a poor path to protecting the Queen or the country.&nbsp;</p>

You do not serve a god by giving his interventions unexpected effects.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>So that's the question answered, but not the strategic situation at all resolved; only in tests for five year olds do you win by defiantly screaming the truth for all the world to hear. And the Church and Queen do diverge, sometimes, Maillol's story about the slave implied it, and it's possible this is a test from a different angle than Aspexia Rugatonn's. The first priority is to survive it, then to report it, then to seek correction in any mistaken details of her understanding of precisely why you do not overthrow the Queen of Cheliax.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"I presume myself to understand nothing about the Queen, or her House, or any matters in which I have not been directed," she says. "But I <em>was</em> directed that, if I serve Asmodeus in this world, I will be raised high in it, and so I will listen to your explanation; I assume you have more of one."</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>How could she&nbsp;<em>possibly&nbsp;</em>win this. She hasn't prepared her spells yet. - she isn't sure if she'll get enough sleep tonight, to prepare her spells. One should of course die for their country as needed, but if there's a plot against the Queen it is better to live to report it. She can try talking her way into getting more time unsupervised, but that kind of Splendour usually comes with excellent interpersonal reading and she shouldn't count on it. Can she cancel the candle. Quietly trigger a ward.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>Disrupting the candle seems doable but if the woman's smart the candle will have nothing to do with whatever protections might hide this conversation from security. She didn't even claim it did, just, 'while this candle burns', and while you're not supposed to give in to the temptation to speak to adversaries in beautiful technical-truths like that when a simple lie would do it's still information.</p>
              <p>"Well, see, I don't know how I'd like having a county; and it was pointed out to me that if it had been the will of Asmodeus that I have one He could have ordered it." And it feels like there's an incoherence, in the claim that Asmodeus wants a slave and not one who made a pact with Him to serve their own interests, and in claiming that Carissa's own interests point her towards power, but confusions there don't matter very much because there's already no way that the Church desires this and her top priority now isn't parsing out precisely why not. "And the throne, as you note, seems to burn one up sooner or later, besides which it feels implausible you'd go to all this trouble to put someone else on it."</p>

              <p>Sure, fine, she'll do the five year old thing; she doesn't, actually, see how to do better, and it's a way to keep talking. "They teach different shards of Asmodeanism, I think, to nobles. I haven't learned them. I don't know how the Queen justifies herself, or if she needs to; perhaps she acted only directed by the advisors Asmodeus sent her, more loyal and obedient than she cares to have anyone guess. But I know what's going on <em>here</em>. A lot is going on here, and it's very important; more important to Asmodeus, I think, than how mortals He owns conceive of their loyalty to Him, even mortals who are the Queen. He intervened<em> here, </em>so that our pathetic inadequate efforts to represent Him and our country here might stand a chance of success they otherwise wouldn't. I'm supposed to be here. And if I invent a way to correct the flaws in human nature and make us His worthy servants, then perhaps I'll get some titles out of that, as it pleases the Queen, but if I merely learn for Cheliax how the exact same bit of metal is manufactured three thousand times over to a precision so high they will&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>interlock then I will still have wisely spent the resources that Crown and Church have allocated here. And I would have to be an&nbsp;<em>idiot&nbsp;</em>to risk&nbsp;<em>any of that&nbsp;</em>to correct some flaw in Cheliax that is in the&nbsp;<em>slightest&nbsp;</em>less time sensitive.</p>

              <p>And once again there is the&nbsp;<em>infernal&nbsp;</em>difficulty that if it's a test it is not always obvious what is being tested. And that it being a test doesn't at all mean you can't die of failing it.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>The obvious reflexive 'no' would not be useful information, to the genuine Queen of Cheliax; the thought process might be, but she'll have to let it play out, and she doesn't actually know its exact contents until it plays out, which -</p>
              <p>- it would be so irritating, to mostly have peoples' minds full of thoughts about whether you're going to kill them. Carissa will strive to avoid that. The other obvious not-reassuring answer is that this is not guidance Aspexia Rugatonn would give -</p>
              <p>- because Asmodeus doesn't overthrow Pharasma -</p>
              <p>- because even if you wanted the Queen of Cheliax taken out you would not involve any third circle wizards in your plans, they are weak enough to actively be far more of a liability than an aid -</p>
              <p>- because Asmodeus's directions to Carissa are narrow, and Aspexia Rugatonn wants to interpret them narrowly, do the obvious things and not other things that cloud Asmodeus's vision with noise and confusion -</p>
              <p>- but it is true that Chelish monarchs get assassinated a lot, presumably with the Church's implicit support, so maybe Carissa is the one misunderstanding, believing that Asmodeanism does actually say you shouldn't murder your Queen.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- some part of Carissa's brain chimes up that she shouldn't murder the Queen because the Queen is really pretty. Thank you that part of Carissa's brain for reminding her that humans are fundamentally contemptible beings.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>- Carissa notes that the only people ever to have been acknowledged as killing a King or Queen of Cheliax is another of House Thrune, presumably because for everyone else Asmodeus's law does apply and does ban regicide and if you succeed they still put you to death, they don't make you a deal. That might even be part of the pact, that House Thrune can play among themselves but needn't fear their entire country made weapons pointed at them, needn't fear the chaos of being Taldor or of the civil wars before Hell rose to power in Cheliax -</p>
              <p>- there are rules here and she doesn't know them -</p>

              <p>"Ferrer Maillol is a competent administrator, as Asmodean priests go, but he lacks vision."&nbsp; Abrogail's voice is not at all seductive, now, it commands, <em>demands.</em>&nbsp; "We are <em>not</em> satisfied with Cheliax being taught the outsider's secrets of metalworking.&nbsp; We do not expect Lord Asmodeus will be satisfied with it either.&nbsp; Not if <em>other</em> countries also come to possess those secrets.&nbsp; We desire that Cheliax gain <em>advantage</em> from this, Carissa Sevar.&nbsp; Why our Lord has instructed that we do not simply keep the outsider for our own, I do not know for certain, but it is not an instruction I intend to defy."</p>
              <p>"This being so, we <em>particularly</em> desire that Cheliax not be left in an unfortunate position by an outsider propagating a powerful Lawful Neutral philosophy which enables its masters to unravel secrets of the magicless and perhaps the magical world; but which, introduced to Chelish students, inevitably casts them into heresy, so that only priests and the soul-sold slaves of Asmodeus can safely be taught it.&nbsp; We do not have enough of those to compete with Osirion and Lastwall if <em>all </em>their wizards and clerics and tinkerers are being taught those new ways.&nbsp; If the outsider teaches widely elsewhere it will be a trivial matter to steal his teachings, but we must be able to <em>use</em>&nbsp;what we copy."</p>
              <p>"Maillol's previous instructions to you are <em>revoked.</em>&nbsp; His understanding of Asmodeus's will <em>failed.</em>&nbsp; You have <em>no</em> priority higher than learning the core source of power of Keltham's world, and transforming it into a form that Asmodean students can learn and remain Asmodeans.&nbsp; Better yet, burn and refine their iron to <em>steel</em><em>,</em> show what their philosophy can become when it embraces power and <em>pain</em>, and wield that to raise a force that could crush dath ilan under our heel.&nbsp; Do that, and <em>I,</em> as Asmodeus's designate here, will say that you served Him well, and raise you high within this world."</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>Keltham wakes up more muzzily than the previous day, to dawn's light coming through his windows.&nbsp; The non-fully-opaqueable windows seem less like a design flaw if clerics have to pray for their spells during the dawn hour.</p>
              <p>All right.&nbsp; Let's do this.</p>
              <p>Keltham reviews his notes from the previous night, written appropriately cryptically, and then prays, trying to cast his mind Beyond, maybe in the direction that wasn't the three space or one time, looking toward his deity: the Lawful Neutral god of people wanting to follow the protocols they must follow in order for their interactions to be mutually beneficial, come to the Pareto frontier, coordinate without vast enforcement costs, summing to powerful societies and markets even when people largely pursue their own individual interests individually, because they never step on others in order to do that.</p>
              <p>Requests, obviously subject to amendation should his unknown god deem there to be better spells he could get:</p>
              <p>0th:&nbsp; Detect Magic, Guidance<br>1st:&nbsp; Comprehend Languages, Truthspell, keep Sanctuary<br>2nd:&nbsp; Owl's Wisdom, Early Judgment<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3rd:&nbsp; Invisibility Purge</span> actually, how about his god only reassigns him Invisibility Purge, or Glimpse of Beyond, if Keltham <em>still</em> might need it<br>3rd:&nbsp; Owl's Wisdom, actually Honest Pricing also seems good here<br>4th:&nbsp; Early Judgment</p>
              <p>And&nbsp;<em>also:</em></p>
              <p>If conditional spell assignment works at all for communication with his god, please assign Read Weather (1st).<br>If the communication doesn't cost much, please assign Lighten Object (1st).<br>If the communication seems like it should be error-free and reliable, please assign Air Bubble (1st).<br>If Keltham should speak freely and teach as much as he can to his hosts, please assign Light (0th).<br>If Keltham should instead stall them with relatively less dangerous material, please assign Create Water (0th).<br>And if Keltham should run the ass out of here today with just Carissa and tell nobody else where he's going, please assign Lay of the Land (2nd).</p>
              <p>Any remaining slots should be assigned as his god sees fit.</p>
              <p>...Keltham would also like to talk, if now is a better time than yesterday, for whatever reason.&nbsp; Keltham has many questions about how he can best cooperate in a mutually beneficial way with his god.</p>

              <p>However, Pharasma has NOT had time to review the second, third, fourth, or most recently FIFTH additional reports that Otolmens THEN had to file dealing with the ABSURD and INCREASINGLY RAPID escalation of DIVINE INTERVENTIONS around the region She SPECIFICALLY SAID everyone needed to STOP intervening in.&nbsp; Abadar may be familiar with the THIRD report in this sequence.&nbsp; It concerns the mortal's acquisition of SEVEN CLERIC LEVELS.&nbsp; Yet ANOTHER report concerns an intervention by ASMODEUS who Otolmens is aware is GOOD FRIENDS with ABADAR.&nbsp; Then there are interferences by NETHYS and for some reason CAYDEN CAILEAN and Otolmens is still wondering what IOMEDAE was doing in that pseudohypothetical chat.</p>
              <p>Otolmens is willing to entertain that there are possible replies to a prayer which would make further events LESS COMPLICATED, such as commanding the anomalous mortal to REMAIN STILL AND NOT MOVE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.&nbsp; Is Abadar planning to send a reply like that?</p>

            <div class="post-content"><p>It seems to Abadar that Otolmens might reasonably consider Asmodeus's conduct in Hell a threat to the stability of the Material Plane, if concealing it is necessary to prevent threats to the stability of the Material Plane and Asmodeus has never before been bothered to conceal this. It seems to Abadar that the mortal wants a nice rich stable world, and is more likely to endanger it if he ends up getting the wrong subset of information about the world, like might happen if you are Asmodeus and maliciously lying to advance your own interests. It seems to Abadar that containing the mortal by trying to learn his dangerous secrets while concealing Asmodeus's own dangerous secrets is an obviously doomed plan and it's absurd for Otolmens to countenance that and not countenance Abadar telling the mortal a small set of true non-inflammatory things such as 'Cheliax is lying to you' and 'my country has preexisting contractual arrangements for similar situations and will respect your intellectual property'.</p>

              <p>Well, Nethys is proud to announce that Nethys DOES have a plan!&nbsp; Definitely!&nbsp; A plan that encompasses even Abadar's own predictable reactions to how things are going so far!&nbsp; Nethys isn't going to tell you anything about the objective of that plan, though.&nbsp; Then you would get bored and stop looking, and Nethys finds it useful to overhear your conversations.</p>
