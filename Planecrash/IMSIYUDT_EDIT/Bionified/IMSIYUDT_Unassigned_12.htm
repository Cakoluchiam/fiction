          <div class='post-content'><p>Zon-Kuthon keeps mostly to Himself, by His own choice, but also by choice of the other gods.&nbsp; When somebody of the same kind as yourself wanders into the Void and comes back with inverted values, there is an uncertainty about whether, if you talked to the victim too much, something infohazardous might start to happen to you.&nbsp; Zon-Kuthon negotiates little, or not at all; He has little, or no, use for alliances and dealings.&nbsp; He keeps to Xovaikain, His true realm, and to Nidal, the material shadow of it.</p>
            <p>Before Zon-Kuthon, there was Dou-Bral, who helped fight and imprison Rovagug.&nbsp; It is unclear whether Zon-Kuthon would in some new battle fight to preserve all the pain that exists in the world; or if, Dou-Bral having once thought that the joy and beauty of the world outweighed its pain, Zon-Kuthon would now think there was too much pleasure in Existence, and that it ought therefore to be destroyed.&nbsp; Or perhaps Dou-Bral was too optimistic, in the days when Dou-Bral fought to defend reality; and if Dou-Bral knew what would have become of Pharasma's world, He would have tried to destroy it, even as Zon-Kuthon apparently seems content with its continued existence.</p>
            <p>No other god in creation likes Zon-Kuthon.&nbsp; From Asmodeus's perspective He is a pretender to Lawful Evil; from the other Evil gods' perspective, an obsessed fanatic of no use to anyone; from the perspective of Neutral gods, an impediment; from the perspective of Good, a horror.</p>
            <p>Why then does Zon-Kuthon continue to exist?&nbsp; Among the less pleasant facts of reality is that among the real reasons why the other gods don't band together to destroy Zon-Kuthon is that, as the last Lawful Evil competitor to Asmodeus of any significance, He is a threat for other gods to hold over Asmodeus - that there is at least one other competitor they could back for Asmodeus's position, if He grew too troublesome. Iomedae and Sarenrae, to be clear, would not keep Zon-Kuthon around just as a foil to Asmodeus, if those four were the only gods that were; but in a world where the existence of Zon-Kuthon is a constant weight on the negotiating positions of Asmodeus and say Gorum, trying to destroy Zon-Kuthon could be a mistake even if that were possible.&nbsp; Iomedae is more calculating now than when She was human, because She is better at it; She would not destroy Zon-Kuthon if the end result was for Asmodeus to grow stronger and for Hell to last victorious.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>It sure isn't.&nbsp; Maillol acidly tells Sevar that nobody needed to promise Keltham that people were actively working to identify his god, up until that point they had the&nbsp;<em>option</em> of saying later that somebody spotted it as Abadar but that they were worried about his adopting Osirion's sexual morals or just that <em>people were still consulting each other about if that was allowable to disclose.</em></p>
            <p>This is,&nbsp;<em>mostly,</em> the fault of somebody whose screaming can be distantly heard in Maillol's office, because he was&nbsp;<em>fucking fed up</em> with this whole scenario and this screaming is at least a little&nbsp;<em>consoling.</em>&nbsp; Much worse for that guy, he's getting a permanent notation on his file saying that he doesn't think fast enough on his feet to take point on complicated situations, like that incident with Otolmens's oracle.&nbsp; Whom Carissa was also responsible for <em>remembering the existence of,</em> even if it wouldn't have been her job to try to yank the guy out of the room fast enough.</p>
            <p>Maybe it was somebody else's fuckup who put her in a bad situation, but she is now the one responsible for recoveries, and on the Abadar thing she muffed the recovery.</p>
            <p>"You're going to spend an hour practicing with Elias," Maillol tells Carissa.&nbsp; "He's going to throw situations at you where Keltham runs across something we've been hiding or sees something he shouldn't, you're going to come up with excuses, fast.&nbsp; If they involve you saying that you've got to talk to me before you can figure out what you're authorized to say now, that's not great, but Elias won't hit you."&nbsp; Ferrer's sickening fake smile vanishes.&nbsp; "Any time you start <em>saying too much</em> in front of Imaginary Keltham and making up excuses that are <em>any more complicated than they need to be,</em> Elias is going to hit you."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"I acknowledge my errors. I acknowledge I need the practice and I know if I argue you're going to make it longer, which you are very welcome to. To my mind we never meaningfully had the option of telling him it was Abadar. Abadar has a country right near here and he already knows that, and it's an incredibly obvious place to go when he gets fed up and leaves. If you want him to even contemplate hiding out in a forest or extradimensional space somewhere and not contacting other governments he needs to think he has an <em>obscure&nbsp;</em>god, not one running a country right next door. He's not stupid enough to fail to think that I might be lying about the sexism or that there might be a good justification for it, and it's not an argument-against-Abadar strong enough to stop Keltham trying to contact them. You should find him an obscure Tian deity.</p>
            <p>I appreciate that you are monitoring a tendency towards excuses more complicated than they need to be. I am noticing a tendency towards plans that require <em>using a degree of ability to manipulate Keltham's environs&nbsp;</em>which I would prefer he believe&nbsp;<em>Golarion magic does not enable. </em>&nbsp;The High Priestess asked me, this morning, if my recommendation that we explain Otolmens to Keltham overrode her very reasonable heuristics about sharing less about Otolmens, and I was not willing to persist in a recommendation against such advice, but if I'd thought through that her plan involved us consistently deploying reflexive counterspells to protect the invisibility of Otolmens' representative while Keltham flings around fourth-circle cleric magic aimed at discovering concealed things, I <em>would </em>have persisted in my recommendation.&nbsp; If Invisibility Purge hadn't discovered Otolmens' oracle Glimpse of Truth would have, you can't inconspicuously counterspell True Seeing, and <em>then </em>it's apparent we deliberately hid him from Invisibility Purge discovery. If I had thought of the oracle fast enough I would've told Security to do nothing using abilities other than 'put people in other rooms', and if that wasn't fast enough to solve the problem, so be it. Abadar's going to keep giving Keltham spells in that genre, and honestly the oracle is the most innocuous explanation for them. 'have an invisible person running around with Security constantly counterspelling and actively interfering in Keltham's efforts to discover them' is an extraordinary expenditure of our effort to keep a secret I at this point <em>forcefully recommend </em>we stop keeping. Otolmens is the kind of institution Keltham is used to cooperating with and we should tell him sufficient true things for him to conclude that."</p>

            <p>"When you enlist in the Chelish military you promise to go where you're needed. That is how every military in the world functions; do dath ilan militaries not require such oaths?"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Keltham learns that you're getting sex training."</p>
            <p>"....well obviously I'm getting sex training, he's had it and I'd like to keep up! Also I figured I should see a professional about my relaxation problem."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Keltham learns primary worship of other gods is illegal."</p>
            <p>"Primary worship means, like, breaking<em> other </em>local law specifically on the command of foreign gods; it's mentioned as separately illegal from the breaking other local law because most of the general rules about criminal conspiracies don't apply very neatly to criminal conspiracies where you never interact with your co-conspirators and don't know anything about what exactly they're trying to achieve. Obviously if you're not breaking any laws in the first place then what would it even mean to make it illegal to worship a god."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Keltham learns Cheliax executes people for lèse-majesté."</p>
            <p>"I've never heard of that actually happening. It's a thing people say about kings they dislike and probably at some point in history was true of some of them but Abrogail Thrune's not a thin-skinned maniac whose brain stopped fully functioning thirty years ago, like a lot of kings are, and most king-related abuses are those kings."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Keltham learns that the girls sold their souls."</p>
            <p>"Most people make arrangements before they die, with a devil who has a specialty they're interested in or who lives in the plane of Hell they want to live in or whatever. The alternative is getting thrown into general processing, which can be slow, when a lot of people die at once, and it can be expensive and take a long time to get somewhere right for you. The girls hadn't yet because they're so young but now they're at elevated risk of death and&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>have highly secret information so I'm not surprised they made arrangements."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Keltham learns that that vision was of Asmodean Hell."</p>

            <p>She writes down spells like <em>Augury</em> and <em>Conditional Favor</em> on a separate piece of scrap, since her guess is that those spells won't get passed, and if she guesses right she can maybe save herself rewriting the whole list.</p>

            <p>It's at this point that Ione gets interrupted to ask for her current draft, Ione realizes she lost track of time, and Ione frantically tries to write down at least some 3s and 4s while her 0s, 1s, and 2s get reviewed.</p>

This spell otherwise functions as make whole.<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Malediction &nbsp;-- &nbsp;Fuck with the entire afterlife system and send a paladin to the Abyss, it's not like Pharasma really gives a shit.</span><br>Neutralize Poison &nbsp; -- &nbsp;Immunizes subject against poison, detoxifies venom in or on subject.<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Planar Ally, Lesser &nbsp;-- &nbsp; Exchange services with a 6 HD extraplanar creature.</span></p>
            <p>Or is that safe to tell him about, now that they're under Forbiddance anyways?<br>No, because Keltham might ask to walk outside under guard for a few minutes.</p>
            <p>Sending &nbsp; -- &nbsp;Delivers short message anywhere, instantly, to someone the caster is familiar with.<br>Summon Monster IV &nbsp;-- &nbsp; Summons extraplanar creature to fight for you.<br>Tongues &nbsp;-- &nbsp; Speak and understand any language.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Ione, on reflection, is feeling concerned about Cheliax's chances of fooling Keltham if Abadar grants more carefully-chosen spells like <em>Abadar's Truthtelling</em>. &nbsp;The Asmodeans may be out of their depth here; possibly she, as a smarter Nethysian, should actually grab that library book and start working out strategies for Cheliax to follow if Abadar grants Keltham a spell like <em>Lesser Planar Ally</em>, or a <em>Conditional Favor</em> that Keltham uses with a condition of 'don't lie to me'.</p>
            <p>Well, Asmodeus isn't actually stupid like some of His worshippers, Ione doesn't think. &nbsp;Maybe He'll grant the clerics here appropriate spells like <em>False Future</em> in case Keltham gets <em>Augury</em>, and <em>Undetectable Alignment</em> in case Keltham uses <em>Aura Sight</em> on Ione, and obviously <em>Spell Gauge</em> so they're not caught off-guard by what Keltham receives... though <em>Spell Gauge </em>only goes up to 3rd circle, and you'd need a 7th-circle caster to get all of Keltham's spells up to there...</p>
            <p>Does Cheliax have a plan B? &nbsp;Is Ione part of it? &nbsp;She's an obvious person that Keltham might try to whisper to, if Keltham notices something wrong. &nbsp;She should ask about that later.</p>

            <p><em>Ohhhh.</em></p>
            <p>Lord Nethys&nbsp;<em>does</em> have some secret plan that encompasses His intricate understanding of every move that lesser beings make, thinking their choices their own.</p>
            <p>Going to fantastic lengths to make sure Keltham can get five books a day faster than Security could order them from Chelish libraries... doesn't make <em>that </em>much sense as the sole object of an expensive divine intervention, so Ione had supposed that she was going to be there to influence Keltham in a subtle way, or maybe see something that Asmodeans wouldn't see because they're too busy gouging each other's eyes out.</p>
            <p>"If you get Keltham to flee to a remote wilderness hideout, or some old dungeon that's blocked from scrying, he's not going to get much research done unless he has a library oracle with him," Ione observes.&nbsp; "Keltham knows that.&nbsp; He'll come to me early on.&nbsp; Maybe&nbsp;<em>first.</em>&nbsp; I'll need enough books to turn some room wherever I go, into a library... I think one full bookshelf should do it, but two would be better."&nbsp; She wants to ask, rather acerbically, if any Asmodean even <em>noticed</em> that their plan wouldn't work without Lord Nethys propping it up, but she is not quite that courageous yet.</p>

            <p>By way of distraction, he first wrote down memory-anchors for all his pending sex questions to submit to Carissa later while they're not in the middle of sex - this being, in dath ilan, a completely reasonable and well-known tactic to overcoming the distracting conversations that are the fundamental obstacle to sex.&nbsp; Plus, he needed to do that before they slipped his mind.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>The first thing he should do is reserve a condition for "my god can't communicate with me in this way".&nbsp; Arguendo:&nbsp; This could obviously be done by expending one spell slot to signal just 'this communication channel works at all', which spell's absence then means that nothing else worked.&nbsp; Counter-arguendo: that might be redundant if the other consistent states of the code seem sufficiently unlikely to arise by chance or optimization around other criteria, since the absence of a consistent code state would automatically imply channel failure; Keltham isn't going to pick some intricate code that makes full use of every possible bit of information in every spell choice, since that might not make it across the 'prayer' communication medium going the other direction.&nbsp; Counter-counter-arguendo:&nbsp; During initial establishment of this communications channel, probably a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of bits should be expended on error codes.&nbsp; Suppose for now that some very exotic spell gets picked to signal the condition 'this works as a communication channel at all', and its absence indicates failure of the whole scheme.</p>
            <p>Or maybe, if he gets a long enough spell list, he can have a choice of four otherwise unused spells, signaling:</p>
            <p>Question 1:&nbsp; Does this communications channel work?</p>
            <p>Spell 1.1:&nbsp; This communications channel should work fine.<br>Spell 1.2:&nbsp; This communications channel works at all, but may have errors.<br>Spell 1.3:&nbsp; This communications channel is very expensive.&nbsp; Use it very sparingly.<br>Spell 1.4:&nbsp; This communications channel is both expensive and error-prone.<br>1.(none of the above):&nbsp; Basic channel failure.</p>
            <p>Plus actually:</p>
            <p>Spell 1.5: &nbsp;Some element of the code you used is problematic. &nbsp;Try again with a different code.&nbsp; Other spells received should not be interpreted.</p>
            <p>And Keltham should not ask too many questions, on the rest of this first try, before he finds out whether cases 1.3/1.4 hold.</p>
            <p>What does he&nbsp;<em>really really</em> need to know?</p>
            <p>Question 2:&nbsp; What overall strategy is appropriate to his current situation?</p>
            <p>Spell 2.1:&nbsp; Take your current situation at face value and cooperate with the surrounding project.<br>Spell 2.2:&nbsp; Your current situation is not what it seems, use tomorrow's code for more info; but it's still good to go on doing research.<br>Spell 2.3:&nbsp; Exercise your supposed right to leave, as soon as you can use tomorrow's code to figure out where to go.&nbsp; Stall them on more valuable info in the meanwhile.<br>Spell 2.4:&nbsp; They wouldn't actually let you leave.&nbsp; Ask about escape or other options using tomorrow's code.&nbsp; Stall info.<br>Spell 2.5:&nbsp; You are in imminent danger.&nbsp; IMMEDIATELY ask to leave your current location and go somewhere else in Cheliax or a Lawful Neutral country if accessible, taking with only Carissa as a guide and not telling anyone else where you're going.<br>Spell 2.none:&nbsp; None of those are good ways of looking at it.</p>
            <p>Keltham has of course realized that there's variants of 2.5 which imply he shouldn't take Carissa with him either; but if the situation is that bad, they won't just let him leave; and if they won't just let him leave, he's going to need more communication to figure out what he should do instead.&nbsp; It's not like he can see any obvious escape plan as things stand.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Actually, now that Keltham thinks about it... he was planning to use a more elaborate code, and ask more questions besides those two; but maybe he shouldn't even be asking any more than this, on a first try at a channel.&nbsp; It might not support that much weight.</p>
            <p>Well, that does leave some room to potentially factor things, and maybe Keltham's own communications will be a bit clearer if he considers more branch points and fewer total leaves.</p>
            <p>Version two:<br><br></p>
            <p>Question 1: &nbsp;Does this communications channel work?</p>
            <p>Spell 1.1: &nbsp;This channel works.<br>Spell 1.none:&nbsp; Total channel failure.</p>
            <p>Question 2: &nbsp;Is this channel significantly expensive to Keltham's god?</p>
            <p>Spell 2.1: &nbsp;Yes.<br>Spell 2.2:&nbsp; A little expensive, use it only as needed.<br>Spell 2.3:&nbsp; Not at all, use it lots.<br>Spell 2.none:&nbsp; Wrong question / channel failure / this question wasn't worth answering.</p>
            <p>Question 3:&nbsp; Is this channel error-prone or noisy?</p>
            <p>Spell 3.1:&nbsp; No.<br>Spell 3.2:&nbsp; Yes, be careful.<br>Spell 3.3:&nbsp; It fails only negatively; you may miss a spell you should have got, but not receive one you shouldn't have received.<br>Spell 3.none:&nbsp; Wrong question / channel failure / not enough priority.</p>
            <p>Question 4:&nbsp; Could this channel handle more complex codes tomorrow?</p>
            <p>Spell 4.1:&nbsp; Yes.<br>Spell 4.none:&nbsp; No or not priority.</p>
            <p>Question 5:&nbsp; Should you be cooperating with your apparent coworkers, or stalling them on things that are really valuable/dangerous?</p>
            <p>Spell 5.1:&nbsp; Cooperate at least for tomorrow, inquire in more detail later.<br>Spell 5.2:&nbsp; Begin stalling, inquire in more detail later.</p>
            <p>This question is sufficiently important that 5.none is a good candidate for just signaling total comms failure, but redundancy.</p>
            <p>The other variations on v1's Question 2 don't actually imply any&nbsp;<em>immediate</em> change of policy besides stalling, except of course for:</p>
            <p>Question 6:&nbsp; <em>Imminent </em>danger at current location?</p>
            <p>Spell 6.1:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Flee with Carissa and tell nobody else where you're going.<br>Spell 6.none:&nbsp; Carrying out 6.1 wouldn't be a net improvement.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>...that's actually 11 total spells to take on signaling meaning, compared to version 1... okay, the fine detail in spell 3.3 is not something he needs to know literally during initial handshake, which cuts v.2 down to ten spells total, and makes it superior to v.1 because of the lower local branching, clearer meanings, and more critical meta-info being conveyed earlier.&nbsp; Besides eliminating Spell 3.3, are there other improvements to be made here?</p>
            <p>Actually, eliminating 2/8ths of the total code seems like the sort of thing that could easily cross some key threshold for feasibility on the first try, so if he cuts down on Q2...</p>

            <p>Question 1: &nbsp;Does this communications channel work?</p>
            <p>Spell 1.1: &nbsp;This channel works.<br>Spell 1.none: &nbsp;Total channel failure.</p>
            <p>Question 2: &nbsp;Is this channel significantly expensive to Keltham's god?</p>
            <p>Spell 2.1: &nbsp;Not at all, use it lots.<br>Spell 2.none:&nbsp; Yes / somewhat / wrong question / channel failure.</p>
            <p>Question 3: &nbsp;Is this channel error-prone or noisy?</p>
            <p>Spell 3.1: &nbsp;No.<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Spell 3.2: &nbsp;Yes, be careful.</span><br>Spell 3.none:&nbsp; Yes / wrong question / channel failure / not enough priority.</p>
            <p>Actually on further reflection, he doesn't really need 3.2 here either, since 3.none can safely convey that information mixed into a wider bucket.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Question 4: &nbsp;Could this channel handle more complex codes tomorrow?</span></p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Spell 4.1: &nbsp;Yes.</span><br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Spell 4.none: &nbsp;No or not priority.</span></p>
            <p>On yet further reflection, Keltham can just ask this question tomorrow, if he gets a 'no' on things being noisy.&nbsp; If 'yes' on things being noisy, but not expensive, he should construct a <em>redundant</em> code tomorrow instead of a complicated one.</p>
            <p>Question 4: &nbsp;Should you be cooperating with your apparent coworkers, or stalling them on things that are really valuable/dangerous?</p>
            <p>Spell 4.1: &nbsp;Cooperate at least for tomorrow, inquire in more detail later.<br>Spell 4.2: &nbsp;Begin stalling, inquire in more detail later.<br>Spell 4.none:&nbsp; Redundant signal of total channel failure.</p>
            <p>Question 5: &nbsp;Imminent danger at current location?</p>
            <p>Spell 5.1: &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Flee with Carissa and tell nobody else where you're going.<br>Spell 5.none: &nbsp;Carrying out 5.1 wouldn't be a net improvement and/or this channel element failed.</p>
            <p><br>Okay,&nbsp;<em>this</em> is a code Keltham can believe in, relative to his own level of design ability.&nbsp; It frontloads the most important meta-questions first, delays as many complications as possible beyond the fragile first attempt, and only requires him to keep five questions and six spell-meanings in mind to communicate across his own side of the 'prayer' channel.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Those spells, huh.&nbsp; Those sure are some spells.</p>
            <p>Aura Sight is on the list, but not Invisibility Purge; Glimpse of Beyond, but not Spell Immunity.&nbsp; If they'd had all the spells he knew about, but no new especially interesting ones, that would indicate that they were being first-order blatant about telling Ione what to include or exclude.&nbsp; If they'd omitted Aura Sight too, that might mean somebody didn't update Ione about the&nbsp;<em>new</em> list of what not to tell Keltham.&nbsp; This pattern indicates... either nothing much, or that they're able to do basic damn reflection about what Keltham is likely to think of things, and avoided there being any blatant pattern in the spell list so it would mean 'nothing much'.</p>
            <p>Anyways.&nbsp; He needs to pick his spell-request-pattern for tomorrow morning, and then sleep.&nbsp; There were probably other things he told himself to review today, but he is feeling a bit worn and not necessarily up for trying to remember what they all were. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll keep.</p>
            <p>Today he got four cantrips, six first-circle, four second-circle, three third-circle, two fourth-circle spells.&nbsp; Keltham should not assume his god can do that every time, so leave some headway at each level.</p>
            <p>He wants Guidance and Detect Magic among cantrips.&nbsp; If he had to pick spells on his own, he'd want at least one truth spell and at least one Comprehend Languages.&nbsp; Owl's Wisdom seems important to have in reserve for real emergencies, however dangerous it may be to dath ilani who didn't want to be Keepers, and you could say the same about Invisibility Purge.&nbsp; By default he's got the truth spell and Sanctuary to keep overnight, possibly cutting down expenses to his god some little bit.</p>
            <p>Are there any spells here that form useful mnemonic patterns with his questions and answers?&nbsp; Though he should maybe also try to pick spells that his god wouldn't try to urgently assign him for other reasons.&nbsp; And he needs to pick spells where he can see what they do, upon a cast, and without those spells harming the target.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Oh <em>huh</em>, Keltham thinks, as he starts poking through the list for something weird enough that there's no way his god would assign it unless the communications channel worked.</p>
            <p>Early Judgment: give someone a glimpse of their currently destined afterlife.</p>
            <p>Now there's a spell he wouldn't have expected Cheliax to show him if they were really trying to prevent him from figuring out his god, or for that matter, afterlives. &nbsp;Can he use that to see somebody <em>else's</em> destined afterlife too, and determine their real alignment even if they're not third-circle?&nbsp; That definitely goes on the list, not as a code, just as a default request -</p>
            <p>(At this point, Keltham's translation spell runs out, but somebody is timing things pretty well, and somebody arrives back to cast Share Language (Taldane) on him again.)</p>
            <p>Lay of the Land (2nd) grants instant knowledge of the surrounding lands; it sounds like an unambiguously interpretable spell to cast; and Keltham is unlikely to need it otherwise.&nbsp; Could be used to signal 'this worked at all' or to signal 'flee with Carissa'; semantically it's a better fit for the second.</p>
            <p>Stone Shape (3rd) - clearly interpretable, unlikely to be given otherwise.&nbsp; Mnemonically it could mean '4.1, show them how to make things'.&nbsp; At 3rd circle it's expensive, though.</p>
            <p>Create Food and Water (3rd again) - unmistakeable effect, mnemonically fits both '4.1 industrialize' and '5.1 flee'.&nbsp; He needs to look at cheaper spells though.</p>
            <p>Okay, Obscuring Mist (1st) has unmistakeable effect and would've been an obvious fit for 'this channel is noisy', but Keltham eliminated that answer-spell leaving only 'this channel is clear'... it also works for immediately fleeing with Carissa.&nbsp; Silly spells for silly adventurers, everything's going to look like it was designed for fleeing with Carissa.</p>
            <p>Air Bubble (1st)... <em>probably</em> not something his god would need to assign him otherwise, if he resolves not to do any chemistry experiments today, clearly visible effect, and it can stand for 'This channel is clear'.&nbsp; 3.1 or 1.1.</p>
            <p>Light... uses up a relatively precious cantrip slot, but it sure is unmistakeable.&nbsp; Another good fit for several different possible mnemonics.&nbsp; Hopefully not one his god would otherwise assign him.</p>
            <p>Create Water, likewise uses up a cantrip slot, but is unmistakeable and could mean 'this channel is cheap' because water is cheap.</p>
            <p>(Do they seriously mean <em>create water</em> and not just teleport it in, by the way?&nbsp; Because then why can't you also create very large amounts of energy?&nbsp; E^2 = P^2C^2 + M^2C^4 and all that.)</p>
            <p>Oh, Lighten Object (1st) would also do to convey that things weren't expensive.</p>
            <p>Share Language (2nd) would correspond very well to 'teach them' but it's also something a helpful, deaf god might assign if it thought that a student being able to hear a lecture in Baseline might be helpful to them.</p>
            <p>Silence (2nd) and Silent Table (2nd) are unmistakable and could mean some things.&nbsp; And Silent Table sounds less like it might be granted by a god that thought Keltham needed to flee.&nbsp; 2nd-circle is still expensive compared to 1st.</p>
            <p>Oh, and Read Weather is 1st and sounds unmistakeable and otherwise-improbable-to-get even if it doesn't <em>mean</em> much.&nbsp; At this point Keltham is ready to compromise on some meanings.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, attempted code, v1:</p>
            <p>1.1 Read Weather (1st):&nbsp; This channel works at all, and can tell you things, like the Weather.<br>2.1 Lighten Object (1st):&nbsp; This channel doesn't cost much.<br>3.1 Air Bubble (1st):&nbsp; This channel is clear.</p>
            <p>That uses up all his 1st slots if he keeps Sanctuary and a truth spell, and requests a new Comprehend Languages.&nbsp; Wait, didn't he want to keep one 1st-circle slot clear in case his god can't assign him six first-level spells every day?&nbsp; Well, it's probably a little safer if he's keeping some of his old spells... hopefully?&nbsp; He may not have better options.&nbsp; In 2nd, he already has a request for Early Judgment and emergency Owl's Wisdom, 4 slots total of which he should leave one free, and:</p>
            <p>5.1:&nbsp; Lay of the Land (2nd):&nbsp; Run.</p>
            <p>Okay, so instead of using expensive 3rds, what if on the topic of whether to speak freely or stall:</p>
            <p>4.1:&nbsp; Light (0th):&nbsp; Shed light on their ignorance.<br>4.2:&nbsp; Create Water (0th):&nbsp; Stall with a great volume of cheap stuff.</p>
            <p>Those are alternates, so they only use up one cantrip slot, leaving the other two free for Guidance and Detect Magic, and the fourth for his god's choice, or empty because his god strained itself to give him so many spells before.</p>
            <p>And then when it comes to 3rd and 4th... he could mostly leave that up to his god, but if his god wants any suggestions, Keltham will go on Invisibility Purge for 3rd and... he doesn't really have much he&nbsp;<em>wants</em> in 4th.&nbsp; Well, he could ask for Tongues and use that to free up the valuable 1st-level slot occupied by Comprehend Languages.&nbsp; Actually, can clerics request lower-level spells in higher spell 'slots'?&nbsp; That would make his life noticeably simpler in this regard and save his god money.&nbsp; Keltham should have asked this question earlier.</p>

            <p>- and to survive the next hour! Let's do that one first! It's a test, obviously it's a test, but there are all kinds of things one tests for. Loyalty, the willingness to say 'I serve my Queen' even when it's a losing move in the moment. Theological purity, going through the right mental motions on your way to the truth. Strategic competence, where one gets to contemplate considerations like how, if this is real, immediately angering the powerful stranger is a poor path to protecting the Queen or the country.&nbsp;</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa does not understand Aspexia Rugatonn, but she's met her, and so she has a fraction more context with which to reject this than she would have had yesterday, when she would have rejected it on general principle. You do not serve a god by giving his interventions unexpected effects.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So that's the question answered, but not the strategic situation at all resolved; only in tests for five year olds do you win by defiantly screaming the truth for all the world to hear. And the Church and Queen do diverge, sometimes, Maillol's story about the slave implied it, and it's possible this is a test from a different angle than Aspexia Rugatonn's. The first priority is to survive it, then to report it, then to seek correction in any mistaken details of her understanding of precisely why you do not overthrow the Queen of Cheliax.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"I presume myself to understand nothing about the Queen, or her House, or any matters in which I have not been directed," she says. "But I <em>was</em> directed that, if I serve Asmodeus in this world, I will be raised high in it, and so I will listen to your explanation; I assume you have more of one."</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>How could she&nbsp;<em>possibly&nbsp;</em>win this. She hasn't prepared her spells yet. - she isn't sure if she'll get enough sleep tonight, to prepare her spells. One should of course die for their country as needed, but if there's a plot against the Queen it is better to live to report it. She can try talking her way into getting more time unsupervised, but that kind of Splendour usually comes with excellent interpersonal reading and she shouldn't count on it. Can she cancel the candle. Quietly trigger a ward.&nbsp;</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Disrupting the candle seems doable but if the woman's smart the candle will have nothing to do with whatever protections might hide this conversation from security. She didn't even claim it did, just, 'while this candle burns', and while you're not supposed to give in to the temptation to speak to adversaries in beautiful technical-truths like that when a simple lie would do it's still information.</p>
            <p>"Well, see, I don't know how I'd like having a county; and it was pointed out to me that if it had been the will of Asmodeus that I have one He could have ordered it." And it feels like there's an incoherence, in the claim that Asmodeus wants a slave and not one who made a pact with Him to serve their own interests, and in claiming that Carissa's own interests point her towards power, but confusions there don't matter very much because there's already no way that the Church desires this and her top priority now isn't parsing out precisely why not. "And the throne, as you note, seems to burn one up sooner or later, besides which it feels implausible you'd go to all this trouble to put someone else on it."</p>

            <p>Sure, fine, she'll do the five year old thing; she doesn't, actually, see how to do better, and it's a way to keep talking. "They teach different shards of Asmodeanism, I think, to nobles. I haven't learned them. I don't know how the Queen justifies herself, or if she needs to; perhaps she acted only directed by the advisors Asmodeus sent her, more loyal and obedient than she cares to have anyone guess. But I know what's going on <em>here</em>. A lot is going on here, and it's very important; more important to Asmodeus, I think, than how mortals He owns conceive of their loyalty to Him, even mortals who are the Queen. He intervened<em> here, </em>so that our pathetic inadequate efforts to represent Him and our country here might stand a chance of success they otherwise wouldn't. I'm supposed to be here. And if I invent a way to correct the flaws in human nature and make us His worthy servants, then perhaps I'll get some titles out of that, as it pleases the Queen, but if I merely learn for Cheliax how the exact same bit of metal is manufactured three thousand times over to a precision so high they will&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>interlock then I will still have wisely spent the resources that Crown and Church have allocated here. And I would have to be an&nbsp;<em>idiot&nbsp;</em>to risk&nbsp;<em>any of that&nbsp;</em>to correct some flaw in Cheliax that is in the&nbsp;<em>slightest&nbsp;</em>less time sensitive.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>The obvious reflexive 'no' would not be useful information, to the genuine Queen of Cheliax; the thought process might be, but she'll have to let it play out, and she doesn't actually know its exact contents until it plays out, which -</p>
            <p>- it would be so irritating, to mostly have peoples' minds full of thoughts about whether you're going to kill them. Carissa will strive to avoid that. The other obvious not-reassuring answer is that this is not guidance Aspexia Rugatonn would give -</p>
            <p>- because Asmodeus doesn't overthrow Pharasma -</p>
            <p>- because even if you wanted the Queen of Cheliax taken out you would not involve any third circle wizards in your plans, they are weak enough to actively be far more of a liability than an aid -</p>
            <p>- because Asmodeus's directions to Carissa are narrow, and Aspexia Rugatonn wants to interpret them narrowly, do the obvious things and not other things that cloud Asmodeus's vision with noise and confusion -</p>
            <p>- but it is true that Chelish monarchs get assassinated a lot, presumably with the Church's implicit support, so maybe Carissa is the one misunderstanding, believing that Asmodeanism does actually say you shouldn't murder your Queen.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- some part of Carissa's brain chimes up that she shouldn't murder the Queen because the Queen is really pretty. Thank you that part of Carissa's brain for reminding her that humans are fundamentally contemptible beings.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- Carissa notes that the only people ever to have been acknowledged as killing a King or Queen of Cheliax is another of House Thrune, presumably because for everyone else Asmodeus's law does apply and does ban regicide and if you succeed they still put you to death, they don't make you a deal. That might even be part of the pact, that House Thrune can play among themselves but needn't fear their entire country made weapons pointed at them, needn't fear the chaos of being Taldor or of the civil wars before Hell rose to power in Cheliax -</p>
            <p>- there are rules here and she doesn't know them -</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"Not the new playmate I'd hoped for, not the potential inconvenience I thought worth a personal visit.&nbsp; Understand, Sevar, I will not lightly break one of my senior partner's toys, but if I need do so, I will petrify you, ward the statue against detection, and bury your trapped soul deep enough that ages would not expose it again.&nbsp; Perhaps in time Asmodeus will see you in His embrace at last, or perhaps some little inconvenience will end all Pharasma's works before then, for all Otolmens's pains."</p>
            <p>"Ferrer Maillol is a competent administrator, as Asmodean priests go, but he lacks vision."&nbsp; Abrogail's voice is not at all seductive, now, it commands, <em>demands.</em>&nbsp; "We are <em>not</em> satisfied with Cheliax being taught the outsider's secrets of metalworking.&nbsp; We do not expect Lord Asmodeus will be satisfied with it either.&nbsp; Not if <em>other</em> countries also come to possess those secrets.&nbsp; We desire that Cheliax gain <em>advantage</em> from this, Carissa Sevar.&nbsp; Why our Lord has instructed that we do not simply keep the outsider for our own, I do not know for certain, but it is not an instruction I intend to defy."</p>
            <p>"This being so, we <em>particularly</em> desire that Cheliax not be left in an unfortunate position by an outsider propagating a powerful Lawful Neutral philosophy which enables its masters to unravel secrets of the magicless and perhaps the magical world; but which, introduced to Chelish students, inevitably casts them into heresy, so that only priests and the soul-sold slaves of Asmodeus can safely be taught it.&nbsp; We do not have enough of those to compete with Osirion and Lastwall if <em>all </em>their wizards and clerics and tinkerers are being taught those new ways.&nbsp; If the outsider teaches widely elsewhere it will be a trivial matter to steal his teachings, but we must be able to <em>use</em>&nbsp;what we copy."</p>
            <p>"Maillol's previous instructions to you are <em>revoked.</em>&nbsp; His understanding of Asmodeus's will <em>failed.</em>&nbsp; You have <em>no</em> priority higher than learning the core source of power of Keltham's world, and transforming it into a form that Asmodean students can learn and remain Asmodeans.&nbsp; Better yet, burn and refine their iron to <em>steel</em><em>,</em> show what their philosophy can become when it embraces power and <em>pain</em>, and wield that to raise a force that could crush dath ilan under our heel.&nbsp; Do that, and <em>I,</em> as Asmodeus's designate here, will say that you served Him well, and raise you high within this world."</p>

            <p>All right.&nbsp; Let's do this.</p>
            <p>Keltham reviews his notes from the previous night, written appropriately cryptically, and then prays, trying to cast his mind Beyond, maybe in the direction that wasn't the three space or one time, looking toward his deity: the Lawful Neutral god of people wanting to follow the protocols they must follow in order for their interactions to be mutually beneficial, come to the Pareto frontier, coordinate without vast enforcement costs, summing to powerful societies and markets even when people largely pursue their own individual interests individually, because they never step on others in order to do that.</p>
            <p>Requests, obviously subject to amendation should his unknown god deem there to be better spells he could get:</p>
            <p>0th:&nbsp; Detect Magic, Guidance<br>1st:&nbsp; Comprehend Languages, Truthspell, keep Sanctuary<br>2nd:&nbsp; Owl's Wisdom, Early Judgment<br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3rd:&nbsp; Invisibility Purge</span> actually, how about his god only reassigns him Invisibility Purge, or Glimpse of Beyond, if Keltham <em>still</em> might need it<br>3rd:&nbsp; Owl's Wisdom, actually Honest Pricing also seems good here<br>4th:&nbsp; Early Judgment</p>
            <p>And&nbsp;<em>also:</em></p>
            <p>If conditional spell assignment works at all for communication with his god, please assign Read Weather (1st).<br>If the communication doesn't cost much, please assign Lighten Object (1st).<br>If the communication seems like it should be error-free and reliable, please assign Air Bubble (1st).<br>If Keltham should speak freely and teach as much as he can to his hosts, please assign Light (0th).<br>If Keltham should instead stall them with relatively less dangerous material, please assign Create Water (0th).<br>And if Keltham should run the ass out of here today with just Carissa and tell nobody else where he's going, please assign Lay of the Land (2nd).</p>
            <p>Any remaining slots should be assigned as his god sees fit.</p>
            <p>...Keltham would also like to talk, if now is a better time than yesterday, for whatever reason.&nbsp; Keltham has many questions about how he can best cooperate in a mutually beneficial way with his god.</p>

It seems to Abadar that the mortal wants a nice rich stable world, and is more likely to endanger it if he ends up getting the wrong subset of information about the world, like might happen if you are Asmodeus and maliciously lying to advance your own interests. It seems to Abadar that containing the mortal by trying to learn his dangerous secrets while concealing Asmodeus's own dangerous secrets is an obviously doomed plan and it's absurd for Otolmens to countenance that and not countenance Abadar telling the mortal a small set of true non-inflammatory things such as 'Cheliax is lying to you' and 'my country has preexisting contractual arrangements for similar situations and will respect your intellectual property'.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>What are Sevar's&nbsp;<em>actual</em> heresies?&nbsp; Maillol can't easily count them.</p>
            <p>Most centrally, Sevar believes that Asmodeanism is about making everyone ultimately better off, which is <em>the</em> central example of propaganda that gets fed to the Outers and that the Inners know better than to believe.&nbsp; Lots of Outers know better on some level, they just know that they'll die if they say it out loud or even if their thoughts are too honest about it, producing a kind of pseudo-belief that shreds apart words from wordless knowledge; an inner disintegrity that is then useful for many further ends in molding people, and probably aesthetically pleasing to Asmodeus as well, though it's hard to be sure with gods.</p>
            <p>Maillol does not think the time has come to drop that particular enlightenment on Sevar.&nbsp; She has had too little taste of privilege and power, she is too close emotionally to Lawful Neutrality and too exposed to Keltham's contrary examples.</p>
            <p>Sevar thinks that Cheliax's tyranny is painful in part because the pain is educational and necessary and ultimately beneficial to the people being punished.&nbsp; She thinks Hell is painful in part because that pain is necessary to produce the useful and refined beings that Asmodeus desires as tools.</p>
            <p>Maillol is not sure when, if ever, she'll be ready to hear that the cruelty is the point.&nbsp; You get told that either after you've sold your soul, or after Asmodeus has chosen you as a cleric.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Maillol doesn't think he should just refuse to answer either.</p>
            <p>"Sexually, you seem to have acquired the idea that it would be right for Keltham to do as he wished with you, once you gave yourself to him.&nbsp; On conventional Asmodeanism, one would say that it is right for Keltham to do as he wishes with you because he has the power to get away with it within a lawful system that offers you no defense.&nbsp; Keltham could come by that power because the Church told you to be obedient, because Asmodeus and his greater slaves like myself gave you to him to do with as he pleases, or because some girl was born into slavery to her slave parents and Keltham bought her and decided to enjoy strangling her in bed."</p>
            <p>"Don't misunderstand this as critique of the strategy you ended up executing, Sevar.&nbsp; Telling him that it was okay because you consented was an excellent move.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wouldn't have gone for it otherwise and he's just starting out with his first tentative steps away from his Lawful Good society."</p>
            <p>"But the fact that you <em>believe </em>what you told Keltham seems to have more to do with certain bizarre personal hangups of yours about events in countries that aren't even Cheliax.&nbsp; Right now, Sevar, the number one person most likely to drag <em>you</em> off to a bedroom and do as they will with you, is the Queen of Cheliax, who is not, to the best of my knowledge, male, and has no doubt killed <em>any</em> number of men after making good use of them.&nbsp; Whether any of them consented is&nbsp;<em>utterly</em> irrelevant to her soul's standing with Asmodeus.&nbsp; She's the Queen of Cheliax.&nbsp; There's no recourse from her, no appeal, no court, she doesn't just have the <em>power</em> to do what she wants with you, she has the <em>legal right,</em> which is the difference between Evil and Lawful Evil.&nbsp; Then for her to take what she wants from you, if she happens to want it, is the most natural and Asmodean thing in the world."</p>
            <p>"That you think it's more Asmodean from the&nbsp;<em>Queen's</em> perspective, if you happen to have consented, if you happen to have given yourself to her, is the heretical part.&nbsp; Maybe it's more Asmodean for&nbsp;<em>you</em> if you become a willing slave to the one who hurts you, a shadow of how it will be in Hell.&nbsp; It is <em>not</em> more Asmodean for the Queen to think that it becomes more right if she has your consent.&nbsp; That will not be what Asmodeus is thinking when you come to Him in Hell."</p>
            <p>"The obvious endgame on seducing Keltham would be to lure him deeper into sadism and domination with this talk about consent, and then lure him further to the point where he feels that he has the right to make use of somebody who hasn't consented to him at all, and does that.&nbsp; That will be the point that he starts to detect as Lawful Evil and be bound for our Lord's Hell."</p>
            <p>"And Sevar.&nbsp; This is not a male-versus-female thing.&nbsp; Asmodeus really, really doesn't give two shits about that.&nbsp; You've met our Queen.&nbsp; You should already know better."</p>

            <p>"If you're looking for somewhere to open the Queen's gift, Sevar, try the torture chamber on the right; there's no torturer currently on duty there and the junior priest stationed outside has healing spells.&nbsp; Though doing that right away may come at the expense of being able to prepare spells before you're scheduled to brief the other girls in the morning, depending on how elaborate the Queen's gift turns out to be."</p>
            <p>"It's also been suggested to me that you, Sevar, had to buy your own intelligence headband because requisitions was being weirdly obstructionist about it and gave you a two-week delivery time.&nbsp; The one you purchased will, on this version, arrive with the next delivery we get, later today.&nbsp; You say that where the girls and Keltham can hear.&nbsp; Then somebody, possibly Ione, should mention to Keltham the wild but unlikely theory that the delay is because they're planning to prepare cursed intelligence headbands, which exist just like cursed versions of most other magic items exist, and in particular have been famously known to do subtle influences and mind control and even make people dumber on certain subjects without realizing it.&nbsp; It's not impossible that they had at least one cursed headband lying around to substitute for the one you bought, to slip it to you immediately.&nbsp; The point being that Keltham shouldn't just ask to borrow your headband from you, though that's in any case something that wizards tend to be really fucking insane about."</p>
            <p>"Those are lies to Keltham, though," except for that very last part, "so your final call.&nbsp; The suggester wasn't in our chain of command."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>She's felt it before, of course, she has Fox's Cunning and uses it sometimes when she's stuck on a spell structure, or on how to get an enchantment to lay nicely. It's wonderful, it feels like the difference between being groggily half-awake and being properly awake except on top of awakeness. It feels like the sort of conversation you have with another person where each of you sees exactly where the other is going so you get three words into a sentence and the other person says eagerly 'yes' and you can move on to the next piece, having placed a conceptual pointer, except with just one person.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Right now it's mostly just making it harder to refocus her attention away from the Queen's threat to petrify her. Which is silly. The threat made sense: Carissa is glad to live in a country where Queens issue such threats, because contemplating their overthrow really is a very grave crime and if there were no penalty more serious than more quickly meeting Asmodeus then more people would do it, and that wouldn't do. Carissa understood this incentive problem to mostly be solved with a very, very protracted death but she can appreciate why the Queen would have assessed Carissa's own incentives as being different. And very simple.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And she's not going to overthrow the Queen, because she isn't an idiot, so it's fine. Except that it seems like there are actually a lot of ways that Carissa could fail, from here, in ways that made people very angry at her, and -</p>
            <p>- it's always been true that she'll go to Hell&nbsp;<em>no matter what.</em></p>
            <p>- digression, why does Maillol think that the Queen might want to have sex with her? Why would the Queen want that? Should Carissa want the Queen to want that? She leans no, because being around the Queen more feels like it makes it more likely one ends up a statue underground. Maybe if she has succeeded tremendously at her project and built dath ilan but evil and better. If that happens probably she will not end up a statue underground.</p>
            <p>(The Queen could be bluffing. Asmodeus has chosen Carissa, perhaps He wouldn't tolerate that. There was no hint of it in her voice or manner but then, there wouldn't be.)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Okay, setting that aside with more mental effort than it ought to take but not more than she has on hand.</p>
            <p>The Queen implied that Asmodeus instructed Cheliax to let Keltham go, when he leaves. Which makes sense of why Contessa Lrilatha was willing to concede that in contract negotiations; it was commanded already. Why did Asmodeus give those instructions? The Queen's right, that Keltham isn't a relative advantage for Cheliax at all if no one can learn his teachings without ending up a heretic. That seems really important to understand. She's not coming up with anything but it's standing out now in her memory as a question, along with 'why isn't Abadar talking to Keltham' and 'is Otolmens right to think Keltham might end the world' <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and 'how badly do I have to screw up to get turned into a statue</span>' -</p>
            <p>Queen's present before she gives the Taldor briefing, or after? &nbsp;....Carissa kind of wants to be in a lot of pain right now, so that settles that.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"Thank you," she says perfunctorily to Maillol, and goes off to the torture chamber.</p>

            <p>Carissa has been in torture chambers before, on both sides of the restraints.&nbsp; This one is much smaller than the one you'd find in a larger temple, with stations for only two prisoners and one torturer; and it's fancier and better-decorated with glaring crimson mood lighting, because it's in the temple built into the private summer villa of an archduke.&nbsp; But aside from that, it looks like a very ordinary and conventional torture chamber in an Asmodean temple.</p>
            <p>The bag is quite small, even for a Holding bag.&nbsp; You could fit your hand into how large it appears to be, if you tried, though the Queen did say it triggered just on being opened, and not with sticking your hand in.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Carissa spends a couple of minutes on the floor trembling and sobbing and restraining herself from vomiting. That's without looking at her hand, which she's pretty sure will set her off again.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Well. She's not going to worry anymore about pushing Keltham into being more intense than she can't handle. She is not sure if that's what the Queen was aiming at or if she just thinks it's funny.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She's pretty sure that asking for the bag to be recharged so she can do it again would be flirting with the Queen, which she should not do. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">But who turns down a challenge from the Queen of Cheliax to prove yourself intense enough</span>&nbsp;She will definitely regret that. Down that path lies statues, which is a different kind of thought than 'down that path lies horrible pain'. Down her own path lies horrible pain. She knows that. She should expect many days in Hell that are like that, even if she's a very promising student, because there are things you can only learn that way. She...genuinely doesn't think it's the fact that that was the most AWFUL FIVE MINUTES OF HER LIFE - or however long it was - is the reason she's not asking to do it again.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When the pain and nausea have subsided enough she can breathe evenly she looks at her hand.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Taldor has been around for nearly a thousand years, and has a civil war with brutal regularity at nearly every succession, because the next Emperor is appointed, technically by the Senate, a vestigial body in the capital with no real influence except once every few decades when it is called upon to name the next Emperor. The processes the Senate is supposed to follow are stunningly opaque and complex -- the word in Carissa's language for 'excessively complicated' stems from the capital city of Taldor -- and there's no mechanism by which the Senate's rulings are enforced, besides that they lend the named person a lot of credibility. Needless to say, that doesn't really work, and peaceful successions are at this point practically the exception; unfit or young Emperors have a tendency to be elevated only to swiftly die of it, ruthless outsiders sometimes have a go until they misstep in the capital politics they don't understand and die, the army is always cheerfully threatening to proclaim a general as emperor....</p>
            <p>Emperors tried in various ways to secure a preferred successor -- naming a co-emperor, say -- but it was common for junior co-emperors to be killed when their senior co-emperor died or lost his foothold.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Taldor is mostly feudal, but the Emperor appoints the rulers of some provinces directly, and those military governors are supposed to be especially loyal to him and his enforcers, if a fight is necessary. Of course, if you let your military governors accumulate too much power in their own right they might overthrow you. Of course, if you keep the people who concern you most close to home they might assassinate you.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Despite all this Taldor has remained a major global power, mostly for two reasons: firstly, even its outlying fortresses are a thousand years old and nearly unassailable (including by one another, during civil wars), and secondly, Oppara itself is a magnificently walled and warded city, and it's said those walls will outlast the world. It's lost some ground to Qadira, and some to Galt, but it's still larger than Cheliax.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>"All right. First, on settling sadism bets, the answer is yes. Also do not propose a bet with Keltham because dath ilan has a deeply bizarre norm that the thing you bet during sex is nonreciprocal services, which would otherwise, naturally, not be a thing because anything anyone does they should get something in return for. Yes, he thinks that still applies here where he has knowledge any government would slaughter cities for. Yes, I think it's plausibly worth trying to convince him that Evil has more fun, but you've got to be careful about it. I'll give much more specific instruction to anyone who seems to be getting close to him but the essential bits are - you want to be here, it's ridiculous that anyone would threaten or coerce you into being here if you didn't want to be, you might be exceedingly transactional about your intentions towards Keltham but it's your transaction that you expect to enrich you. You can, if you'd like, have one mean boyfriend who didn't treat you like that in your backstory, especially if you've got hangups to explain, but coordinate with me so you don't all do it. I do not want people who are inexperienced with pain in bed, or sexually inexperienced generally, trying to let Keltham hit you; we're working with a narrative where some people really like that, and most pain here or in Hell is because some people really like that, and if you've obviously managed to talk yourself into it that has decent odds of coming out.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You are going to not lie to him about anything that's not essential. I get transcripts, I will light you on fire, you will be grateful I did because otherwise my boss would have to do it and he has a longer attention span for it. The key thing here is that Keltham notices different features of the world than us so we don't, actually, know all that much about how to lie convincingly to him. So the less you force us to fit into the lie, the easier our lives are. Say 'I don't feel ready to talk about it', say 'I should have learned that in class but it was the week my sister died so I wasn't paying attention', say 'I'm having a hard time putting it into words', say 'can I recommend you a book? I forget all the details myself'. You all want to show off by being competent, but we will get more out of Keltham if we are weak, flawed, confused, and therefore wouldn't be expected to have good answers to all of his questions. He already thinks everyone in this world doesn't know how to think. If you can't think of a<em> true</em> thing to say, or an <em>approved in-story&nbsp;</em>thing to say,&nbsp;the thing to do is to let him believe that even harder.&nbsp;</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"We're going to delay it as long as we can because outmaneuvering smarter Keltham's going to be even harder, maybe impossible. Officially, Acquisitions said it'll be two weeks and I went ahead and ordered one myself, which I can afford to do and you can't because I've been earning a generous salary from Cheliax for my work at the Worldwound for six years and you haven't. The gossip is that this is because, you know, some intelligence headbands are cursed, and even worse some are just a tiny bit cursed, make you see things in a particular light, and optimistically Acquisitions is making really sure the project headbands are good and pessimistically, well, they could be manufacturing them a little cursed. Please attempt to have a little bit of subtlety in causing this gossip to reach Keltham's ears. I actually suspect that only the 'optimistically' part needs to be said and he is competent to fill in the rest.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Also we are going to be hiding a lot behind you guys not actually being all that well-educated, not actually knowing that much history or politics or economics, because magical education in Cheliax is very specialized. The smarter you are the harder it is for you to make innocent mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Keltham is under the impression you were screened for willingness to bear his children; I think that's just true, but if it's not, you now explicitly have permission to lie about it. Keltham is under the impression you are getting generously paid; I think&nbsp;<em>that's&nbsp;</em>just true, because I have told everyone that we're doing as few lies as possible, but if it's not, you have permission to truthfully say 'I was told we would be generously paid and if the money isn't there I'm going to go to whoever's in charge here and make a nuisance of myself' and then to come to me, and maybe to lie after that depending what's up. Keltham is under the impression that if you didn't want to sleep with him, no one would make you; you have permission to lie to him about that, but also, if you find yourself getting cold feet in bed, you won't actually be punished for telling Keltham 'wait, I think actually I'm not ready and I just want to cuddle', because that presently advances our goals. That said, if Keltham<em> ignores</em> you about that, that would be great news for the project and you should make sure he has a really pleasant time about it and ends up with the impression he was right to ignore you. I strongly expect that if you try to tease him by getting him really turned on and then saying 'no' he'll just give you a hug and say it's okay, so if you are trying this route you're going to have to try something a lot subtler and cleverer than that, and you should run it by me.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We aren't telling him about the soul arrangements, but if he somehow learns of it, the line is that it's normal for people in dangerous lines of work to arrange their afterlife in advance so they don't end up in Avernus in general processing, and that as a bonus these business arrangements are hotly competed for among devils so a good negotiator can get some reasonably powerful magic out of making their afterlife arrangements. But that's only if he somehow finds out. I, and some of your colleagues, don't have arcane sight, because our contractual arrangements were a bit different; we're still working out the best story for that so for today you should conceal having it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Other things you are explicitly expected to lie to Keltham about: who his god is. It's going to be an obscure Tian one. Whether all fourth-circle clerics have a weaker personal aura should they differ from their god in alignment; it doesn't come up much in Cheliax because it can't happen with an Asmodean cleric but you'd expect they wouldn't. Whether Cheliax is systematically concealing things. Whether Hell involves involuntary torture.</p>
            <p>And, of course, everything to do with the character of Cheliax as a nation. We're going to be pretending that Cheliax is Taldor."<br><br>And she explains her reasoning, again, and explains the key outlines from the fake timeline and from the books about Taldor.&nbsp;<br><br>"At this time I'll take questions, but my plan is actually for you to spend the rest of the morning learning enough about Taldor that you can be a magic-tracked shut-in who plausibly lived there."</p>

But I do think he'll notice if we're running the plot of a romance novel on him, it's too - you wouldn't expect to run across those people&nbsp;<em>in that order</em> unless something was up. And unless you're very good at faking sexual reactions he'll notice what you're actually into, dath ilan does train that skill. Also Keltham has in common with paladins that<em> in real life </em>the biggest barrier to seducing them is them endlessly going 'I don't want to risk you having a child I couldn't take proper responsibility for'. I think there's no point trying to convince Keltham that that's Good, I get the sense dath ilan has lots of children-related taboos which we should mostly just try to steer very far clear of. -relatedly, you're not allowed to point out to him that he could use magic to make you have an abortion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That said if anyone <em>does</em>&nbsp;have a convenient fetish for being forced that seems valuable. And once he's had some time to adjust we might be able to work with having threesomes where one girl forces the other and if Keltham objects both of them are like 'we're having a great time here????'."</p>
