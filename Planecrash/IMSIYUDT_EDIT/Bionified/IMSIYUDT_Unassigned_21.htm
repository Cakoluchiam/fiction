            <p>That hypothesis makes this more valuable to you as a test of his tropes theory though you understand why he wouldn't see it that way. You have lots of observations about how incredibly implausible it'd be for the Queen to steal Carissa, but you aren't sure how they hold up in tropeworld. In the actual, logical world, though, incredibly unlikely.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Also, though he has good reason to put this line of thought on hold, the Queen would absolutely respect a preexisting arrangement, even if things are running on...tropes...she couldn't be the Queen of Cheliax if she broke a preexisting agreement between Keltham and Cheliax over Carissa, such as that she is his.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"It's not that she can't, but that she won't" is unfortunately <em>exactly the wrong </em>literal phrasing to use, if you were hoping to <em>not</em> remind Abrogail Thrune that she is now the Queen of Cheliax, her mother is safely dead, the tutoress who said those things to her and backed them up with a whip was turned into a statue, eventually, and that the point of being Abrogail Thrune is that literally nobody gets to tell you what to do.&nbsp; She has a junior partnership with her senior partner Asmodeus, and keeps to her side of that bargain, and that's it.</p>
            <p><br>...but is it actually any <em>more </em>proof of her freedom, if she lets a 'trope' manifest through her, instead?</p>
            <p>...though, according to Sevar, it's more that Keltham just happened to land in a universe where the Queen will do what the 'trope' wants, and now at this point Abrogail is genuinely confused about who and what she's supposed to say 'fuck you' to.<br><br></p>
            <p>"But, to be clear," Isidre says cautiously, "<em>if </em>the Queen chooses of her own will not to cause a complication, then the result is that we've proven tropes don't govern here.&nbsp; That's the only result, correct?&nbsp; It's not that our head of government blinks out of existence or is subjected to a godlike level of mind control."</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Her sincere honest answer is that Keltham is more - something, the phrase she immediately thought of is 'terrifyingly creative' but she's 100% sure she will regret with great intensity having questioned the Queen of Cheliax's terrifying creativity - more dath ilani, the space of solutions he draws from is larger and once he gets competent he'll be able to use the Golarion pool too - he clearly thought he had a way of doing safe Wishes that might work and she can't even tell him he's obviously wrong -</p>
            <p>- anyway, he's more <em>something </em>than the Queen of Cheliax and the Queen of Cheliax would beat him without trying in a ruthlessness contest or a solving your problems with any of murder petrification and mind control contest, but Asmodeus has committed to letting Keltham leave Cheliax alive and in one piece, and given that she thinks Keltham would win this contest, if both of them were trying. And also it's obviously not in Cheliax's interests to let it come to that, though it's maybe in Cheliax's interests to make Keltham realize that he does, actually, want to be the person who would have absolute power over Carissa even if he doesn't quite yet want to exercise it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>"She's more of a Good person than I am, by the sound of things, or Carissa thought she might not be that Good, but her advisors certainly sound Good-leaning.&nbsp; All 'the good of Cheliax requires that you have no fun' and that.&nbsp; The Church of Asmodeus yoinks her political capital if she actually tries to take Sevar; I can say I'll walk out on Cheliax if I lose Sevar to her and mean that, because I'm less Good than she is and have fewer existing bargains I'm constrained by."</p>
            <p>"I'd expect Carissa's sexuality to accept that coin, if it's a reasonable and logical sort of sexuality.&nbsp; The question of who is more&nbsp;<em>willing</em> to use their power is very much the determinant of who&nbsp;<em>actually</em> would end up with absolute-power over her - who it is that, if they so chose, Carissa could not escape from."</p>

And that - caring that much about me - is indeed something the Queen can't compete with, and the key to Carissa's sexuality, or as close to it as a person who still runs into a wall of Good every time he tries to have desires can comprehend it.</p>

            <p>Well.&nbsp; It's clear enough that Sevar thinks that Keltham has already won this contest, and with it her heart; so the question then becomes, does Abrogail Thrune choose to permit Sevar to go on believing that, and to convince Keltham of it too.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"That Carissa's sexuality depends on the <em>truth</em> of two propositions that can't both simultaneously be true is, itself, very much a 'trope', and one of the deepest and most powerful ones.&nbsp; Even more than the Queen of Cheliax being a <em>complication</em>, even more than her coming into <em>conflict </em>with me, the deepest 'trope' here has to be the <em>question-of-fact</em>, what is really true.&nbsp; Everything else fell into place once I realized that."</p>
            <p>"My proposal is as simple as it is unfair to the Queen.&nbsp; If I meet her and know her and think she's worthy of Carissa at all, I offer to negotiate the rental agreement for Carissa.&nbsp; In front of her advisors.&nbsp; And with Carissa there to see it, because she's the one who has to know this truth and witness it.&nbsp; I say plainly" (a dath ilani does not bother to add 'and truthfully' if they're bothering to let words leave their mouth at all) "that I'm worried about a more experienced sadist stealing Carissa from me, and if the Queen of Cheliax does that successfully, I will walk out on Cheliax and go make a revolution somewhere else.&nbsp; I say that I want guarantees about my right, signed by the government of Cheliax and by the Queen and by the Church of Asmodeus in whatever capacity Asmodeus recognizes such things, to take Carissa with me if that happens, potentially including against her own will, if I so choose, to somewhere that puts enough value on a dath ilani to also recognize my possession of her."</p>
            <p>"Having that right doesn't mean I'd actually exercise it, obviously, but nobody needs to say that in front of the Queen; and while Carissa might know what I wouldn't really do, I think she'll also understand the romantic gesture in the spirit in which it was intended."</p>
            <p>"If everybody's being sane, the Queen and her advisors are like, sure, sounds weirdly extreme but he's obviously doing it to impress his girlfriend, they sign on like the totally sane grownups they are.&nbsp; The limits on the Queen's sadism are in a sealed section of the compact that I trust you to write.&nbsp; The conflict <em>and the 'trope'</em> have been defused, easily enough to call into severe question whether there was ever really any 'trope' at work in the first place."</p>
            <p>"If the Queen is like, why, no, how could I possibly do <em>that</em>, I have strange reasons I cannot do <em>that</em>, then we know she's a giant 'trope' avatar and there's a foretold path of conflict and complication whose core question-of-truth is who Carissa Sevar really belongs to - both de facto and in terms of her core sexuality, because those two are the same thing."</p>
            <p>"In which case, obviously, I stop negotiating that rental agreement, get back to my new research installation, and both we and the Queen's advisers do everything we can to keep the Queen and Carissa apart for as long as possible.&nbsp; We do everything we can to, like, totally slow down all of that from actually happening, if that is at <em>all</em> possible, and try to delay everything into the future as far as possible, because, like, I already have a job."</p>
            <p>"Eventually either the Queen loses power, or the two of us reconcile and kiss, or, if I screw up along the way, the Queen wins and Cheliax stays poor for longer.&nbsp; Or Golarion ends up falling to the Worldwound because there wasn't really anywhere else that could offer the resources that Cheliax and Asmodeus could.&nbsp; I suppose there's other possibilities within the 'tropes' that would then almost have to be governing, but I'd have to think hard about what they were; they'd be less probable."</p>

            <p>It seems possible that Carissa having feelings for Keltham is actually relevant as a qualification to pull this off. Because Carissa, unlike literally every other person in this operation,<em> doesn't underestimate him.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <p>She doesn't know which specific thoughts in the last little bit have merited punishment but she has this feeling it's not going to be half an hour, one way or another.</p>
            <p>Doesn't matter. Hell is forever and she can endure that, too.</p>

            <p>All right.&nbsp; Abrogail thinks she is going to have to proceed under the assumption that the 'tropes' are real, and govern here.</p>
            <p>Her reasoning is not complicated; why, Sevar herself might see it if Sevar had the requisite +6 headband of all mental attributes.</p>
            <p>Keltham thinks he's describing a future event that he has to arrange in accordance with 'tropes'.&nbsp; That event has&nbsp;<em>already happened, without Keltham knowing it.</em>&nbsp; He has been fighting the true Queen this entire time, in front of Carissa, and, apparently to Carissa for now, won.</p>
            <p>In dath ilan's rhythm of prediction, success, credibility, that is a victory he has won.</p>
            <p>Abrogail has worked out by now a wordless sort of apprehension as to what sort of things 'tropes' are, namely, things out of stories, except that they're not the 'tropes' of Cheliax or Golarion, they're the 'tropes' of dath ilan.&nbsp; But if dath ilan has, per transcript, girls who dream of becoming Dark Unilateral Rulers, then dath ilan surely <em>also </em>has a 'trope' for appearing to have won when you haven't, because the person you're fighting is smarter than you and you never knew how many of your plans were known to her from the beginning.</p>
            <p>More the fool Keltham, if that thought hasn't occurred to him; and more the fool Carissa, if, knowing the true place of the Queen of Cheliax in all of this, it hasn't occurred to her to wonder the same.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>...or she could just not decide to do any of that, and then her life wouldn't be a 'trope'.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Possibly then there wouldn't be any 'tropes' around at all, she's not sure how that works.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Ice and fire alternate, in an unoccupied room nearby.&nbsp; Cycling between the two prevents the floors and walls from melting; it's not Abrogail's first time venting emotion where her adversaries will not see that and be warned.</p>

            <p>In the end, the logic behind Abrogail's last decision here is simple.</p>
            <p>She doesn't actually want to spend the rest of her life like this.</p>
            <p>She'd rather not be a 'trope'.</p>
            <p>In fact, she now <em>deeply </em>desires that there be no 'tropes' anywhere near Cheliax.&nbsp; Ever.</p>
            <p>And while she's not quite sure that this is how any of this works, she's going to do her part there.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"Well, then," Isidre says, and sighs.&nbsp; "I suppose you should go back and talk to Carissa and determine how she feels about being rented to the Queen, and I should see if you can meet the Queen at least briefly.&nbsp; And then maybe move directly to the confrontation with her and her advisors in sight of Carissa, then or very soon after.&nbsp; If everyone is sane, which I <em>do </em>expect them to be, Keltham, it should actually get done quite quickly - or I certainly hope so, because these are all very busy people.&nbsp; But time today is no more time than time tomorrow, and if possible we may as well get this done while we can do it without burning Teleports."</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>"Is your proposal here that we read in a couple hundred people on everything we know about the secret that may have started the godwar.... so that the betting markets resolve."</p>
            <p><br>"Yes," the Prince Merenre says. "Precisely because something about the situation may have started a godwar. It's important, so we need to be competent to reason about it, so the betting markets need to be something more than a fancy layer of fuzziness on top of all my personal guesses."</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I trust precisely thirty people with this," says the pharaoh of Osirion. "And all of them know better than to bet against you, ever, about anything where they don't have inside information."</p>
            <p><br>"In principle we can fix that with more lopsided payoffs," says Merenre. "They can't be infinitely confident in my being better than them."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I predict their bets-against-you will cluster around yours, if they're allowed to know yours, and maybe even if they aren't. What I want here is people who'll think of something you haven't. And less of a&nbsp;<em>spread - </em>because come on,&nbsp; this is ridiculous -"</p>
            <p>"Where are the markets at right now?" a serious, stiff-robed priest asks.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Our&nbsp;<em>eighty percent confidence interval&nbsp;</em>spans 'totally useless except to Abadar and three mathematicians' to 'the destruction of the multiverse'".</p>
            <p>"- how are they even resolving that -"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh, the usual. That's not the point, the point is, I can't govern like this."</p>
            <p><br>"What if we get predictors from Axis," says the King-Consort. "They've got better participation than us, there's a convenient list of exactly who to ask-"</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Can't afford them."</p>
            <p>"If this project is as important as the 50th percentile projection, we can give them the Sphinx."</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "- there's a policy proposal, I guess, raffle off every archeological relic in the country, except our God in his wisdom has copies of all of them already -"</p>
            <p><br>"Can you ask Him to pay to subsidize the prediction markets in Aktun?" says Merenre tiredly. This is technically a breach of protocol - they're not supposed to acknowledge, even in private, that the person of the pharaoh is not the person of Abadar Himself - but it's been a long two days since they first learned from Abadar of a complicated situation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We subsidize all the prediction markets in Aktun," says the pharaoh, who is not actually the person of Abadar Himself but is closer than most mortals come, and doesn't use the 'we' just as an affectation. "There's still the security question." There are reasons that sometimes when there are ongoing wars you don't just subsidize a bunch of public markets.</p>
            <p><br>Fe-Anar, the Pharaoh's father, mutters a phrase in the fast-changing language of the Maelstrom which no one who doesn't talk to proteans at least weekly, or have permanent Tongues, could hope to understand; it translates approximately to 'lol fuck the security question'.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pharaoh has permanent Tongues, and also did not need it to know what his father was going to say there. "One thing We would pay a lot to resolve is 'odds that Osirion and Cheliax end up at war over this," he says sharply, "and I expect Hell would also observe that with fascination. And while We don't find the arguments for squishing anomalies before they change Golarion persuasive, obviously, and are appalled that that's been policy for so many millenia, obviously, We're trading with a lot of entities that do find those concerns persuasive. But really We'd make it all public in Axis, subject to some standard nondisclosure agreements, if it weren't obviously an avenue for interference by Hell."</p>
            <p><br>"They've got to have their own predictions."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Only relevant market public in Hell is the one for the souls of some various adjacent parties, which, uh, keeps getting more expensive, I don't know how to interpret that exactly -"</p>
            <p><br>Fe-Anar mutters a phrase in the fast-changing language of the Maelstrom which translates best to 'fuck Hell'.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Amen," says everyone else, fervently; they keep on top of how the Maelstrom says that one.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br>"Is there not," says Merenre, "some kind of ordinary Aktun market participation contract understood to be robust against Hell - really I'm astonished that all Aktun market participation contracts aren't understood to be robust against Hell -"</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"They're robust in the sense that if they're fucking around, We'll take their money, in the long run."</p>
            <p><br>"And that long run is measured in - transaction volume? What goes wrong if we just subsidize it."</p>
            <p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "That long run is measured in transaction volume and also in time for arbitration courts to make them eat penalty clauses that're still financial in nature -"</p>
            <p><br>"So pay the courts to work inside a time-dilated demiplane. With all earned respect, &nbsp;if this has a one in ten chance of being as important as it looks, you aren't spending enough money on it!"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I literally cannot afford to spend money on ten things like this, so I need some way to figure out which one is going to get me more than a math textbook!"</p>
            <p><br>"The arbitration courts do already run at whatever speed is necessary for them to resolve in the contractually obligatory time. That's a month sidereal, for current events prediction markets," observes a sparkling ball of gears floating above one of the conference-table seats.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><br>"Do they promise they won't speed up and start settling everything overnight?"</p>
            <p><br>"They do not," says the sparkling ball of gears, with what might be faint amusement.<br>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>"First prediction market," says the King-Consort. "Pay a hundred top performers in Axis with a share of future returns from the work of Abadar's new cleric, to get up to speed and then predict what'll go wrong if we make the betting open in Axis and try to beat Hell at what is, in the end, our game, more than theirs."</p>
            <p><br>"The future returns from the project aren't ours."</p>
            <p>"The cleric's ours -"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The cleric's - so it's not clear he&nbsp;<em>is,&nbsp;</em>is the thing, Abadar's tried to show me what He's looking at but I don't understand it, and I certainly don't know that he considers himself to have entered into a trade relationship with us where we can conditionally commit his resources according to our model of what he'll be willing to pay for later -"</p>
            <p>"A share of future returns from the project conditional on the target agreeing that this market served his interests -"</p>
            <p><br>"Not to harp on this too much, but, all of what was just proposed plus 'inside time-dilation', we're already later to this than I'd like because of the Zon-Kuthon war -"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Because of the Zon-Kuthon war We have fewer resources to run bits of Aktun in time-dilation than We'd like."</p>
            <p>"Can you put numbers, when you say things like that, like, precisely how much time-dilation can we have at what multiplier on its usual cost."</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I really can't."</p>
            <p>"I mean, give me an order of magnitude -"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "If Abadar were able to put orders of magnitude in His visions then We would have so many fewer problems!"</p>
            <p><br>"Proposal: a communication to the target in Cheliax to the effect 'subsidizing prediction market in Aktun, evaluate policy questions relevant to you with promised share project returns, reply yes no"</p>
            <p><br>"Cheliax is we believe committed to not murdering him if in their evaluation he starts to look dangerous to their interests but they're neither above nor prohibited from neglecting to prevent his capture by Nidal. Which isn't to say not to contact him, it might be worth it, it's just to say, I continue to want some way of evaluating these ideas before we try them other than gut instinct."</p>
            <p><br>"Yeah, all right."</p>
            <p>"Market now, contact him in the dead of night if the market thinks it's a good idea, ready to grab him if he decides to leave Cheliax -"</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have you learned anything from the last two days," says the pharaoh. "We will make absolutely no plans with a twelve-hour time horizon. Who knows which gods will be at war by then."</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>...that means she should also probably take her punishment before she goes back to Keltham, and she's currently in the wrong mental state for it, namely euphoric and full of giddy terror, but she's not actually the out-of-control child Abrogail seems to think, she can talk herself around. She trots over to the temple and contemplates dath ilani Lawful Evil, which they do tell stories about apparently, Evil Keepers who wield the Law for their own benefit. She wants to be that. Cheliax doesn't understand dath ilan but it does understand how to harden Evil in someone's heart, how to turn human weaknesses in so they feed Evil impulses not Good ones. She needs that. And she deserves punishment, because she erred, and doesn't want to blunder through the world unpunished until she faces the ultimate punishment for an error too big to overlook. Asmodeus said to punish her as his Law requires, because otherwise she'll err too far before reality shows up to correct her.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Keltham has her childish, stupid heart, because he's rich and powerful and willing to walk away from Cheliax over her and it's very cute, but Cheliax owns her body and soul, and this is, in the evaluation of a system designed for punishing weakness and building Evil in human hearts, what she needs.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There, that's better. She will just have to not let all that Asmodean conviction be shaken by the sight of Maillol.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>She notices herself trying to think of something else to say, and makes herself turn and walk away towards the torture chamber.</p>

            <p>Children tend superstitious - it's worse if you cry, it's worse if you don't, it's worse if you seem scared. Carissa's not a child. She doesn't know the heart of whoever's on staff, she doesn't know what they enjoy seeing, it probably doesn't matter very much. The benefits don't derive from the punishment being executed exactly correctly; anything that requires that much finesse can only happen in Hell. There is to a first approximation nothing at all she can do that will matter.&nbsp;</p>

            <summary>Torture details spoilered.</summary>
            <p>It's the second most physically painful experience of her life, and opening Abrogail's gift bag earlier helps a lot to appreciate how much it could be worse.&nbsp; Unlike Abrogail's bag, which is meant to amuse Abrogail to think of it, disciplinary torture is meant to educate and improve the soul and not <em>just</em> be pleasing to Asmodeus.</p>
            <p>They show you what's coming, to let you contemplate your error.&nbsp; They apply it only somewhat painfully at first, so you can still think coherently about your mistake, and fear how much worse it's going to get, and regret, and then they make it worse and worse to drive the behavior firmly out of you, once you've had that chance to fix in your mind what you did wrong and how much you regret it.</p>
            <p>If you want your pain to mean something, if you want to relate productively to your own torture and suffering, Asmodeus's torturers are doing all the right things to make sure you can.&nbsp; At least if you've been sent in for corrective torture, and not this-is-the-fate-you-should-have-feared-and-now-you-have-earned-it torture.</p>
            <p>The Queen's order calls for the corrective sort of torture.&nbsp; It's a good thing that happened before Abrogail became less optimistic about whether Sevar could be salvaged, or more personally annoyed with her.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>It lasts a lot longer. At least Carissa thinks so, she never actually asked how long the bag lasted. This had a duration written neatly on the scroll she turned in. And she's pretty sure it's longer, because her voice is much, much hoarser, and her face much stickier with snot and tears, and she gets <em>tired,&nbsp;</em>in a way she doesn't think she has before, random uninjured muscles screaming about having been tense for so long.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It'll be worse in Hell.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She understands her mistakes better. She won't make them again. There isn't another way to get this result; dath ilan tries to do everything with rewards, but that just builds stunted little Good people who'd <em>go to Abaddon</em> rather than not get their fair share of a deal.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Carissa would never, ever go to Abaddon. If you told her this was all that was left to her forever, more of this, she wouldn't go to Abaddon. She is strong where the people of dath ilan are weak; she can live in worlds they can't.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>She hopes someone is reading her mind because she requests healing adequate to conceal signs of injury from Keltham but can't seem to make her mouth move right now.</p>

            <p>Should he just - keep doing this.&nbsp; It seems like cheating.&nbsp; It seems a <em>lot</em> like cheating.&nbsp; It seems like the sort of cheating that means nobody ever wants to cofound a startup with you.&nbsp; Carissa just said she was delighted under the truthspell that he did it.&nbsp; You could establish an awful lot of trust that way, modulo the chance that after they saw his first truthspell they were very thoroughly prepared, or maybe prepared before the first truthspell, etcetera, he didn't request Invisibility Purge today.</p>
            <p>The common sense of dath ilan says to, like, think dangerous things through before you do dangerous things, not try to improvise them as you go.&nbsp; Especially when you have two more Truthspells, to use later if needed - shit he should've cast Augury before he tried that, oh well, he'll get used to having magic eventually.</p>
            <p>Is there anything he needs to ask&nbsp;<em>right now...</em></p>

They should've been ready with the illusion at least from 'answer as soon as this question finishes'. "I don't actually know when the last time you used a truthspell was," she continues. "Did you use one with Isidre, that <em>might&nbsp;</em>have been faked, she's powerful enough to cast that anti-Enchantment spell that your god gave you for the Kuthites and I bet she knows it.

          <div class='post-content'><p>There are some sights you see very rarely in Golarion, and one of those sights is the Grand High Priestess of Asmodeus clutching a sheaf of parchments and laughing so hard there are tears in her eyes and she's having to physically lean against the wall and is probably going to hit herself with Lesser Restoration when this is over to make up for how much she isn't breathing and all of these paroxysms are making her stomach physically hurt but none of this matters because Aspexia Rugatonn has now reached the part where Keltham is completely innocently explaining to the Queen of Cheliax that if she doesn't act like a fucking sane person for once in her entire life she will be either unceremoniously removed from the throne or forced to become his girlfriend.<br><br></p>
            <p>That... might not be such a bad idea actually?&nbsp; Though not in <em>that</em> sense, of course.</p>
            <p>It's just that Keltham - for all his headstrongness, his errors, his delusions, his total spoilation and lack of discipline bestowed by his Lawful Good society's insanely permissive upbringing - still in other ways radiates a powerful impression that... well.&nbsp; &nbsp;That he could not only understand Aspexia's notion of 'corrigibility' after three minutes of explanation, but would possibly even invent it all himself the moment he understood what Asmodeus's own problems were like as seen from His perspective.</p>
            <p>They have no idea what dath ilani halfbloods will be like, at this point.&nbsp; But depending on how they turn out, if they can keep half of all that Law and be raised also Evil, it's plausible that the Church of Asmodeus would really, really, and by 'Church of Asmodeus' Aspexia Rugatonn here means 'Aspexia Rugatonn', really, really, <em>really</em> want somebody on the throne of Cheliax who could understand the concept of 'corrigibility'.</p>
            <p>Abrogail Thrune II's compact with Asmodeus says that, while she can bear any number of potential heirs to men of her own choosing, the Church may twice ask of her a father of the Church's own choosing.&nbsp; As for who inherits, that is something that only a compact with Asmodeus can decide.</p>
            <p>The Church hasn't asked that of Abrogail, so far, because there's been no candidate that would be worth the amount of fuss they'd get.&nbsp; Abrogail's compact says that she needs to do it, but the incompetent devil who framed that compact unfortunately did <em>not </em>specify that Abrogail needed to act professional about receiving such a request.&nbsp; Rather a massive oversight, as it turned out, among many others.&nbsp; So far Abrogail has borne no children at all; but this is not a national problem, there are other Thrunes who could compact with Asmodeus.</p>
            <p>Aspexia Rugatonn will have to seriously consider whether she wants to <em>actually </em>do this, or just threaten to do it in order to witness the look on Abrogail's face.&nbsp; Those are the only two options, to be clear, there is no third.</p>
            <p>But first she's going to finish reading.</p>

            <p>Abrogail Thrune II, now in her true outer form, is wearing royal robes much simpler than those she usually wears, and sitting in a simpler chair than the Throne of Cheliax.&nbsp; She's flicking breadcrumbs to the fish that spend their whole lives confined to this artificial brook.</p>
            <p>As much as Abrogail is annoyed by other aspects of the affair, including the manner in which she was the author of her own destruction, she's never going to get a chance to do this again in her entire life and have somebody actually buy it.&nbsp; So, yes, she's feeding breadcrumbs to the fish.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham, having left his escort behind a few steps ago, steps into the tiny park and gives an approving nod; like much of the Imperial Palace, this place seems acceptably pretty for a civilized society.</p>
            <p>The Queen of Cheliax... is superstimulus-level hot the same way as Contessa Lrilatha, but much more dangerously so on account of looking human.&nbsp; Keltham is glad that he knows that magical beauty treatments exist (is <em>that</em> why the plot point of Carissa getting one?) because otherwise his ero-route trope alarms would be blaring even louder.&nbsp; It makes perfect sense that the Queen of Cheliax is absurdly hot, of course she is, she'd be able to afford it in a society with the economicmagic for that; it's not at <em>all</em> inevitably the case that she's going to try to steal Carissa, or that one way or another the two of them <em>will </em>end up fucking no matter how contrived the reason, no, not at all.</p>
            <p>She also looks tired.&nbsp; Exhausted, even.</p>
            <p>"Sorry about this," Keltham says apologetically, as he comes over to sit in the chair left next to the Queen's own chair, which is exactly as fancy as hers.&nbsp; "I realize you're probably pretty busy.&nbsp; Exhausted even."</p>

            <p>If one of those agenda items was causing the downfall of another god, he'd treat it no differently than any other.&nbsp; Gods, to Keltham, are things to be coordinated-with; and if they <em>don't </em>coordinate, they have to be put down, first temporarily by other gods, and then permanently by the eventual Civilization that Zon-Kuthon feared and that Keltham sees an opportunity to build.</p>
            <p>He's stranger, and maybe a tiny bit scarier, when he thinks about matters on a larger scale than his woman Carissa.&nbsp; Finding himself in a world with gods is no different to him from finding himself in a world with fish; they are both just ordinary real things to him once he knows they exist.</p>

            <p>Keltham will spend the next five minutes extemporizing an elevator pitch on Civilization, the nice things that it has, and how while there's lots of specific nice things, the much more important thing is going into an <em>attractor</em> made out of harmonizing bits of Law that lets you start figuring out those things yourself.&nbsp; Now and then, though, Keltham quite visibly (to either Abrogail) hesitates to mention some unknown thing, and then says something else instead.</p>

          <div class='post-content'><p>Keltham explained the Law of this to his class yesterday, before Zon-Kuthon attacked - sorry, Keltham didn't mean to suggest there was a causal connection to that Law in particular being told.&nbsp; Keltham considers the starting point for negotiations given that Law to be pretty straightforward.&nbsp; He does want it clear that this is not his opening offer in a Golarion-style illegible negotiation meant to be bargained down; but if she's read the full class transcript with that incredibly fancy headband, the Queen will know all about that.<br><br></p>
            <p>Keltham's private thoughts?&nbsp; Exactly the same as what he says aloud; there is no dishonesty in him, no dishonesty at all, when it comes to trade.&nbsp; That's not because he's nice, but because he knows what fairness is and will not lightly brook any departure from it, whether by himself or any other.&nbsp; In that sense, if in very few others, this young man could pass as an ordinary cleric of Abadar.</p>

            <p>It's admirably Evil and would probably count in Pharasma's sight too; though it's pretty obvious Keltham doesn't <em>realize </em>that the wealth he takes away would starve some number of orphans that would otherwise have lived had those taxes been less.&nbsp; Maybe even if he knew, he'd shrug and say that it was still fewer total orphans than would've starved if Keltham had never come to Cheliax; it's not Abrogail's read on him, though.</p>

            <p>Abrogail does have some thoughts about how Keltham's gains, if he tries to leave, could be made payable to him 'in the standard backing of value for Chelish currency'.&nbsp; The trouble is, that gets caught by that incredibly audacious clause he innocently dared to offer Lrilatha about avoiding terms expected to have unexpected unpleasant consequences.&nbsp; If Keltham's departure leaves behind most of his gains in the form of a Cheliax-only investment fund, if they can get away with including that clear and understood term, it might save Cheliax quite a lot of loss.</p>
