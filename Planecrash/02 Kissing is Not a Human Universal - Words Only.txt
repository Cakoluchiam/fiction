Kissing is not a human universal

Try pressing your lips to the back of your hand not completing the kiss not applying brief suction just pressing your lips there Then try running your finger over your hand There may be a subtle difference but its not that obvious of a sexy thing to do if you dont have cultural expectations backing it up The small brief suction of a kiss if you try it on yourself is a slightly larger difference but maybe not distinguished as a special sexual action across widely separated cultures any more than running your finger in a circle

Dath ilan doesnt share Golarions custom of kissing as such

Dath ilan has however noticed generally that you can put your mouth on other people Putting your mouth on somebody elses mouth is an obvious symmetrical special case of this In fact the Baseline term for lipkissing is a four syllable double compound term meaning symmetrical mouth application expressed using some unusual word choices that makes the term look like a syllabic neighbor of symmetrical genital docking which in turn is a term that is to the Baseline fuck what sexual intercourse is to fuck in Taldane only with a more humorous connotation because theres less reason not to just say fuck

The notion of putting your mouth on somebodys anatomy but then not using any tongue at all while it has obviously happened a great many times over the history of dath ilan would be a longer word in their language an event of lower probability with a correspondingly longer efficient code The ability to either apply tongue or to take something inside your own mouth is the obvious reason why you would in the first place put your mouth on somebodys anatomy rather than just using fingers on the same location

Putting your mouth over somebody elses lips is a significantly higher sexual escalation in dath ilan than it is in Golarion mostly because once it had happened you wouldnt particularly be expecting the motion to then conclude with a brief light suction

 Even a lipkiss with symmetrical tongue however wouldnt enable you to steal the other persons clothing afterwards Stealing other peoples clothing is not even slightly a thing in dath ilan unless theyre already clothes from a communal pool of unfitted guest clothes or adaptably fitted costumes Normal clothes are objects fitted and customized to particular human bodies just like beds or chairs

Keltham is briefly shocked that Carissa is escalating that fast then rapidly questions his first impression and realizes that symmetrical mouth application may be a specially convenient case for interplanar romance because he can just mirror whatever she does using the same appendage A few moments later he is surprised again when all Carissa does with her mouth is apply a brief light suction to his own lips Deliberate teasing Anyways Keltham will just apply some brief light suction right back

Carissa would normally be more stressed out by trying to interpret all Kelthams facial expressions is he confused but this is in many ways the least stressful situation shes been in in a day and its one shes possessed with instincts for unlike trying to serve Asmodeus which humans are known to be terrible at so its easier to just go with it and set all the interpretation thats not immediately necessary aside for later She pulls away slightly but leaves her hand on his shoulder By normal Chelish standards if you havent negotiated anything eccentric she says we have now departed the range of things youre supposed to do if you have a monogamy agreement with someone else but not the range of things that let you say what were not even slightly sleeping together and we havent even entered the range of things you can make other girls jealous with in the morning

 By dath ilani standards were probably somewhere at around 5 1 out of 12 on the Standard Romance Escalation Lattice Scale on the pathway where we have sex to become friends instead of the other way around though the thing you did wasnt standard enough to have a standard rating and could maybe have been 4 8 instead which would be a good deliberate ambiguity maneuver if this were Complicated Romance Youd be allowed to do it with anyone else you wanted under all but the strictest quarter of monogamy agreements It wouldnt enable you to take my clothes and their informational private property as a trophy in a socially acknowledged way that let you get away with wearing my stuff to class tomorrow because that is far too perverted a practice for a young person like myself to have heard about it

 Oh dear How perverted will I have to spend tonight making you for that to be a practice that you expect a similarly perverted person back home will have encountered

 Your goals are unrealistic but you shouldnt let that stop you from trying Keltham leans forward slowly in case she wants to object takes Carissas head in his hand turns it gently aside and very lightly nibbles on her ear just about exactly as long as she kissed him for Five point two

 Why is he being slow is that considered more romantic in dath ilan or something Normal people dont have sex to become friends they have sex to have sex or to be useful to someone else who has something they want or to put someone in a compromising position of some kind She is going to mention none of these confusions

 Theres no such thing as unrealistic goals in Golarion unrealistic timescales maybe But Im optimistic See my understanding is that wed fall right off those dath ilani scales if you bite down now And once youre off the scale well anything can happen

 without any conscious thought at all in a fragmentary perceptual moment Keltham arrives at the meta level conclusion that he has been prompted to fast action and therefore fast thought

 okay but how hard exactly is it okay to bite down she probably does not mean he is supposed to literally actually bite off a piece of ear or maybe she does

 there are healing spells here he needs to worry less

 Keltham himself has the power to heal granted him by his deity still unknown

Keltham quickly clenches his left fist presses his fingernails into his own palm in order to get a very quick concept of how much force might correspond to how much pain quickly increases the pressure until the pain seems substantial more than merely noticeable and then bites down around that hard on Carissas ear

She gasps not unhappily There see where are we on your scale now dath ilani

Along the Standard Romance Lattice on the most common pathway where first you have sex and then become friends the steps would be numbered as follows

0 Assumed prior knowledge commonly known mutual possession of the human heritage and of default frameworks laid down by Civilization

1 Mutual determination of probable receptivity to flirting via passive or nonflirtatious information gathering

2 Active flirting while maintaining plausible deniability

3 0 Overt common knowledge of mutual attraction achieved

3 Teasing or being nice to each other without physical contact maneuvering for later relationship advantage

4 Physical contact

5 Overtly sexual contact

6 Sex with genital participation

7 Maneuvering around whether or not to go on a second date

8 0 Common knowledge established of a relationship extending beyond a single encounter

8 Dating learning more about each other

9 Taking on obligations and commitments inside the relationship revealing of nontrivial private info to each other with attached secrecy obligations less than maximal ogamy arrangements for those into such things

10 Having a child or childless marriage lasting at least 15 years

11 Long term to indefinite marriage multiple children if so desired

12 Intention to be together in the Future for eternity

Technically according to this scale Keltham and Carissa have yet to achieve Step 0 Actually thats not just a technicality That part is in fact quite important But the most correct answer to the intent of Carissas question would be that the Standard Romance Lattice doesnt consider the current depth of perversion as a detail that matters to assessing the rest of the scale If adapted to include sadomasochism in the obvious way itd parse up stimulation by pain into an equivalence class of other acts that produced around the same amount of arousal in the target If Keltham knew how much of a sexual act biting Carissa Sevars ear actually is to her which he doesnt hed probably put that at around 5 7 on the standard scale

 Lit sexual overcomplication

 We have gone forever outside of what is conceivable to Civilization Now that Ive bitten somebodys ear no city would allow me to enter there even if I could return to my home plane again none of them would consider me a dath ilani anymore

 not literally thats humor with a straight face I will also not include this disclaimer in the future unless you tell me to do that He bites her ear again slightly harder

Gasp I can tell by reading your expressions And also by knowing enough now to guess that your returning home would be a national emergency in a fashion that had nothing to do with sex There would be SO MANY important people asking serious questions before we could arrange imports of girls who like being bitten you wont harm me by accident s actually hard for people who havent practiced it to bite another person like theyd bite a steak and Im third circle that wouldnt harm me

 Wait You being a third circle wizard means that even if I tried to bite your ear literally as hard as I can you wouldnt need a healing spell afterwards Keltham will have Additional Questions about this later but right now the notion of biting her ear without being careful or worrying about it is tapping something deeper

She kisses him again a little more forcefully Yes Thats right There are six competing theories of why and I will tell you none of them unless you tickle them out of me

Keltham kisses back running his tongue lightly over her lips and then draws her own lip into his mouth and bites down HARD without holding himself back If it was just ears but not lips hes got healing

In some alternate universe where higher circle casters only have less vulnerable ears and otherwise normal vulnerability Carissa would be bleeding well long ago dead at the Worldwound actually Instead she leans into Keltham and shivers Quick learner s a good trait Youre pretty lucky to have both a girl you can hurt and a girl you cant really hurt for the first time at the same time

Keltham is now very hard and he didnt even notice that happening to himself at the time because he was distracted No kidding I dont know how it is for men here but I get the distinct impression that being able to do what I want to you without holding myself back and have you react sexually to that is much more the thing Im discovering than applying small careful amounts of pain I think Im ready for this to move to a cuddleroom

 Or repurposed bedroom Could be my bedroom even if youre pretty sure your magic lets you do to the bedroom afterwards what you did to my clothes

 Magic can clean it But also I recall a bedroom at the bottom of these stairs She holds herself back from examining the zippers too closely even though suddenly theyre right there to look at and theyre fascinating incredibly uniform down the whole seam and wrong for the mood right now

 Youre the native The alien will trust you about whether we can do that without prior authorization Keltham stands offers her a hand

 Keltham has noticed where her eyes were drifting of course The prior probability for that wasnt low He would definitely be checking out the hot alien chicks technology in an appropriately analogized gender reversed position Hes not much worried about IP theft though the real trick to the zipper isnt going to be the interlocking shapes its going to be cheaply making a thousand copies of those interlocking shapes

She takes his hand If we break the bed Ill simply tell the facilities staff that we were studying dath ilani sex tradition and productive interactions with the Golarion sex tradition of having a girl you can do as you please with

Theres whole strange worlds opening up to Keltham though hes not at all sure hes understanding them correctly The notion of having a woman you can do as you please with well theres the version where you pay a sex worker so that you dont have to worry about their pleasure except insofar as it pleases you to do so a sexual asymmetry balanced by a financial asymmetry going the other way or by knowledge going the other way in the variant Ione offered him but the notion of a woman who doesnt allow you but wants you to do as you please wants you to hurt her

Hell sort out later whats going inside his mind He may be ordinarily accustomed to knowing more about what goes on in there but he doesnt have to sort it out right now before having sex

Keltham grips her hand harder because he felt an impulse like that and pulls her after himself toward the stairs going down because that feels like the right thing to do

Possibly she is going to take this too far and push Keltham to uncover desires that she actually has to use a lot of will and acting ability and preparation forthe cleansing fires ofHell to keep up with and she should instead be trying to push him in smaller steps but then she would lose the contest and shes very competitive Also if she pushes him very far then the other girls who are mostly younger will have a harder time keeping up Yeah this is a good plan

She follows

Keltham is entertaining Suspicions about how many planes of existence exactly just happen to contain women who like totally want you to bite their ears and lips and will derive their own sexual pleasure from it instead of disliking pain in accordance with all sane evolutionary logic and also they wont end up actually injured if you do that and how likely it is that he would end up someplace like that just at random but he will think about that later If some unknown force throws you into a suspiciously sexually compatible universe the optimal response should include fucking that universe and not just contemplating how suspiciously sexually compatible it is

Once theyre down the stairs hell give Carissa a sudden surprise push to the bed and then be about to leap on her when he remembers the existence of windows and doors that need closing Wait here he says the words coming out a little more forcefully than they should have and goes to try to seal the room insofar as that seems to be a thing

The room has a door to the hallway a door to the private bathing rooms and a door to the balcony it has one window opposite the bed and positioned to shed light on the writing desk near the fireplace with heavy curtains presently drawn over it The door to the hallway and the door to the balcony both lock to keep people out

 Looking for something Fireplace pokers are the kind of thing Id need healing spells about

 Sealing the room insofar as that seems to be a thing Dont suppose theres a switch Im missing for whatever magical version of soundproofing youve got Or for that matter something that tells the security people to get any five year olds out of the hidden wall tunnels or switch the security cameras to only asexual observers

 I really hope there are no five year olds anywhere on the premises The walls are nearly a foot of solid stone no one will hear us unless theyre creeping on the balcony and if were being scried then they can just hear us and we can tell them and she looks up at the ceiling hey have a devil of the kinds that are too inhuman for sexual desire do the necessary observation of how Keltham hasnt been stealthily kidnapped or murdered

Keltham did not think devils were that easy to consult on key national issues let alone employ as security observers but he will defer all infinite Additional Questions until later I hadnt meant to ask for anything expensive just checking if we were supposed to nevermind

Back to the bed Its not going to be easy having sex on a flat soft surface but its possible Lots of things are possible if youre sufficiently determined about them sexually speaking

Carissa Sevar didnt seem to think that escalating slowly and in order was particularly romantically important to her which is good because right now Keltham is feeling an alarmingly strong impulse to do exactly what his impulses tell him and what his impulses tell him to do is throw off his shirt

Keltham taking off his jacket shirt is going to look strange to an inhabitant of Golarion not accustomed to overengineered dath ilani clothing

In principle one spends a lot of time in clothes and hence should be willing to spend some money on better clothes

In practice there is a certain element in Civilizations clothing choices of that dath ilani personality trait which always puts a hidden passageway behind at least one bookcase in the house library Often one that just goes around a short corner and exits from a different bookcase in the same library The point is the hidden passageway has to be there and if you ask why the people of dath ilan will smile and tell you to shut up

Kelthams jacket shirt assembly includes more technology than just zipper slides It has been painstakingly designed by a cultural accumulation over time of engineers with 4sd intelligence to among other things manifest a rainproof hood from no obvious receptable convert between warmer and colder coverage and be easy to remove from yourself while youre already cuddling somebody without having to disentangle yourself This easy removal feature makes good use of micro velcro fine enough to not be obvious from a distance and arrays of tiny rare earth magnets which automatically pull bits of fabric back together again in a correct stepwise pattern

From an outside perspective one would see Keltham tear his jacket shirt off of himself with an audible ripping sound and end up holding a jacket with no visible damage If you were watching closely enough youd see the jacket split along the seams and then quickly come together again along those same seams The way this registers from outside is not an accident or any kind of side effect of other design purposes A mad engineer who would detect in Golarion as INT 26 spent several years figuring out exactly how to do that and make it look cool subsequently collecting 0 1unskilled labor hour royalties on over 200 000 000 pieces of clothing

Keltham kneels over where he threw Carissa to the bed one knee between her thighs not bothering to avoid touching anything How do I take off your shirt he says after a brief moment of failing to see any affordances for doing that

 My shirt does not do that Does everyones clothes do that She doesnt see how without magic or why stop getting distracted by textile manufacture questions It buttons With buttons She demonstrates one

Huh thats a surprisingly elegant solution to the problem of clothing that must be built with imprecise manufacturing technology The button hole doesnt have to be exactly the same size as the button its okay if no two buttons are exactly the same size as each other and the fastening method is robust to small departures of the shape from if this line of thinking is not centrally necessary to sex with Carissa it can wait

Keltham undoes all the buttons he can see the motions unpracticed but not too slow its obvious enough how a button works once you see one

And her shirt lies open before him

Carissa Sevar is older than any woman hes previously lain with and prettier than them in his sight as far as he can tell from just her exposed chest Carissa being seven years older than him works for him on a physical level it seems so long as hes not at a social power disadvantage to her the way he would have been to an older woman of Civilization

Keltham wonders if theres a nonbutton trick hes missing for how he could remove Carissas shirt sleeves from her arms without her needing to rise up from her laid down position but also Keltham doesnt feel the need to do that right now The alien clothing on the sexy alien female isnt something he minds

 I approve he says a little breathlessly eyes going between Carissas face and her chest

Carissa knows that she is pretty There are things its smart to lie to yourself about in Cheliax that isnt one of them It matters for a lot of things you get lots of data on it it is not suspicious to be competent at it and its vaguely pathetic not to be to be living in a fantasy where you are prettier than you really are or one where youre average and the way people respond to you is mostly about your charming personality when you are not average and its not about your personality at all In a room of girls her age shell be the prettiest if it wasnt selected on that and if it was shell be average unless it was selected hard on that reaching the point where people deploy magic potions she cant be mistaken for the kind of woman whos done that not once youve met them The worry about attracting the notice of the pharaoh of Osirion is realistic given certain bounds of uncertainty about how much he likes exoticness

For a statement that contains approximately no new information Kelthams approval is oddly satisfying

 If you are characteristic of men with your taste she says youll like it even better when its marked up a little

 I expect Ill be very excited by whatever that actually means but that idiom in Baseline means something implausible unless you actually did want me to annotate you

 Your poor language She pinches her breast hard enough to leave a bright red mark when she pulls her hand away Your poor civilization You may have coordination but towards what end if the only thing to do with unblemished skin is to annotate it

Keltham notes somewhat to his own surprise that his hands are slightly trembling The impulse to pinch her harder than that to get sounds out of her again is powerful enough that well that its now absolutely obvious why dath ilan doesnt want sexual pain dealers to know what they are if theres no improbable invulnerable sexual pain receivers around to complement them He is struggling between two mutually inhibitory instilled reflexes the training out of dath ilan which says that in the cuddleroom of all places youre supposed to just follow your impulses and his acculturation out of dath ilan to be careful about hurting people no stop thats stupid he couldnt even produce blood when he bit down hard on her lip

Keltham allows his hand to do what it wants seizing her other breast and grabbing as hard as he can digging in with fingernails

Carissa thinks it is far too early in the evening to notreact to something he does look at him challengingly and ask if he can do it more than that That is a good move to have in reserve Right now she has thrown enough complications onto the table and should just let Keltham explore them She should shudder and wiggle and reach for his hand but not to pull it away and smile at him

 Good is wrong Carissa believes this mostly because the possible Carissas who dont have been neatly pruned from existence or hypothetical existence but it feels like theres another angle on believing it here dath ilan layering all their propaganda to hide from people what they are because their beautiful Good abundant empire didnt have space for the hunger of humans to hurt each other and be rewarded for it to have something that is theirs and that they neednt treat with caution

 the desires in yourself that have no place in Axis

 maybe though she shouldnt even dream of it its true of Keltham too

If he did this to a normal dath ilani woman shed be at least saying ow and the fact that Carissa isnt yelling isnt having her face tighten up in pain that she can still choose to just smile at him in response he feels like he needs to hurt her more than this take that control away from her and he almost stops to ask if hes thinking it right except that he he can see himself as others see him he can see his own story as a reader would see it he can guess where this trend is going and if not Carissa can tell him in words to stop

His other hand seizes her nipple traps it between thumbnail and forefinger nail and bites down on that nipple with those two fingernails as much as his grip strength allows

You have to think about these things very quickly a delay will betray you Most men will keep going until they get the reaction they want some for a while after that so you want to start grimacing and whimpering and flinching substantially shy of your actual limit so its not too bad later either She bets that in dath ilan thats not even Complicated Romance its probably like a major social faux pas or something

It does hurt a lot more than would be sexy in isolation which it so so profoundly isnt and a lot more is sexy when its part of a game played with your body for the sake of getting things you desperately want She flinches and whimpers But only a little and then she goes back to smiling at him

 Youre cute

Hes satisfied a little by that flinch and whimper Part of him is reassured about still being addressed in favorable terms afterwards that he didnt make a misstep Part of him seems to feel an overpowering need to be otherwise to her than

 Maybe youll tell me that the first date is too early for it he says his voice coming out lower huskier than he expected from himself or that nobody gets it their first day but I hope theres a path to eventually escalate a relationship like this one to where Im something other than cute

 You can get a girl to call you all kinds of things including on the first date Hurting people is very effective for that it does typically take a little longer to make her mean it

For her to call him what Keltham doesnt know There is something but he doesnt know what

Implied in Carissas words is that theres a version thats a game and a version that isnt just a game He can already feel from where he is that this must be so But he doesnt know what lies beyond this beyond just the sexual infliction of pain And maybe he shouldnt ask shouldnt delve too greedily and too deep upon a first date He doesnt want to slow down for explanations either he can ask afterwards

 Dont call me anything you dont mean he says and theres an undertone in his voice that isnt often heard in dath ilan what he said should have been a request its not clear what multiagent equilibrium could sensibly exist here where that could be something other than a request but it wasnt one And because it felt right his hand pressed fingernails into her breast again as he said it

She shivers that parts easy

Carissa possesses a convenient degree of sexual enjoyment of pain she doesnt have a particular tendency to use whats hot as an input into who she obeys or to find it hot rather than convenient when people obey her But she can recognize the thing he wants better than he can at least and

 four pillars of Asmodeanism one of them tyranny enjoyment of power and its exercise one she doesnt have particular aptitude for but a path to Asmodeus just as valid as her own

 Yes Keltham she says quietly meeting his eyes And if you were a ruler to whom I had sworn my loyalty then it would be yes my lord like so

Keltham clamps down on an impulse to pull back his hand like it was burned something is escalating too far and too fast

Naturally Keltham has been at one point in his life told Very Seriously that men are also allowed to decide that something sexual is escalating too quickly for their comfort even if thats not the typical gendertrope depicted for the male sex in books and movies And to this Keltham had replied that he was in fact a quite archetypal male who would never have need of that advice But because Keltham had also been possessed of at least average intelligence imagination and reflection Keltham had added after another moments thought that this might not be true if there were secret levels of sexual escalation he was having difficulty imagining And this of course the Watcher had neither confirmed nor denied

Courage Keltham thinks to himself and keeps his hand where it is He is typical male enough that typical male gendertropes are useful to him and he wordlessly autoexpects for it to do well by him if he draws on that to not look hesitant in front of a sex partner

 Theres something there I want he says but its deep and its complicated and even though you obviously already know what it is Im not going to understand it right away and I dont want to stop while you explain it to me I do know I want to be to you as I would be to a sex worker whose time Id bought only not like that but as if shed just given it to me the ability to do what I want with you I dont want to trade pleasures with you I want to force pleasure out of you and hurt you while I do that and then hurt you again while you pleasure me in turn

 Yes she says because shes getting the sense that they both individually and together have a failure mode of talking too much when only a little would do

Keltham has read the description of standard wizard cantrips and he expects hes guessed at least part of magical sexual practice in Golarion especially since he doubts their tech level suffices for ingestable latent flavorants You can use Prestidigitation now to flavor my Taldane doesnt have very detailed words for the components of semen or their anatomical storage places stored sexual fluids however you prefer he says looking down on her darkly And for myself I want you tasting like chocolate

This is in fact a thing Carissa has ever done but she is intensely curious about under what algorithm it comes to mind as one of the first she should think less Entirely too much thinking

She takes his wrist and moves his hand with hers while she casts a cantrip Probably I did what you said she says Youve hardly got the spellcraft to know for sure I guess you could check

 In a world of a billion people around a hundred million minutes per day are going to be spent tasting male sexual fluids or around 50 000 years per year and at least an order of magnitude more for that portion of women who desire oral sex where the fluid tasting phase lasts much longer And thats just the momentary hedonics if a suboptimal taste were permitted to act as a negative reinforcer for sex itself that would destroy an order of magnitude more happiness still It would be silly to not have hundreds of top engineers working on the problem of making people taste 10 better Though you dont especially need good social coordination for that theyd say because Markets they would be surprised if you told them a world could have Markets but somehow not those top engineers

Theres always been a strange impulse any time Keltham is asked to do anything during sex for him to want to do something else instead like he wants to not do anything that could be remotely seen as doing what somebody else says Keltham has always chalked this up to an excessive level of individualism even for himself and gone on trading pleasures and fairly providing that which he trades since he cant afford yet to routinely trade money instead Now hes starting to suspect its something else entirely

 I guess I could Keltham says and as his fingers go down Carissas pants his fingernails move aside and dig hard into her thighs instead

 The thought that Carissa was inviting him to monitor and enforce her obedience or to punish her if she hadnt done as requested does not occur to Keltham yet not at all those are still ideas that require much longer codes in his native language of thought for he has not seen all their pieces

Or he can do that sure She bites her lip lets her breathing hitch just slightly Note to self have some kind of plan before explaining Golarion slavery to Keltham just in case instead of being appalled he is like that sounds great

These pants dont look bad on her but they have now become obstacles to Progress Obstacles to Progress must be removed

He almost starts to tear them off her but remembers in time that this wont work and undoes as many buttons as he sees before attempting further removal of the clothing

The pants have two buttons She contemplates making it slightly harder for Keltham to navigate them by wiggling but decides that while it is more fun for Carissa to be slightly difficult she has no real reason to think thats how Keltham prefers it she cant read that much into his not having reacted more strongly to previous being mildly difficult hes probably not calibrated on how much is appropriate

 and so she ought to try cooperating like hes been serious about it even though he hasnt She doesnt wiggle she does let her legs anticipate his movements so it takes hardly any effort to move her to pull off the pants

Her legs are as pretty as her chest

Keltham yanks off his own pants with the characteristic sound of micro velcro coming apart which sounds like cloth tearing at first and casts these apparently undamaged pants aside Dath ilan has not evolved separate underwear per se the bottom assembly just works off the shelf without added components being required

He is hard of course maybe harder than hes ever been If he knew that his contraception had followed him here survived the healing he performed on himself last night and not been surreptitiously removed by Chelish wizards in his sleep hed be fucking her so hard right now As it is the two of them are not on childbearing terms Be it clearly stated Keltham says in a thick voice that if Im not fucking you right now thats not because I dont really really want to

Not quite pretty enough for him to pass up on licensing fees huh Shes not even offended Under normal circumstances shed just offer to Polymorph it off and she in fact could offer that but then hell get distracted trying to think through whether he trusts her that that works and that sounds like a notat allsexy direction to push him in If he were slightly less of an alien shed say if you owned me youd also separately get to decide if we had children but hes an alien and that seems to run a genuine chance of stamping on something hes been assuming all wrong

 I admire your self control she says though she would actually really rather his self control not quite be adequate to the task

He briefly smiles thats a prideful thing for a woman to say when shes tempting you and Keltham likes pride

Keltham then checks also briefly teasingly whether Carissa tastes like chocolate He is careful to avoid the outward pleasure center with his tongue while he does that both for teasing reasons and because he doesnt know if shes a woman who requires warmup before direct clitoral stimulation

She does She doesnt play that difficult

Prestidigation based artificial flavor is very tastably artificial as the cantrip description warned but its still better flavor than dath ilan can manage in the absence of magic Keltham makes a mental note to tell her about this scored point for Golarion later hes not going to cheat on recordkeeping but right now he has other things on his mind

 If you want to lubricate yourself before my fingers go in nows the time he warns Carissa some watching part of himself noting how much that also isnt being phrased as a request

Most considerate baby dom He is doing his absolute best to do whatever he wants and hes still sort of tracking whether hes going to hurt her he doesnt know how not to

She does not let this show on her face she doesnt think Keltham would be flattered Im feeling pretty ready she says

 It frankly wouldnt occur to Keltham that going through the standard preflight checklist is being considerate Its just standard If one suggested to Keltham that this entry on the checklist was particularly a female serving one he would stare blankly for a moment and then observe that things may not go in if a woman isnt lubricated enough If you were having sexwith finegrained financial transfers the woman would not pay an additional fifty millims to add lube thats just a symmetrical convenience

Keltham hesitates then torn between an impulse to ask for directions for combining pleasure with pain correctly and a deeper desire not to ask for directions

 no Hell at least try it first on his own

His desires seem to want Carissa in a different position One hand goes to her thigh grabs pulls A dath ilani woman would know by convention of nonverbal cuddling signals that Keltham intended to rotate her turn her onto her stomach on the bed facing down

Carissa is not at all familiar with dath ilani cuddling conventions but she knows how to be very pliable And giggly just a tiny calculated bit of giggly

Some part of Keltham doesnt enjoy the giggly sound maybe at any other time he would but here and now its not the sound he wants to hear When Carissa is flipped onto her stomach he pulls her shirt from her to expose her back with the front of her shirt open that should be possible to remove now right

Yes Shes not wearing underclothes the shirt has chest support built in

A fine enough backside as well

With his dominant hand Keltham puts two fingers into Carissa yes shes lubricated enough and begins twofingered thrusts directed at the frontal vaginal pleasure nexus He escalates the pressure quickly over just the first dozen thrusts faster than he would escalate without clear signals from anybody who was less wet or less supposedly invulnerable

When hes reached the pressure level and rhythm thats the optimal guess for that pleasure nexus if you otherwise know nothing about the woman he rakes his fingernails hard down her exposed back He wants to see it annotated

Carissa can actually enjoy sex in the straightforward way where its nice and you like it but she cant do that and also do anything else so she usually doesnt You can get yourself off if thats all you are aiming to accomplish in the evening If she is trying to decide deliberately how to move and how to sound and what expressions to make and what her hands are doing then shes doing that and its like casting a high circle spell exhilarating compelling but not at all something youd straightforwardly describe as pleasant She is using her sensory input for too many things for just enjoying it She can notice while she takes cues from Keltham about how to move and how to twitch and how to breathlessly whimper that he has had probably quantitatively less practice at this than most adventurers at the Worldwound but is better at it presumably because girls in dath ilan have more bargaining power than girls in Golarion do or at least have fewer nonsex priorities theyre trying to arrange through sex and are therefore pointing more of the bargaining power they are possessed with at the sex itself being nice But Keltham being better at it is not very related to how she moves and twitches and whimpers and thats not even because shes trying to seduce him into Evil its just because you cant mindlessly enjoy things and react satisfyingly to them at the same time

Her back scratches up nicely

 Keltham is better at this because hes had deliberate training thank you very much What are your schools even teaching people if theyre not preparing them for such basic aspects of adult life

 This about dath ilan They never even considered not optimizing the shit out of sex There are regular Very Serious debates some of them hidden behind fourth tier pervertedness ciphers about which parts of sex should have the shit optimized out of them versus being let run wild and free But that no aspect of sex should be hyperoptimized at all would be a mad extremist position which nobody could take Very Seriously

There is to be sure the whole system of avoiding spoilers for young people which means that their earliest sex is not much optimized You only get to discover sex once after all you wouldnt want to spoil those surprises any more than youd tell kids about conservation of momentum instead of putting them in a setting where they can discover classical mechanics for themselves Now and then Civilization assembles together a group of recently initiated young geniuses who havent been told yet about any standard sexual methods and asks them to consider from scratch how sex should best be optimized just in case Civilizations accustomed thought patterns are missing something

It is not that dath ilan tries to destroy all naivety as fast as it can be destroyed by truth Some innocence is hedonically or scientifically useful to preserve for a time

But once you are initiated into the first tier of spoilered discussion for sex you get to learn about those standard optimizations that are simple common sense for repairing the defects of sex in a state of nature

And then of course exactly how much sexual training a young man might invest his limited skill points into depends upon that young mans hedonism horniness competitiveness competing life priorities and how much it bugs him to think he could be doing it better

 Keltham has competing life priorities and would not call himself particularly hedonistic He is however very competitive and sex does matter to his self told life story at all The amount of pleasure he has to give in trade feels to Keltham like a key figure of merit for his own sexual self worth and for this reason he has invested more skill points than most other young men his age Maybe most women his age are not in fact evaluating him as if he were a sexual product in a marketplace but Keltham feels on some level that they should be they should be evaluating what he has to trade and he doesnt like the thought of being unready if he meets a woman who is evaluating him The sexual standards he wants to live up to first and foremost are his own and that never felt to him like a place where he was naturally very self forgiving

So Keltham has ever spent a dozen hours practicing with a very carefully built anatomical doll hooked up to a room full of the best computers that are known publicly to exist learning how to play standard variation over female anatomy as if it were a video game and learning how to read standard variation over female sexual responses especially the ones that dont require voluntary action

Because among the defects of sex in a state of nature is for example that orgasms dont last nearly long enough in comparison to the rest of sex and if youre trying to optimize the integral of pleasure over time not that this is the figure of merit for sex but its a figure of merit then its a bonus sexual skill to be able to read how close your member ofdesired sex is to orgasm and hang out in the region where shes close but not quite there To be sure theres the very obvious version of this where she just tells you where she is or gasps out figures between zero and twelve or gives standard nonverbal signals but if she doesnt have to focus on doing that because you can just tell then you are able to do a Difficult Seeming Impressive Trick and she can have more fun without being distracted

Dath ilan does enjoy its Difficult Seeming Impressive Tricks like being able to tear a jacket shirt off of yourself and have it come out intact Or fingersnaps as theyre now sometimes known more briefly in a meme spread by the popcorn book series Science Maniac Verrez Keltham in particular likes Difficult Seeming Impressive Tricks And what lots of people spend lots of minutes doing Civilization spends big money on A lot of work went into designing the anatomical arcade system that trained Keltham to attempt this particular sexual fingersnap

 And also this of dath ilan faking your sexual responses is well mostly its not imagined but if imagined it would immediately be judged as serious business awfulness You dont want to live in an equilibrium where people having sex are constantly distracted by the question of whether their partners signals are real or fake Hiding your sexual responses during sex sure there are Complicated Romances like that but if you see something it ought to be real Learning that somebody youd trusted had done that to you would be the sort of betrayal where a dath ilani might be wondering for the rest of their life if it was going to happen to them again Telling a man that she deceptively faked her enjoyment with him is the sort of thing that a notredeemable fictional villain would do to her exboyfriend just before she stabbed him in the neck and left him to rot someplace his brain wouldnt be found in time

If somehow an adult were caught faking an orgasm and this was somehow socially proven it wouldnt get them kicked out of as many cities as if they deliberately raped somebody But it would get them excluded from around the same number of orgies and startups

Obvious exceptions obviously apply of course like in movie acting or scripted sex work there is a great difference between depiction and deception

Keltham isnt thinking that Carissa is deceptively faking her sexual responses its not someplace his thoughts would readily jump He is distracted among other things by the pattern of red trails hes managed to leave on Carissas back though his hardest raked fingernails havent made her bleed She is again right about him he likes seeing her annotated

Keltham is noticing that Chelish womens sexual responses dont make sense in terms of the patterns hes been trained for or at least Carissas finer patterns of breathing and muscle tensions arent matching up well with Carissas overt sounds and hes not sure which one he ought to believe Maybe theres some kind of Permanent Cheerfulness thing going on like with the research harem in his lessons If Carissa had spent a lot of time doing something like that during overcomplicated romances with no off switch she wouldnt necessarily be able to stop especially if she was otherwise distracted by fingernails Keltham does not wish to stop and talk about this either and its not like he can ask her to switch to a standard precoded nonverbal signal scale

Keltham decides he will mostly believe in Carissas less overt responses for now and starts experimenting with standard variations over optimal stimulation patterns to see if he can hill climb to anything that produces a readably different less overt sexual response or if he just cant read her at all

Carissa has no information about any of this and couldnt actually stop pretending if she tried the link between stimuli and responses is too interrupted for her to identify any particular response as natural Shes not even trying to guess what Keltham is going for specifically thats difficult even without a cultural divide in the way Probably hell do this until he gets bored and then want to enjoy himself which is much less complicated

Okay Carissas subtle tells are reading at the same low level for any pattern he tries including a set of tactics such that youd expect at least one set element to have a noticeable effect over a supermajority of dath ilani women

Which suggests that either Hypothesis 1 Keltham isnt able to read Carissa correctly at all or alternatively Hypothesis 2 that he just isnt using her correct sexual entry codes at all and shes got Permanent Cheerfulness going on

Subhypotheses of 1 Does dath ilani training do something that makes women more readable Does his own training assume the woman is a dath ilani whos had whatever goes into baseline female sexuality optimization

Subhypotheses of 2 Maybe Carissa has been messed up by this world somehow or is just untrained to operate optimally in the cuddleroom such that it would take a lot more work to raise her arousal to anywhere near an orgasmic level Even when Keltham and his agemates were reinventing sex without spoilers the cuddlerooms had vibrators and lubricants and ergonomic furniture lying around to figure out Can most women not trained to optimize their sexual responses even figure out how to have orgasms if not supplied with lubricants vibrators and ergonomic cuddling furniture

How sex works in a complete state of nature is not a topic that comes up much in Civilization Not being in a state of nature is what being civilized is

Keltham doesnt want to think about this right now He wants to preserve the heady momentum of discovering sadism not figure out further experiments to distinguish these multiple hypotheses and subhypotheses

And Carissa does not currently seem distressed She may not realize that there is any reachable level of sexual enjoyment beyond what shes experiencing now He can go further into exploring his own sadism and enjoyment and later go back to giving her pleasure in return trade trying harder to inflict pleasure on her even if he has to pause and ask for directions

Without saying anything in words Keltham stops stimulating Carissa and pulls her up from her facedown position on the bed maneuvering himself to be beside her and below her He has his own ideas about what he could tell Carissa to do but is curious to see what shell do on her own if initiative gets nonverbally passed to her

 oh good this is wildly less complicated Carissa knows how to give a blowjob and it seems really improbable that in dath ilan that either 1 works super differently or 2 is supposed to be accompanied by a performance of some kind more elaborate than I am sweet and cooperative and having a nice time because of how sexy you are which she is assuming that men want the world over More than the world over The shared genetic heritage over

Going direct for oral hm Keltham doesnt mind Theres a family of sex jokes whose punchlines go Even the farfrom optimal instances of particular sexact tend to be improvements farabove par and oral sex is often named as a classic example

Keltham is already quite worked up even after taking into account the temporarily distracting part where the sex got complicated enough that he had to start considering multiple hypotheses so it shouldnt take long to reach the part where he sees whether or not he can surprise Carissa with his other dath ilani sex technique that doesnt require technology but still probably shouldnt exist in a pretechnological world

Hell entertain himself and arouse himself further by trying to hurt Carissa while she works Can his fingernails reach her nipples from here given her current position

Yes she cant exactly do giggly while shes working but she can shift her weight to give him better access see look as cooperative as you can get as cooperative as you can get is not actually her preferred kind of Carissa to be its weird she even noticed that when she should be thinking about work clearly something about Keltham throws her off her game which is not a problem she can really afford to have Cooperative is a perfect Carissa to be Asmodeus notices people not just for their capacity to rise in Hell but for their capacity to serve Him wholeheartedly and uncomplicatedly and it feels obvious that shed want to do that so why not reach for that now in the presence of the person her god has spoken of as her teacher why not take the sort of topsy tervy mental motion after which she feels so small in his presence that to be as cooperative as he could possibly desire is all she can aspire to

 right Because shes lying to him thats the reason not to do that Because what she wants here is the performance of perfect submission accompanied by the mental state of coldly contemplated manipulation and so obviously its not going to feel like surrender its going to feel like walking a tightrope with a dick in her mouth of course thatd take a bit of getting used to

She squirms about being pinched and bats her eyes at Keltham

Keltham isnt trying to read her in very much detail its not like he even knows how to read level of pain either 0 or a very very tiny number of people in Civilization would ever get any training on that actually its almost certainly 0 because never mind who needs to know who would do the experiments to figure that out anyways Keltham isnt trying to read her in very much detail just enjoying himself

He makes no effort to hold back his own rising pleasure and he certainly isnt going to conceal his tells as he approaches the arousal level for potential orgasm hes curious about whether Carissa can read him and what she does about that if he can It would be an observational misstep to tell her what to do or even hint to her about what to do before hes had any chance to observe what she does on her own

 Medical personnel in fact

Carissa is pretty sure that she is supposed to get him off because that is how sex works Its one of the least complicated forms of human interaction really

Shes just going to make him come Keltham thinks as he reaches the verge of orgasm without any obvious attempts by her to delay it Thats a bit surprising maybe theres magic here for restoring male ejaculative potential as a special case of healing Or maybe she cant read him any more than he can read her

Keltham was hooked up to some complicated biofeedback machines which another society might even have deemed embarrassing in order to learn this next part which is why hes guessing that the natives here wont have it

Even so he has to shut his eyes and concentrate as he clenches some muscles and relaxes others and comes just a little into Carissas mouth

 That part where men come once and then their pleasure experiencing capabilities are reduced for a while maybe even finished for the duration

Less than ideal

Civilization spent money on improving over that until they could no longer figure out how to usefully spend any more money

 Surprise Keltham says the first words hes spoken in a while

Carissa has no idea what just happened but probably shes supposed to be impressed She doesnt have to have any idea what just happened to guess that impressed is better for the mood than confused

She sits up and raises her eyebrows and looks at him Going for impressed not confused

 Partial ejaculation technique learned via machines that give us feedback and guide us along nonobvious intermediates to learning it Keltham says Thats the way we do it without magic Do you have a magical solution for the problem where if men have full orgasms they go soft for a while Because I wouldnt mind trying that too if its on tap

 Second circle cleric spell or theres a potion if youre pretty sure your god only gave you useful tothe Project spells today Paladins reportedly get it at first circle but none of them have ever let Carissa observe this firsthand because paladins

 Used up all my second circles for the day and even if my god extrapolated our date he would also know I didnt really need that spell

 So do you have that potion on hand or were you just going to let me empty my full reserve into your mouth and then have nothing to do but service you for a while until I got hard again Because that seems a little naughty

Was she supposed to do something different Would I do that she says innocently Be difficult with you without saying in advance it was Complicated Romance like Im from a civilization of savages We can call for the potion but I havent got it in my ear

He shall delay for later the question of how potions are usually stored in ears Well back to work with you then Keltham says and pulls her head back down Dequote unless you actually did that because you needed a break from oral he adds

 that is the most baffling thing that anyone has ever said to Carissa in her entire life She will simply ignore it

The night is young Maybe dath ilan can still top it

The next time Keltham gets close to an orgasm he pulls her head back By the hair

 I was getting close to a potential orgasm there Keltham says Now in dath ilan a slightly skilled partner not a professional just someone whod put some time and money into improving the pleasures she had to trade would have machine assisted training for reading how close I am to orgasm If she wasnt relatively skilled Id have to expend the distracting effort to say verbal numbers from zero to twelve to tell her how close I was to coming so she could slow down or speed up to keep me at around nine or ten without going to twelve

 So are you slightly skilled by the standards of dath ilan Carissa Sevar

 Said in what would be in dath ilan a naughty male voice but not at all a submissive one

Well shes hardly going to say no even if she has mostly only used the relevant skillset to not herself be taken by surprise a guy can pull out if he wants to do that She raises her eyebrows at Keltham again

 Oh is that not a game they play in Golarion Keeping people in as much pleasure as you can safely give them without sending them over to where it bursts and stops And do they have any other sex games to replace that one or has Golarion just not optimized over sex at all for all that Carissa was talking a good game before no sad thought no sad thoughts until tomorrow If youve never tried that game before I admit Im curious to see the baseline of how well you do without any training Its not like you could make me come all the way if I decided not to

 Keltham can feel that hes not quite doing this right the naughty challenge that hes giving her the dialogue hes emitting feels wrong like he should be more sadistic in his words not just his fingers Theres something deeper and more forceful in him that wants to speak but doesnt know how to express itself Maybe now was when he was supposed to use Eagles Splendour But whatever this impulse is hell analyze it and reflectionize it later In sex of all places youve got to be okay with things not being perfect the first time

Carissa vaguely suspects that you cant solve sex in the same way you cant solve sword fighting the best tactics depend too much on the adversarys tactics Obviously some people are much better than others at swordfighting and at sex but its not something like logic where theres a correct answer with properties no other answer has people have incredible sex with succubi or whatever but they dont all describe the sex being incredible in the same way the way that fleshshaping is in fact mostly described in the same way If she tries to think back on all of the best sex shes ever had it has notably little to do with technique rather than I just wanted it really badly that day or Id never tried that before and that was a perfect way for it to go for the first time

 this seems like not the time to argue this point Plausibly there is no good time to argue that point but right now is a very bad time Soldiers dont play that game much she says Not none though I would bet I could keep up The problem as described doesnt sound that impossible even if in Golarion a guy will normally just tell you to slow down or whatever probably if having sex with Keltham is an important ingredient of a plan to seduce him to Lawful Evil then she can justify the expense of having someone mindread him and telepathically give her cues and probably she is overthinking this and can just imagine he is saying slow down at the point where shed expect a guy to say that and see if that suffices and involve expensive and risky intimate surveillance arrangements only if that fails Yeah Theres a good plan

Dath ilan has no colloquialism for I bet meaning I believe Those words can mean only one thing

Betting

 Oh and what are we betting then

 I have been established to intend to win your shirt I dont know what you want of me that you dont already have

 In the cuddleroom one typically bets asymmetrical sexual services one desires One unreciprocated oral service not to exceed a third hour callable on demand when youre otherwise in cuddleable state would be a standard thing for you to bet against me What manner of sexual service would you demand I bet in return My shirt is one of the only mementos I have of home fitted to my body alone and also it is a legacy of alien technology far beyond your own civilization Even if you bet an entire lifetime of unreciprocated oral it wouldnt be enough for my shirt Like seriously

Literally everything in that category he could possibly name he has already because in descending order of how obvious this should be to him he is from another planet and is in wildly high demand for reasons that have nothing to do with how often he goes down on people he has a dozen suitors even in this highly secure facility and can therefore expect to get away with being as selfish as he likes with at least three or four of them and since all of them know that none are going to object and also obviously any girl who is difficult with Keltham is getting removed from the project and presumably at that point killed

 So I could name terms along those lines she says but I feel obliged to note that a symmetrical bet like that seems very dath ilani very Neutral not even a little bit Evil and relatedly that it does not sound like you named anything that you really desperately want

What Bets are supposed to be fair because thats what makes them say anything meaningful about the bettors probabilities

Keltham sets aside that particular confusion as probably the wrong kind of incredulity theres something serious about Carissas words Not her tone which sounds the same as always but the actual semantic content of them and the fact that shes extending a sexual pause to say it

 You might have a better idea of what Id desperately want sexually than I would The most recently discovered part of my sex drive thats never had a chance to satisfy itself before is something you told me about after all And several times Ive felt like Ive been making some kind of misstep with it which Ive been telling myself is fine for a first discovery of it

 But I dont understand what you mean by saying that a symmetrical bet isnt Evil You bet because you expect to win Maybe some people arent like that in the cuddleroom but I sure am I mean what version of this practice is asymmetrical Evil instead of Neutral

 You cant just mean what that we pick something with even odds and bet an hour of oral one way against two minutes the other way Wouldnt that be less Evil for you even if it was more Evil for me Taking things without giving in return isnt that I mean isnt that a smaller version of Abaddon basically

The part of Keltham that never stops observing himself notices that his voice is questioning possibly frightened more than trying to contradict her Hes lying on a bed looking down at a naked Carissa with her head not very far from his still erect penis and part of him feels like hes standing on a narrow ledge with somebody who might be about to either stabilize him or push him off

 okay first noting that we are very bad at this and next time we should contemplate having sex without translation magic so we cant overthink everything or at least cannot do so contagiously Secondly dont people vary enormously in how much they mind oral sex if at all like specifically among gay men theres lots of people wholl do it without any reciprocation because its so fun in its own right and I dont know how common that is but it seems like an error to treat it as a sort of interchangeable currency when the actual currency is what people mind and its going to vary wildly in those terms Thirdly because I think thats not actually the core thing even though its an ingredient of my confusion

 I am here I am not here because I calculated how much pleasure I could get out of you and how much inconvenience I would be buying it for and in fact came here without any particular expectation that dath liani sex is pleasurable to Chelish people though it does seem to be actually I am here because I want you and part of what it means to want you in the terms I learned insofar as its safe and reasonable and all those other things is to want to put myself in your power and witness what you do with it to strip away every conventional arrangement for how we ought to relate to each other to stop calculating whether its been long enough or fair enough or reciprocated closely enough to emerge whatever you choose to make of me And the difference between us and Abaddon is that I knew what I wanted and came here to do it chose this and chose you in pure selfish curiosity about what youll do with me and where Ill be after that And if your terms arent fair I can walk away if Id like but I can also not walk away if Id like And theres nothing of Abaddon in a bet we both agree to with our eyes open for our own reasons even if it gives you everything and me merely the satisfaction of having that to give you

Well of course theyre having to spend way too much time thinking about things theyre aliens they havent started out with common knowledge established of a sexual protocol

Keltham sets that thought aside too Its bad enough that theyre touching on the meta level he knows better than to say anything as meta meta as to argue about the expected time two aliens should reasonably expect to need to allocate for metalevel discussion And to say it out loud would also be imposing his own frame on things and hes starting to suspect that frame is part of the problem

 Were taught that theres always an exchange one way or another and that we have to acknowledge whatever that exchange is to make sure its a fair one

 If I knew you better or maybe if just understood Chelish people Id already know what you were expecting from me in this in whatever were doing which is something that I dont even understand if were not trading pleasures with each other which I mean some people enjoy the act more than others it doesnt mean that what theyre doing isnt valuable

 I can tell Im in the wrong frame for this new thing that were doing but I was raised among people who werent Evil enough and I dont understand what the really Evil thing to do here is Part of me is fascinated by the idea of you giving me things and you being rewarded only by the satisfaction of giving them to me but wouldnt that make you Good

 Dath ilan sounds lovely but yes Im starting to suspect that them not having invented this is not just about their population rates being off somewhat Hmmm So the usual caveat given about Good and Evil are that they are godconcepts and were working with the human understanding because the gods dont know how to teach us the real thing as much as with Law and Chaos except Good and Evil correspond more to natural human impulses so its both easier to get them mostly right and easier to get them a little wrong

If I decided that I wanted to increase the sum of happiness for others in the world at some cost to my own happiness and that I was going to do this by wandering around giving blowjobs that would be Good I guess Good people dont actually do that probably because there are a lot of better ways

If I decided that the thing I care about for myself isnt happiness isnt even in every context being fairly dealt by but is a certain kind of knowledge of the world or a certain kind of knowledge of myself my limits and my strengths and my weaknesses and which parts of me only know how to interface with Civilization and which parts know different things than that

 then however I go about the pursuit of that Im still Evil because I havent gone and tried to figure out whats best for other people benefitting them is mostly an entertaining side effect with me so far

Obviously even if you were absolutely selfish youd still go around computing what everyone else wanted thats important useful knowledge for fitting into and using the larger multiagent equilibrium

 I think Im following you so far

 Okay So if you were a god youd just go around merrily engaging in exactly and only the set of transactions that cause you to have more of the known fixed thing youwant than you had before or that actually I shouldnt even try to say this part because your civilization talks about it more and will know how to say it better but uh consider me to have attempted to convey that I think you are right about what an Evil god would do

 Not seeing where this is going in relation to sexuality but you should probably just keep talking same as when we first met yesterday and a lifetime ago

 Right

The thing that I think youre into is not that And the transaction model does not work at all Lots of people like it there are known ways to do it better or worse or more dangerously its not resistant to analysis but you cant do it at all by trying to make sure the other persons getting their duly negotiated share of the value being produced you will destroy all the value being produced if you try It runs on Evil emotions let loose in a context where it is safe to let them loose on the power that want has when its not held in check by all the things that have to hold in in check almost every minute of all of the time it runs on from the other end the ways that it changes you for the better to stop looking out for your interests and discover where they fall when you arent protecting them

 and it is unfair sometimes Revels in its unfairness sometimes Giving someone orders that they cannot follow so that you can punish them for failing to follow them is a sex game and it is a fun sex game and I bet youd like it Tying people up and making them while theyre helpless trade you hours of service for sips of water is a sex game a fun sex game and I bet youd like that too Its unfair thats the point but also it isnt unfair because the service and the water arent the actual value being exchanged and divided between the parties and they might in fact have no idea what it is or if theyre dividing it fairly but they both keep coming back for more

Boy howdy betsy booyah is Carissa using some ideas not natural to the conceptual language of dath ilan

When Keltham was very young indeed it was explained to him that if somebody old enough to know better were to deliberately kill somebody Civilization would send them to the Last Resort an island landmass that another world might call Japan and that if Keltham deliberately killed somebody and destroyed their brain Civilization would just put him into cryonic suspension immediately

It was carefully and rigorously emphasized to Keltham in a distinction whose tremendous importance he would not understand until a few years later that this was not a threat It was not a promise of conditional punishment Civilization was not trying to extort him into not killing people into doing what Civilization wanted instead of what Keltham wanted based on a prediction that Keltham would obey if placed into a counterfactual payoff matrix where Civilization would send him to the Last Resort if and only if he killed It was just that if Keltham demonstrated a tendency to kill people the other people in Civilization would have a natural incentive to transport Keltham to the Last Resort so he wouldnt kill any others of their number Civilization would have that incentive to exile him regardless of whether Keltham responded to that prospective payoff structure If Keltham deliberately killed somebody and let their brain soul perish Keltham would be immediately put into cryonic suspension not to further escalate the threat against the more undesired behavior but because hed demonstrated a level of danger to which Civilization didnt want to expose the other exiles in the Last Resort

Because of course if you try to make a threat against somebody the only reason why youd do that is if you believed theyd respond to the threat that intuitively is what the definition of a threat is

Its why Iomedae cant just alter herself to be a kind of god wholl release Rovagug unless Hell gets shut down and threaten Pharasma with that Pharasma and indeed all the other gods are the kinds of entity who will predictably just ignore that even if that means the multiverse actually gets destroyed And then given that Iomedae doesnt have an incentive to release Rovagug or to self modify into the kind of god who will visibly inevitably do that unless placated

Gods and dath ilani both know this and have math for defining it precisely

Politically mainstream dath ilani are not libertarians minarchists or any other political species that the splintered peoples of Golarion would recognize as having been invented by some luminary or another Their politics is built around math that Golarion doesnt know and cant be predicted in detail without that math To a Golarion mortal resisting government on emotional grounds Dont kill people or well send you to the continent of exile and Pay your taxes or well nail you to a cross sound like threats just the same maybe one sounds better intentioned than the other but they both sound like threats Its only a dath ilani or perhaps a summoned outsider forbidden to convey their alien knowledge to mortals wholl notice the part where Civilizations incentive for following the exile conditional doesnt depend on whether you respond to exile conditionals by refraining from murder while the crucifixion conditional is there because of how the government expects Golarionites to respond to crucifixion conditionals by paying taxes There is a crystalline logic to it that is not like yielding to your impulsive angry defiant feelings of not wanting to be told what to do

The dath ilani built Governance in a way more thoroughly voluntarist than Golarion could even understand without math not only because those dath ilani thought threats were morally icky but because they knew that a certain kind of technically defined threat wouldnt be an equilibrium of ideal agents and it seemed foolish and dangerous to build a Civilization that would stop working if people started behaving more rationally

The Taldane word punishment translates into Civilizations conceptual library as a technical concept for a structure that should never appear in reality not just the punishment itself being kept out of reality the threat of punishment is something that shouldnt appear in the actual counterfactuals

So giving someone orders that they cannot follow so you can punish them for failing to follow them doesnt make any sense even assuming the actualization of a counterfactual threat structure because punishment is by technical definition something that appears in threats which if theyre being deployed sanely are meant to work in a way where the naive agent obeys in actual reality and therefore the threatening agent doesnt have to expend resources on carrying out the punishment in actual reality so why would you purposefully give somebody orders they cant follow that doesnt even make sense even in the world where threats work on people

And thats not even getting into the math underlying the dath ilani concepts of fairness If Alis and Bohob both do an equal amount of labor to gain a previously unclaimed resource worth 10 value units and Alis has to propose a division of the resource and Bohob can either accept that division or say they both get nothing and Alis proposes that Alis get 6 units and Bohob get 4 units Bohob should accept this proposal with probability 5 6 so Aliss expected gain from this unfair policy is less than her gain from proposing the fair division of 5 units apiece Conversely if Bohob makes a habit of rejecting proposals less than 6 value units for Bohob with probability proportional to how much less Bohob gets than 6 like Bohob thinks the fair division is 6 Alis should ignore this and propose 5 so as not to give Bohob an incentive to go around demanding more than 5 value units

A good negotiation algorithm degrades smoothly in the presence of small differences of conclusion about whats fair in negotiating the division of gains from trade but doesnt give either party an incentive to move away from what that party actually thinks is fair This indeed is what makes the numbers the parties are thinking about be about the subject matter of fairness that theyre about a division of gains from trade intended to be symmetrical as a target of surrounding structures of counterfactual actions that stabilize the fair way of looking things without blowing up completely in the presence of small divergences from it such that the problem of arriving at negotiated prices is locally incentivized to become the problem of finding a symmetrical Schelling point

 You wouldnt think youd be able to build a civilization without having invented the basic math for things like that the way that coordination actually works at all in real world interactions as complicated as figuring out how many apples to trade for an orange And in fact having been tossed into Golarion or similar places one sooner or later observes that people do not in fact successfully build civilizations that are remotely sane or good if they havent grasped the Law governing basic multiagent structures like that

Sex games built around punishment and unfairness huh

Keltham has never heard anything this baffling in his entire life

 And since this improvised cuddleroom doesnt even have a whiteboard not that Keltham was the sort of dath ilani who needed a whiteboard in his cuddleroom in his past life but it was hardly uncommon there is absolutely no hope that he is going to be able to explain any of his bewilderment even if he tries

He has zero viable options except to ignore this for now and move on

 Youre invoking fundamental concepts in the possibilities of multiagent interaction that I thought I understood but youre using them in ways that I cant understand at all Keltham says his voice quieter than it usually is I dont think we should try to talk about them tonight Leaving all of that aside how would you suggest I behave towards you now if Im to actualize this part of my sexuality in a way that would work for most people who had it

What part of that could possibly

 How about you act like yesterday we had an elaborate and extended eight hours of me doing exactly as I pleased and negotiated in exchange that tonight you get eight hours of doing exactly as you please with me which by default already includes demanding as much unreciprocated whatever youd like as you want such that thats a silly thing to offer to further negotiate and that I have made such arrangements many many times in the past and know myself not to be vulnerable to being damaged by them so you dont need to worry about whether Im actually really all right and if you can think about it without exploding you can contemplate that the thing Im in fact getting in exchange is not specifically the exact same thing some other time but that it is satisfactory to me and doesnt involve you doing anything nice for me now or later

Again that sense of standing on a narrow ledge and not being sure whether Carissa is trying to stabilize him or push him off it

 I youre right that theres a part of me that wants that wants it a lot and I keep wanting to say that its like being offered a an apple for free without paying for it who wouldnt want it except that I can tell its more sexual than that and deeper and darker and maybe dangerous but but how is it okay How is it all right with you I keep wanting to check that youre not expecting more equity or the rights to the fasteners in my shirt or but you sound like youve done this with other sex partners it seems so so valuable to give that to somebody if you didnt charge for it at all even in nonfinancial ways then there should be many many more people wanting it then people wholl supply it and I dont understand and yes I know it shouldnt be something I need to figure out to have the sex itself but it doesnt feel safe to grab something so precious and scarce whose scarcity has to be rationed somehow without knowing why I get it when not everyone gets it because that reason whatever it is is the price

 Lit factor that varies to equilibrate supply demand in Baseline but unfortunately this more technical and general term has just translated right back into price in Taldane

 I think its pretty balanced actually in supply and demand Cheliax has philosophy about parts of yourself you discover through pain through obedience through not having choices Some people hear that and think well that sounds false of me or try it and its false of them but but its true of lots of people about as many as there are people who discover something in themselves through sadism itd be neat for me if I were offering you something very precious you could otherwise stalk half the world looking for even with all your money but if you ask the class in the morning youll have three volunteers She mentally considers the girls in the class youll have five but three who know for sure theyre into it This would be overconfident if she didnt have the power to order the girls in the class to not ALL VOLUNTEER FOR KELTHAM TO TORTURE THEM HE WONT THINK THATS PLAUSIBLE

That sexual markets equilibrium makes no sense to him but Carissa thinks it makes sense to her and maybe that should be enough

Keltham can tell that he wants this

Keltham can tell that hes afraid

Without any sense of hesitation Keltham looks within himself for further details this being the obvious thing one is trained to do next in that cognitive situation

Hes afraid that hell do this wrongly if he tries to do it and not give Carissa what she expects in return because there must be something even if she doesnt understand what it is or just make a misstep that she isnt expecting because hes an alien and she wont forgive him and Chelish Governance will decide that the alien is too dangerous to have this kind of sex with and hell never again get the thing he just discovered

 Thats not realistic says the wiser part of himself individuals can be unreasonably unforgiving but whole governments know better

Hes scared of betraying a thing that it means to be Keltham that he does pay fairly what he owes

 Theres limits to what fairness demands of you when somebody has insisted to you repeatedly that a good is being given to you without reciprocal obligation

Hes scared that

Keltham smiles for he sees the humor in the situation though he doesnt know if Carissa will find it humorous at all

 Well I just got an interesting answer from my mind when I asked it why I was scared of something I knew I wanted Apparently I really dont want to disappoint you by missing some key requirement on my performance that youre not thinking to mention and then youll never offer me this again Apparently even if three other women here offer it to me Im attached to getting it from you in particular I have no idea how youll take that but it seemed like the sort of thing I ought to let you know

Carissa has not encountered that level of being emotionally vulnerable at someone on purpose presumably its on purpose since she was eight and another child told her that their dad died yesterday as if they expected sympathy for this She corrected them by saying cheerfully you look it you have a dead dad face and then when the kid merely looked confused like if I were your dad I would die of how stupid your face looks This got the message across and Carissa does not think the kid even said it to anyone else and got beaten for it so really she was doing him a favor

 anyway So far I have found all your miscommunications very endearing I think I will enjoy watching you get better at this even if you are very bad at it starting out And its doing it more wrong to want it and do something else you arent actually avoiding doing it wrong that way

 Havent actually noticed that internal phenomenon with any other women before I suppose it requires respecting somebody to some noticeable degree inflicting sexy pain on her and then having her offer herself up to me like like yeah my language doesnt have a word for it And here I thought I was just aromantic ha ha I wonder if Civilization has a secret effort underway to cure people like me out of existence or just try to make sure we have fewer kids so our descendants wont be running around needing something that dath ilan can never give us

asexual was doesnt actually do sex aromantic is doesnt actually do romance

Is he Saying that he is falling in love

Well that was one of the objectives so good job on that objective Carissa Are such declarations accompanied by snuggles It seems like maybe they should be She will stop leaning over him and curl herself in at his side Seems to me like they should go the other way she says And find their few Chelish girls they cant have none with a billion people and tell them they have something special I guess maybe they dont notice if theres no one telling them and if the schools dont do pain for lessons either

He snuggles back

 I hope youre right but they wouldnt expect people like that to exist how would people notice nobody would do those experiments the people themselves might just think they were insane for wanting to be hurt no The people smarter than I am would figure it out Somehow Theres a million people in dath ilan at the thousandth fractile in what Owls Wisdom enhances not just the Keepers but the people who could become that and choose not to Maybe it only takes one of those whos the thing that you are to realize what they are in detail And then theyd encourage painseekers to have more children and paingivers to have less children until it all came into balance unless the people who knew just thought that it was adding more pain to the world and that Civilization would be better off without the whole thing

Sad thoughts Not for tonight

 But thats not my business any more Keltham says firmly more to himself than to her it helps to say it out loud to have others know the standard to which you intend to hold yourself My business is not in dath ilan which has that one problem but in Golarion which has all of the other problems except for that one

 Well now Im going to have to try to think of another problem we dont have if you dont distract me Attempted translation across the alien communications barrier that was an invitation to distract me

 I intend to Very shortly Hes gone soft erectionwise and itll be slightly harder to regain after one partial ejaculation but when his options for gaining arousal include inflicting pain on Carissa Sevar he is confident that getting his erection back will not be even slightly a problem I check explicitly Most dath ilani women if they werent being paid in other ways would consider themselves owed an orgasm during sex Unless they were deliberately practicing near orgasmic only sex in order to increase or conserve their sex drive and then theyd want you to work on getting them to near orgasm as a signal of of a concept you dont have but respect is close to it To show that you werent trying to go off the boundary of fairness

 I consider myself owed nothing though with intent to acquire some things if youre not clever enough to stop me

 I cant tell if youre talking about masturbating or stealing my shirt and in the latter case Ill say again that it is MY SHIRT and I consider that part to be SERIOUS BUSINESS

 Sorry I will not steal your shirt I will not ambiguously joke about stealing your shirt I will spend my next paycheck on Sleeves of Many Garments and then inexplicably from your perspective have your shirt but not in a way that deprives you of it

 Good Im an easy man to get along with if you dont yoink my stuff see

 I part of me is attracted to just not owing you anything but part of me would have liked to not give you pleasure inflict it on you like it was pain

 But either my dath ilani training assumes the other woman is also a dath ilani when it comes to reading her accurately or I dont know the key code to your sex lock You were making sounds that would correspond to a dath ilani woman having the amount of fun Id expect from the techniques I was using But the training Ive done for reading things like muscle tension and exact details of breathing for purposes of pulling off the trick of keeping a woman right around orgasm without going over and without her needing to be distracted by giving me deliberate feedback which is another dath ilani trick I was planning to surprise you with was reading as if you were at the same low constant arousal level regardless of what techniques I tried on you Even if what I was doing was working and I just couldnt tell Im not sure I can get you to orgasm at all let alone keep you in near orgasmic pleasure for a while if I cant tell how well anything is working we dont have any prior protocols established for more deliberate feedback cycles and also I dont have a vibrating thing or any other sextech

Whats an explanation thats not oh I was really hoping I could just fake it And not yeah thats Chelish girls unreadable which itd now be her responsibility to coordinate everyone on that Which seems hard Its its the same problem they ran into earlier right Keltham pulling apparently magical correlations out of nowhere because his society shelves entirely different things alongside each other and not actually I really dislike experiencing pleasure which isnt even true but feels kind of true right now and not oh that was my badly behaved unsexy body double

Why is her life LIKE this

As few lies as possible Only she doesnt even know what the relatively fewer lies route from here is because they are standing in a LIE MINEFIELD

 this is the way a stupid failure who gets executed a week from now thinks not the way that the girl Asmodeus noticed thinks calm focus good lies are personal therefore nondisprovable Good lies expose vulnerability because people dont expect vulnerable lies and because if you know what someone thinks your vulnerabilities are youre safer

Snuggle Thats on me not on you I think I was enjoying myself but its hard for me to relax enough to get off when I dont feel like I understand handwave whats going on If its safe for me to stop tracking things Its not actually safe to stop tracking things very often at the Worldwound And uh it Is physically much safer here but its also very confusing I am curious whether youll have this problem with anyone else but my guess now is that you wont and it is just that I am too on edge and need to relax

The invisible inaudible security wizard who is reading Sevars mind and laughing his head off temporarily pauses his laughter in a sign of due respect that recovery was legitimately smoother than he was expecting Sevar to pull off

Hes also resolving to never ever sleep with this woman no matter what she waves in front of him but thats likewise a sign of respect

Keltham hugs Carissa closer to himself Its an honest reaction of course hes not going to start faking things that would be a sign something had gone dreadfully wrong with an equilibrium if people acted fake in that way then Carissa would be expecting the fakery and if they dont then hes not going to be first to defect etcetera Keltham is moved and feeling empathetic suffering as one would expect what with Carissas story being more awful than anything youd almost ever hear in dath ilan where the news coverage tries to be statistically representative of how often things happen in reality

But Keltham is also concealing another thought one that seems not especially helpful to speak right now which is about the way that Carissa made sexual sounds despite her low objective arousal It blatantly rhymes with the Permanent Cheerfulness he is beginning to suspect it is not dignity of his students

There is Keltham is beginning to suspect a kind of damage to the self that nonpsychiatrists like himself have never heard of maybe a kind of damage that approximately doesnt exist in dath ilan something like an illusion spell something like the Eagles Splendor spell something that unglues seemings from actualities Keltham suspects he intuits that the ungluing isnt just in the outer social world its not like a lie told to other people it reaches deep into peoples own selves It is a form of damage that dath ilani mental training protects against so thoroughly that he was never warned against it as a danger or maybe its a socially inflicted hazard that requires your society to be doing everything wrong simultaneously

Fighting endless demons at the Worldwound and that making you tense to the point where you have a hard time getting off during sex even after you leave well yes thats bad or even grimdark but its the ordinary kind of grimdark you would see in a movie or novel out of dath ilan The thing where you make noises like youre fine that seems very very very much worse in ways that Keltham is finding hard to describe That cannot possibly be something that would not damage a person nor a thing that an undamaged person would do

 he wants to find whatever did this to Carissa and unmake it

Ha Keltham has never felt that way about another person before It isnt limerence Keltham doesnt think it doesnt feel like descriptions hes read of limerence More like he owns equity in Sevar or or he doesnt even know

Hes supposed to set aside sad thoughts like this but Keltham can feel that he should not do so that quickly The current running through him now is deep not lightly to be told to go away and come back later Still he can at least not say any such things out loud If his Carissa is broken and doesnt know it he shouldnt ask about that or try to explain his hypothesis to her in the middle of sex under previously decided meta policy it should not be said tonight at all

 I may need a half minute to recover Keltham says out loud Im afraid that I went and updated about how awful Golarion is again and I definitely needed to go there because otherwise I would have been too confused specifically during sex but still

What in that could possibly have been an update

 Take as long as you need

A brief smile Ill aspire to need as little as possible A saying out of dath ilan First learn correctness then comes speed

 A saying that works here too I dont think Ive heard it but if I did I wouldnt guess at all itd be invented by aliens

 Interesting How about If you know where youre going you should already be there

 somewhat more invented by aliens I know where Im going usually means Im pleased with my afterlife arrangements and if they turn out to be dated to today then so be it but its not advised to run straight off to Hell just because youre supposed to get there eventually

 Ha No thats not what it means in dath ilan at all Its the second discipline of speed which is fourteenth of the twenty seven virtues reflecting a shard of the Law of Probability that Ill no doubt end up explaining later but Im not trying it here without a whiteboard

 As a human discipline If you know your destination you are already there is a self fulfilling prediction about yourself that if you can guess what youre going to realize later you have already realized it now The idea in this case would be something like because mental qualities do not have intrinsic simple inertia in the way that physical objects have inertia there is the possibility that if we had sufficiently mastered the second layer of the virtue of speed we would be able to visualize in detail what it would be like to have recovered from our mental shocks and then just be that For myself thatd be visualizing where Ill already be in half a minute For yourself though this would be admittedly harder itd be visualizing what it would be like to have recovered from the Worldwound Maybe we could just immediately rearrange our minds like that because mental facts dont have the same kinds of inertia as physical objects especially if we believe about ourselves that we can move that quickly

 I of course cannot actually do that and have to actually take the half a minute But knowing that Id be changing faster if I was doing it ideally is something I can stare at mentally and then change faster because we do have any power at all to change through imagining other ways we could be even if not perfectly Another line of that verse goes You can move faster if youre not afraid of speed

 You seemed to think that the first layer of speed made perfect sense so I thought Id go try the second layer on you Though that may have been a little ambitious now that Im actually saying out loud what all goes into layer two

 huh I think that might not be true until youve learned some other things for changing your mind around I bet its true for devils

 Layer three is imaginary intelligence is real intelligence and it means that if you can imagine the process that produces a correct answer in enough detail you can just use the imaginary answer from that in real life because it doesnt matter what simulation layer an answer comes from The classic exercise to develop the virtue is to write a story featuring a character whos much smarter than you so you can see what answers your mind produces when you try to imagine what somebody much smarter than you would say If those answers are actually better it means that your own model of yourself contains stupidity assertions places where you believe about yourself that you reason in a way which is incorrect or just think that your brain isnt supposed to produce good answers such that when you instead try to write a fictional character much smarter than you your own actual brain which is whats ultimately producing those answers is able to work unhindered by your usual conceptions of the ways in which you think that youre a kind of person stupider than that

 Huh I have not tried my hand at writing fiction but I would be really surprised if I had that problem One thing I like about wizards is that they are very very focused on being as smart as possible and getting as much out of your intelligence as possible and if there were a widespread phenomenon of people failing on some level to use all their intelligence which you could notice once you enhanced Wisdom or Cunning theres no way everyone wouldntve known that

 Yeah lets try that again after all yall hear a remotely Lawful definition of what intelligence is

 I was wondering before if maybe the permanently cheerful students in the classroom are trying to imagine the version of themselves thats cheerful and act like that person in hopes of being that person Because when were being instructed in the virtue of speed were told that you can try that like once or three times to see if anything improves But if you kept it up itd be like They probably dont have artificial flavors here Using Prestidigitation to flavor all your food if Prestidigitation worked perfectly for that to the point where flavors were uncorrelated from actual nutrients and your body became confused in the way that it tried to seek nutrients by seeking flavors associated with those nutrients Fake cheerfulness until its real is something youd try a few times to learn how it helped if it helped Not a good way of splinting a bone long term to help it heal It wouldnt heal straight Or at least that was the standard dath ilani advice to a standard dath ilani person in my intelligence bracket But artificial cheerfulness meant to become real probably isnt the explanation for the permanent cheerfulness thing because if it was they could have just said so

Thats about the best veiled helpful advice Keltham can offer relative to the obvious possible reason why Carissa might be imitating all the sexual responses of a person who hadnt just gotten back from the Worldwound

Carissa has picked up that theres subtext but isnt sure enough of what it is to be sure she can handle it cautiously enough I dont think thats it exactly Or that kind of thing might be an ingredient in the advice that people get But our wisdom doesnt get passed down split up like that into standard advice by intelligence bracket We get told this thing tends to work better than this other thing and not why everyone thinks so But youll still do better by listening to the wisdom than not even if youd do even better if the wisdom was all split up and separately justified and you could figure out which pieces are applicable

Well that doesnt overtly sound like she picked up the subtext so either she actually didnt pick up the subtext hypothesis 1 maybe because his theory of what she was trying to do was completely offbase hypothesis 1 1 or maybe itll delayed drop on her later hypothesis 1 2 or alternatively she got it but doesnt want to talk about it now so is concealing that she got it hypothesis 2 Either way he should move on

 The Baseline way of thinking this hypothesis tree makes it clear that the branches are not exhaustive meaning theres an implicit hypothesis 1 0 all other branches of 1 that is neither 1 1 nor 1 2

Keltham checks in with his sexuality His sexuality is not he thinks really all that hindered by the thought of the grimdark thing that happened to Carissa the desire to protect her is weirdly close in mindspace to the desire to have pain inflicting sex with her The reason the mood could be that fragile is because of the other impediments still going on

 I checked in with my sexuality again now that my brain had four half two minutes to rest Keltham says The tendency to underestimate required temporal resources is so ubiquitous that even in dath ilan people who dont want to spend infinity mental labor hours on doing better will just live with their embarrassing darned underestimates It still wants to hurt you and have sex with you and try out paying nothing back which I guess this is a good time for nope major inner pushback on that Some part of me is not okay with the prospect of not knowing your sex passcode and not being able to inflict pleasure on you when I feel like it It wants to run off and build a hugely overpowered magical vibrating thing to brute force your sex passcode I dont actually know whats going on in my head right now Do you know whats going on in there

 My top guess would be your conception of what it means to have power over a girl includes you can get her off so it doesnt really feel like having me if you cant Other guesses your concept of why its okay to hurt me is because I like it rather than because I want it and so my liking ended up tangled in your core concept of why this is a fun thing to do and it doesnt feel fun if you dont feel like Im liking it properly I dont suppose it fixes this if I assure you its very very pleasant just not in a getting off way

 I think much more the first thing I dont actually understand why its okay to hurt you Im just pushing ahead anyways because you said so But my sense of having you and that depending on being able to inflict pleasure on you

 My brain is claiming both that youre obviously correct and also that it has no idea what you could mean by that which is an odd and embarrassing set of stances to hold simultaneously

 I am referencing arrangements that people want and that can be good for them and that I am nearly certain dath ilan doesnt have and wouldnt even understand and I expect trying to explain will take hours and trip on all our previous confusions about how governments work but I can try if you want

 For now I should only need to know which final answer you think is right for how I should treat you and feel about you while Im doing that in order to have you Part of me must almost understand it or I wouldnt know there was something I wanted Maybe you dont need to explain why the answer is correct just make me understand what the answer is or the fraction of it thats about me right now Frankly itd probably help his bewildered sexuality quite a bit if he had the sixhour lecture or just imagine a textbook But time is a finite resource Youre making progress Carissa Sevar Im less confused than I was an hour earlier I just havent heard enough that my need to inflict pleasure snaps into place as an obvious element of having you

 Having something means you can do as you like with it What makes having a person different from having a big wax doll of them is that they experience you doing as you like with them So its not very satisfactory to have a person and not have the ability to cause them to have whatever experiences you wish them to its like how it also wouldnt be nearly as good if I could turn off or modulate all sensory input I got You should assume that those things are yours not mine to decide and barriers to you having those things are problems to solve though not necessarily problems you want to solve tonight

 That feels like another small bit of my sexuality just slid into place Its phrased in a worrying way but Keltham cant put his finger on how else it ought to be phrased instead and Carissa sure has emphasized that this is what she wants His sexuality also seems more cheerful about continuing with sex in the face of this is a problem to be solved later rather than this cant be a problem because demanding women be aroused by you is not how sane relationships work What would you guess Im supposed to feel while Im having you making you experience what I want you to experience Its not infinitely safe to tell me what I should feel but Im guessing that its much safer than giving similar advice to a Chelish man my age Civilization ran me through a lot of exercises on not feeling something untrue to myself just because somebody primed me in the wrong direction

 powerful Thats why its interesting at all right she has no idea how tyranny would translate to Baseline and doesnt want to risk it but this is clearly the thing her tutor possesses and she doesnt the ability to find Asmodeus here the dimension along which Keltham can be tempted except he couldnt learn it from someone else who experiences it he has to learn it from someone who can look him in the eyes and sincerely tell him that some people are meant to be ruled over that she would know that your wants are law that the only thing you have to think about is how youd like things to be

Not quite right somehow Keltham thinks But its close enough that he can maybe see what his mind is trying to feel

 You talked about giving yourself to me to see what I made of you can you say another few words about that

 There are lots of different kinds of devils And some of them are painful to become from a human shaped start not the way exercise is painful the way being whipped is painful and Ive wanted that since I first heard it was an option I want to bathe in a flame that hurts me but does not damage me and emerge perfected I want to suffer and survive and know things about myself from the surviving I want to let go of all the things I cling to as I try to keep the world under my control and learn what happens without them And I want to watch people transformed by power over me I want to see what they grow into when I am the raw material they get to use for growing I know that I will survive anything Keltham I think no one in your world has ever really had that And since I will survive anything I want to endure lots of things And you youre already remaking how I think what I see what I want I want to see what you do with me I want to learn how I emerge from it

 Thats the way you feel about this is too far from any way my own mind works for me to understand I think though its helping on some level to know that you have an experience that makes sense to you

 You can be damaged even if you cant be annihilated Isnt it still a big deal if I manage to screw up on a level that damages you Even if its only for the rest of your preafterlife existence Im sorry I know on some level that Im asking questions whose answers from you should already be obvious that Im denying the frame and making you repeat yourself but maybe I need to hear it anyways

Well seems like the devil bit went over okay That was the highest priority here

 so several things First I think you probably actually cant damage me for the rest of my preafterlife existence I recognize Id be more credible on this front if I didnt apparently have some kind of Worldwound related trauma but Ive been there for six years and Ill be astonished if I have trouble relaxing for a month And thats you know watching my friends eaten by demons in front of me and so on not getting hurt Second Im worried youre still reaching too much for a trade frame Which is maybe my fault for telling you what I like I am not trading you the right to do whatever you want for hopefully its a satisfactorily compelling experience for me and if not Ill wish I hadnt made the trade I am giving you the right because I have it and so I have the right to give it away to do whatever youd like If I wanted a very specific range of things to happen to me I could hire my own damn sex worker You dont owe me me not getting damaged because you dont owe me anything and I am not really honestly not trying to sneak in some little things you owe me around the sides Its would it work any better to say its an experiment I am doing with myself and if the result of that experiment is damage then Id rather have damage happen like when youre testing artillery you dont want the test to miraculously come out no damage you want the test to accurately reflect field conditions

Thirdly its common to order someone to tell you if they think theyre past what they can handle Not because youre obliged to stop not because youre obliged to care at all but because you as the person doing exactly as you please might like more information to aid you in doing exactly as you please

That also doesnt sound quite right but like its near the thing that is right But he sure isnt going to start rolling his own nonstandard safety protocols at this stage of his ignorance Consider yourself so ordered

 Six years at the Worldwound

Maybe she should actually do it just so hes reassured that she can depends how things go she decides Possibly it hasnt even occurred to him that she might not want to tell him

What if they stop having this conversation and go back to having sex Can she achieve that

She bows her head and looks up at him Yes Keltham she says

He can feel Carissas words hitting that part of him that wants to have her not just have sex with her waking it up again and Keltham does his best to walk past all the little pleadings in his mind that everything be much better understood before he proceeds further Civilization does do its best to give people experience in needing to do things that are not carefully arranged they have overthought everything far too much to miss such obvious ways they could be making their children weak

He is already remaking her so shes told him with his knowledge and she is someone who desires to be remade it at least lets him understand why she might give herself to him at all it helps him understand how there could be a sensible price and have it be one that he can pay No thats not a frame he can step out of so easily even after being told to he does not comprehend yet where he could stand instead

Keltham does manage not to disclaim out loud that he probably cant remake her with sex yet She knows that She knows hes only taking his first steps

Shes told him over and over to stop worrying so much about her side of things to worry about his side of things what he wants And for somebody whose Thing is supposedly Selfishness it sure is funny how thats such a hard instruction for him to not even follow just visualize in correct and plausible detail what it means how it could be There is some unquiescent desire within his mind something hes supposed to do to make it okay for him to only worry about himself afterwards some reassurance that he needs or procedure to follow but he does not know what

He can go on anyway Civilization also teaches that art among its others Continuation the first layer of the twenty second virtue of Perseverance

Keltham reaches out a hand to touch Carissas head brushing a strand of hair away from her face

 Part of him notes its strange that shed have long hair while fighting demons but he did directly see that aspect the giant things right when he showed up its not a likely place to catch a deception Its not like Carissa said she fought demons by punching them maybe for magic fighting hair length doesnt matter

He wants to ask if Carissa is ready but its the wrong move a move not about what he wants she keeps on trying to tell him to focus on his own desires Still part of him wants so much to check to hear a word telling him its safe to continue

Try it Try it the way she says just once If she says he got it horribly wrong he can undo it

 Hold still until I tell you that you can move again Keltham says with only a slight break in his voice

Awwwwww hes trying and thats the wrong attitude to have entirely

 there is something important in this There is something important to Asmodeus in power and obedience even the little broken versions of it that humans practice and it is her job to help Keltham see it and thats not cute at all its important its part of the path to perfection

 she watches him and doesnt move

Carissa doesnt speak doesnt move though her eyes follow him and it feels correct the same way that hurting her felt correct that he said what to do and she did it

 There are so many obvious ways a system like that could go wrong

Brain stop it There is something here he needs to learn

Keltham runs his hands over Carissa trying to imagine that shes a good or service he just bought It doesnt feel right any more than imagining her as a doll What does it mean to have someone To control her experiences To do what he wants with her

Sex alone doesnt feel like enough somehow especially if he cant fuck her Oral the kind of oral that Keltham has ever heard of cant be satisfyingly forceful in the same way as fucking He does in fact want to fuck Carissa properly that is a thing he wants but he doesnt want to have children tonight Well theoretically he could decide that he trusts in Carissa enough to believe that shell use contraception if she says so but trust decisions are not to be made in heat

He could hurt her But part of Keltham is terrified that if he just pinches Carissas nipples again shell feel bored or unimpressed because thats what he did last time No thats not how she advised him to think but when that fear signal doesnt go quiet after a gentle nudge he deems it unwise to silence it more forcibly than that He just needs to think of something else to do besides pinching her again and if he cant well then if shes unimpressed with his creativity it will be correctly so

Kelthams roving eyes light on Carissas armpit hairs Civilization has mastered biochemical control of hair Keltham himself doesnt have hair anywhere he doesnt want to Most women of dath ilan do elect to switch off hair in armpits Civilization tries to avert certain kinds of status appearance contests that can only have a few winners and many losers but everyone getting a simple treatment to choose their hair pattern is hardly that He does see why a supermajority of Civilizations women would choose that now It doesnt look good on Carissa in his own decision and choice

Keltham reaches down wraps a single long armpit hair around his forefinger and pinches it between his forefinger and thumb and then rips it out

Women in Golarion do not shave their body hair

 Thats not entirely true Golarion is a planet and has lots and lots of civilizations in it and in some of them women rip hair out with tar and in some of them concubines are shaved in the baths before being presented to princes and theres probably some of that even in Cheliax but Carissa hasnt encountered it

Its painful and surprising and surprisingly painful but shes mostly just confused Which is fine when your orders are to hold still you can be as confused as youd like while holding still She isnt sure what Keltham is aiming for She has maybe succeeded in teaching Keltham that he doesnt need to tell her what hes aiming for and he neednt have her in mind for it Great job Carissa lets hope you can handle what you have wrought

 I think Id like you better without armpit hair Keltham says in a lower voice than usual for him I am ordering you to tell me if its valuable in any way to a wizard or if you have strong negative feelings about that and then Ill decide what to do about that

 I feel you should have your girls how you like them Wizards dont need hair

His left hand trails gently through her head hair Its not smooth like head hair tends to be in Civilization for both men and women it feels rougher to his hands but that he doesnt know how to change at all without basic research and going an unknown long way up the tech ladder Maybe magic and money can do it if you have those without it costing time or thinking

His right hand gathers up more armpit hairs For now he says softly this is as close as I know how to come to remaking you the way I want with pain He yanks hard

She feels that inappropriate tothe situation burst of emotion again fondness and protectiveness and Carissa if you catch feelings every serious person in Cheliax will laugh at you while they put you to death

She holds still

 Stand down part of his brain thats now obsessively worrying about whether Carissa was damaged at the Worldwound in some way that makes this the exact wrong thing to do to her and shes not telling him about it because Permanent Cheerfulness

Keltham can tell that hes forcing himself to some degree acting a role like in a LARP and not just acting on his own impulses On standard wisdom he should not do too much of that especially on his first time doing the thing doing it without enjoying it will not train his brain well

You can try a little to enjoy something though if you dont try too hard Why did he want to hurt Carissa again

His thoughts go back to when Carissa propositioned him at lunch today He wanted her then because she was a pretty older woman who seemed probably more experienced throwing herself at him in a way that Keltham had never quite experienced before she seemed like a challenge and he wanted to rise to her From that comes sexual attraction in the way of a challenger not just wanting to have sex with her but to win at sex against her

And even before hed quite understood her as somebody whod spent six years on Worldwound emergency response watching friends get their mortal bodies eaten by demons and remaining amazingly unhurt looking from outside apparently because thats just the standard here even before that hed noticed that she was successfully navigating the planet of Golarion where nothing made any sense

From that comes respect From that respect and sexual attraction the desire to have her From that respect also the appreciation of the value of the gift she gave him by presenting herself to him like this

Some of the sense of forcing himself fades the sense of just acting as he winds up another fingerful of armpit hair tenderly and then yanks it out hard

And the desire to inflict pain He doesnt know yet it doesnt make that kind of sense Controlling her experiences Having her Someday knowing how to shape her like this through pain feels like something she wants more than he does right now but maybe hell get it later

It is resisting analysis into internal parts and internal causes for now and thats okay for now inflicting pain and pleasure on Carissa Sevar is notyet reduced ly sexual

 Baseline does not have any simple phrase that means irreducible in the territory and not just a map only a word that means not reduced inthe map yet

Carissa would really like to react to this in any way It feels like the sort of thing for which a reaction is warranted an affectionate one laying her head in his lap or something However she is in fact deadly serious about not disobeying orders as long as he doesnt try to order her to tell him the truth about Cheliax or something and she does not move at all

Powerful she said he should feel that his word was regulation His literalness objects to that last part as making any sense as a good thing regulations are coordination burdens But he can guess what she was driving at

Powerful he doesnt quite feel he is too uncertain of himself now She has too much real advantage in this relationship in a world he doesnt know surrounded by her own people while he is among strangers

But there is a way he does feel is only beginning to feel a sense of freedom that he could do anything he wants with this pretty and sexual creature and not worry about how to pay it back at least in the short term hes got to pay her back in one money or another but hes already given her valuable knowledge so brain would you please stand down about that for now

He can do anything he wants with this pretty and sexual creature the alien who gave herself to him Carissa Sevar

 Im going to switch to your other armpit now to keep it symmetrical along the way in case I feel like stopping in the middle Keltham says Its harder to reach that armpit from here Move around however you like just make sure you go on presenting your other armpit to me

Why is that command the one thats almost instantly making him more erect than before more turned on

Oh all right she will arrange herself in his lap then

 arrange herself how exactly

With her head in his lap and her arm tucked behind her head so he can continue his work obviously

Kelthams lap also contains an additional biological object of considerable current significance As a male with a primary anatomical sexual focus never far from his mind Carissas head going anywhere near there will generate a lot of attention on where exactly her head is positioned relative to it if its touching tangentially whether or not her hair is drifting around and providing light stimulation etcetera

Yes thats the whole reason to put your head in someones lap light stimulation that is sometimes a little bit plausibly deniable though in this case it really isnt

Keltham does spend a few more cognitive cycles than usual on trying to figure out how purposeful is that he can now feel her hair slightly moving but nothing else if it was dath ilan he wouldnt have to question the deliberateness at all but Golarion is weird Is it meant as a tease

Maybe its meant as a way of saying that if he wants more he needs to ask for order for it

Keltham rips out more of Carissas other armpits hair while he thinks aiming for symmetry on round one with that mix of gentleness and fierceness that he suspects is part of the Larger Thing Is Carissa reacting in any interesting ways to that

The problem with REACTING TO THINGS which is in general the core skill of having sex is that Keltham is apparently anticipating certain reacting tothings correlates and will be very confused and concerned if the reactions have the wrong correlates This is probably less true for pain but only probably Carissa is very upset about this one of the most fun things about sex is rewarding people for their touch with satisfying motions and sounds and she has no idea how to produce the correctly correlated ones instead of the ones that feel like the appropriate reward She is settling for underreacting letting herself twitch and shudder only a very little bit

Keltham will read these more understated reactions as probably not faking it to herself hopefully and demon fighters have high pain tolerance go figure combined with not being sure how much its supposed to hurt in the first place to rip out armpit hairs He wants to ask Carissa exactly where it stands on a dolor scale or order her to say what shes feeling thinking during this But that order doesnt feel like it fits well it fits him it fits what he wants but it doesnt fit the image she constructed for how to do this new thing called Evil

The way that shes holding her arm in place though keeping herself exposed to the pain like shes reaffirming the gift of herself and the obedience that part is working for him By the time he finishes making this armpit symmetrical with the other one he thinks hes going to be more than ready to well the notions of use her or take from her do seem right even though the notion of her as an already bought good or service doesnt

 There are so many things he wants to check if hes doing right But Keltham is making headway on telling his mind to stand down about generating infinitely many urgent questions while having sex Keltham is not the first dath ilani ever to have encountered that issue and Civilization has turned some attention to making sure the species doesnt die out because of it He can just use the standard trick of promising himself that hell write up an after action report and submit it to Carissa for review later while theyre not having sex

In due time Carissas armpit looks symmetrical with her other one the hair somewhat diminished and what remains is going to be easier with a tweezers if that technology exists here

He would like to have access to Carissas own genitals while she orally services him so that he can inflict at least a little pleasure on her she did say it was still pleasant as well as pain but Keltham cannot visualize how that is supposed to work on a flat soft surface like this socalled bed Being able to get into positions like that is why cuddlerooms have furniture that is correctly and appropriately designed for cuddlerooms Maybe if Carissa turned sideways his arms would be able to reach but sideways is not a good position for oral given the sensitivity distribution on penises in general and his penis in particular Unless Carissa has a spell to turn her mouth sideways inside her face He doesnt want to stop and ask right now

 Time for a game Keltham says He has to push himself to overcome the sensation that its wrong to speak out loud that speaking breaks the spell that everything should be done nonverbally the two of them dont have enough of a signaling code worked out Well play a beginners version of it modified for this dimension Youll take me in your mouth and when I get close enough to orgasm to start to feel the heat Ill start counting out loud If I fall down below that burn Ill stop counting and start over when you get back If you go too far Ill partially ejaculate into your mouth and then hurt you and that also starts the count over again If you reach a count of sixty that means its time to make me come If you can do that before I get tired of the game and order you to make me come anyways you get to try on my shirt briefly under my supervision and then give it back

 If you didnt understand that I order you to ask questions And dont look cheerful and enthusiastic about any parts you had trouble understanding unless you actually feel that way

 I am pretty sure I understood that

 Then make it so

Keltham has no idea what hes doing and its terrifying but he also knows how to give very specific instructions Carissa is incredibly into very specific instructions Shes also into horrible mind games where you never know the rules but she gets enough of that in her day job honestly at least right at this moment and so the very specific instructions are incredibly reassuring by comparison

Shes not supposed to express any improperly correlated feelings but she does vaguely try to get that across That she feels safe and protected and cared for even while hes hurting her Probably its failing to translate across the species divide what with how shes trying to communicate it with caresses and eye movements and Kelthams instead going to conclude that she has a toothache but you know a girl can try

Asking for Keltham to read that much from her eye movements is asking a bit much yeah but if she caresses him he will infer that it indicates affection and secondary infer that he is probably getting at least one thing right

Carissa is more skilled than most dath ilani girls Kelthams age less skilled than that one girl who had invested time into simulated biofeedback oral sex training The reason why Keltham nonetheless gambled on it being safe to date that girl without expecting his infohazardous memory of her to spoil him for all lesser blowjobs forever is that a simple statistical model predicted that Keltham like a majority of men would still find less skilled blowjobs fun even after being exposed to a more skilled one This continues to be true about being blown by Carissa

It doesnt take long for Keltham to feel the burn of pleasure beginning He is under more stress than usual yes but hes also discovered a large new chunk of his sexuality and is with a very pretty woman and he is a teenaged male yet

 One Keltham says Two Three

It would be convenient to be able to multitask here She needs to figure out how shes going to explain things to the girls in the morning because they wont have the excuse of hypothetical Worldwound trauma She needs to understand tyranny better if shes going to seduce Keltham into it Shes getting a headband and should have a plan to set aside some time for thinking once she has it but actually this is quite challenging and shes going to have to set all of that aside for the moment

 She is a competitive person but not such a competitive person she forgets to think about whether she is in fact trying to win here The thing she wants is for Keltham to have a maximally satisfying and seductively evil experience that is not necessarily achieved by beating him Its probably not achieved by losing easily though And its not obviously achieved by losing at all he didnt set her a goal he obviously wants her to fail at or anything okay now setting everything aside to actually focus on the object level problem

She slowed down but not enough and Keltham on Round One wasnt trying to hide any microsigns but he also wasnt deliberately giving her any additional cues of how he was doing like altering his own breathing or letting himself tense up He was curious as to whether Carissa could read arousal microsigns herself

The answer as he predicted in advance is no

Keltham comes into her mouth the smallest amount he can and when hes done doing that pulls her head away grabs both her earlobes with his hands bites with his fingernails and twists

He likes this part Keltham thinks

Carissa will do her best to whimper in a cute way but not in an exaggerated way and not in a way that would reasonably be expected to have any other correlates

Keltham will go on twisting until he expects to be no longer sensitive himself maybe a little longer because hes having fun and then let go to see whether Carissa resumes automatically or waits to be ordered

Waiting very patiently

Keltham is torn between liking the implied obedience and not liking as much the way that pure obedience makes Carissa seem less eager less motivated to do things to him And that sure is a problem he cant solve by giving her more orders But questions about that can wait for a later report to be submitted

 Resume In the future stop when I start hurting you and resume as soon as I stop

All right she can do that And not get distracted this time

Keltham is also working hard on being less distracted widely acknowledged to be the problem of sexuality in dath ilan Hes having fun now he just needs to not think about anything more complicated than that His brain does take this moment to suggest that he review his doubts from Wisdom enhancement time about whether hes investing the correct amount of time into fun at all but this strategy was very obviously generated by the pessimization engine rather than the optimization engine and is rejected at the speed of perceptual reaction

 One Keltham says after a while Two This time hell switch on a slight encouragement of his own visible reactions as he gets closer or further from orgasm muscle tenses changes in breathing Not quite choosing them just encouraging his feelings to express themselves that way

 Distraction is definitely not the problem of sexuality in Golarion Golarion has some other problems And Carissa is going to think about all of them tomorrow and try to win at this today

 Seven Keltham permits himself channels the reaction to tense and hold his breath if Carissa doesnt slow down by a lot shes going to lose round two

Carissa is aiming to lose in opposite directions each time thats how to improve at something if you havent got finer information to work from She can slow way down

Slowing way down will of course cause Keltham to relax his thighs let out his breath and stop counting as he falls out of the somewhere near anorgasm state

Well at least there is an expected correspondence between what she is doing and what hes doing oh no is she also being the kind of terrible sex partner who expects correlations everywhere and will never appreciate Chelish men again somewhat faster then

Keltham will continue to play this game

In a lot of ways once she stops trying to THINK ABOUT THINGS this is the most uncomplicated Carissas life has been Its great

 This challenge is about 80 perception and 20 building a model of Keltham fast enough On Carissas first time trying this its going to be pretty difficult for her to reach a count of 60 And Keltham only has so many partial shots so even if hes enjoying this game and wants to extend it it cant last very long before Keltham calls a halt Carissa needs to roll with her FUK 2 ERO Carissa gets 4 tries at making a DC 20 Perception check

Oh see if Cheliax had known this was a Perception check theyd have brought in a completely different set of people

 Carissa does not make it

Keltham wishes he could extend this game for longer but hes not sure hed have a full shot left in him if he tries for another partial shot based on his past experience and wanting to be conservative about ending this right instead of optimistic about what the new sexual stimulation might do for him

 All right make me come now he says Slowly

He wants to reassure Carissa that therell be other chances for her to win a brief wearing of his shirt but isnt sure how shed take that If it was him hed consider any negative reactions he had to Losing to be his own business So he doesnt say it

All right then

Carissa would not say she is a particularly graceful loser but shes playing a lot of games right now and can handle losing this one And the shirts not that important you never imply you want anything you actually really want on a first date The next game she has moved onto is determine without making things awkward whether Keltham is cuddly after he has gotten off If she just kind of flops against him does he have a visible reaction to that

Slight surprise but not negative surprise If anything hes glad that he doesnt now have to figure out what exact thing to do next He shall immediately snuggle back

Carissa is aware that this is just the female hormones that mistakenly think she might be pregnant and mistakenly think locking down the guy is her best strategy to keep the kid fed but she really really really likes snuggling after sex Especially if it was sex with a lot of violence

Keltham is feeling pretty good about his life right now Later on he can consider exactly what happened when he died in a plane crash such that he ended up someplace with women who want to be hurt during sex and cant be seriously injured except on purpose because he is slightly skeptical about the chances that Golarion was already like that for totally unrelated reasons and Keltham ended up there based on a selection process which did not take that fact into account in any way But thats not a negative update about Golarion

Also that was if not the most pleasurable definitely the emotionally deepest sex of his life even if it was full of having no idea what he was doing So yep cheerful snuggling

Wait does he need to provide her with if not an orgasm further sexual

Keltham decides not to be silly He is pretty sure Carissas Evil answer especially under her current circumstances is that if he just wants to snuggle him just snuggling is fine
